# Due Diligence - Investment Checklist

See [[The Fundamental Theorem of Investing]]

## 1. Clear Understanding of the Business
- What does the company do?
- Major business segments
- Value chain of the business, position of company's activities in the value chain, understanding of the suppliers and customers, consumers
- Major competitors, industry structure/consolidation
- Rank in industry
- Major suppliers, customers
- **How does the company make money?**

## 2. Understanding of the economics of the business 
**Goal is to have a rough P&L statement and CF statement for both overall and per unit product/service sold**.

- Revenue - how is it recorded
- Gross margin (major raw materials and their costs)
- Overhead costs margin
	- Major overhead costs - employee costs, manufacturing, selling, distribution, freight & transportation, commissions and others (extent of economies of scale?)
- Depreciation cost margin
- Interest cost margin
- Tax margin
- EBITDA margin (level of margin? is it sustainable? -> function of barriers to entry)
- Delta (WC) margin = WC/Sales * sales growth (Is it working capital intensive? -> function of bargaining power with supplier and customer? function of barriers to entry)
- Capex/sales margin (Is it capex intensive? -> function of nature of industry, extent of outsourcing, function of where the barriers to entry exist)
- FCFF margin -> understanding of what $1 increase in revenue translates to in terms of increase in FCFF
- ROIC/ROEs
- Current leverage, sustainable leverage
- Assets, asset turnover (high or low asset turnover? Can be increased by higher operational efficiency, or also price increases based on pricing power)
- **What is the level of operational leverage of the business?**

## 3. Understanding the barriers to entry, if any
- Test for the existence of barriers to entry
	- ROIC - high
	- Stable market share
	- Consolidated industry structure (be careful to classify the relevant industry/market - geographically or product/service wise)
- Identify the barriers to entry
	- **Customer captivity**
		- Habit e.g Coke, Pepsi - more relevant for regular small pocket purchases
	- **High switching costs**
		- Network effect e.g. [[Microsoft]] Windows, Office
		- Risk of change/switch e.g. flavors and fragrances
		- Switching that requires money, time and effort
		- Deep entrenchment with customer - planning, logistical software integrated
	- **Search costs** e.g. Professional services, complicated service which cannot be objectively measured, e.g. facility management, security services, fire safety services
	- **Importance of product and service along with a smaller share of wallet** e.g. paints, flavors and fragrance
	- **Access to resources**
		- Access to raw materials - access e.g. Limestone for cement
		- Access to raw materials - proximity e.g Posco for iron-ore
		- Product patents, process patents, trademarks
		- Technology know-how, complicated process, learning curve - *'Soft Patents'*
		- Regulation - Is it temporary and highly uncertain?
	- **Economies of scale** - *Magnitude difference in market share of incumbent with nearest rival within the **relevant market** (relevant market means geographical area or product line)*
		- Generally local economies of scale and is some ways it's the density (concentration) that matters
	- Fixed costs that are spread across a larger number of units e.g. Distribution costs, marketing costs, freight and transportation costs (both inbound and outbound) and bargaining power for raw materials etc.


- Do barriers to entry exist?
	- No -> operational efficiency, management quality
	- Yes - Single Dominant firm structure
		- Single dominant firm - the firm is in a very strong position, take a call on its numbers with this view
		- Other than the single dominant firm - the firm may bot be in a strong position, take a call on its number with this view
	- Yes - almost equally dominant firms (most likely when the number of firms is few in number)
		- Understand the nature of competition; is there a history of the firms co-existing peacefully with each other, thus making the industry highly profitable as a whole? This is most likely to exist if there are a few firms and thus can interact with each other meaningfully

- Does the company have an ability to protect its present and future cash flows?
- Are the company's products cheaper?
	- Does this company have a cost advantage that cannot be replicated?

	- Are the company's advantages so great that the competition is powerless to compete with them?

## 4. Valuation - Putting the above into context
- Use the understanding from above to take a call on:
	- EBITDA margins
	- Delta (WC) margin
	- Capex margin
	- Hence FCFF margin
- Understand top-line growth based on
	- Volume growth for industry
	- Price growth for industry
	- Understanding of 3 above for market share and company factors to translate industry growth to a company growth
- Translating top-line growth into FCFF and FCFF growth using the FCFF margin above
