# You are not entitled to your opinion

> You are never entitled to your opinion. Ever! You are not even entitled to “I don’t know.” You are entitled to your desires, and sometimes to your choices. You might own a choice, and if you can choose your preferences, you may have the right to do so. But your beliefs are not about you; beliefs are about the world. Your beliefs should be your best available estimate of the way things are; anything else is a lie. 



> It is true that some topics give experts stronger mechanisms for resolving disputes. On other topics our biases and the complexity of the world make it harder to draw strong conclusions. 




> But never forget that on any question about the way things are (or should be), and in any information situation, there *is* always a best estimate. You are only entitled to your best honest effort to find that best estimate; anything else is a lie.
