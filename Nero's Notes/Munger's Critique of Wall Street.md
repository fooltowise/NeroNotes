# Munger's Critique of Wall Street

### Wall Street's lack of ethics
The ethics of Wall Street will always average out to mediocre at best. This doesn't mean there aren't some wonderful, intelligent people on Wall Street - there are, like those in this room - but everyone I know has to fight his own firm to do the right thing.
The general culture of investment banking has deteriorated over the years. We did a $6 million deal years ago for Diversified Retailing, and we were rigorously and intelligently screened. The bankers cared and wanted to protect their clients.
The culture now is that anything that can be sold for a profit will be. "Can you sell it?" is the moral test, and that's not an adequate test.


### Salomon Case Study
It's amazing what goes on. Salomon was at least as disciplined and rational as other investment banks but by the end, Salomon was begging for investment business from Robert Maxwell, whose nickname was "The bouncing Czech". You'd think if this was his nickname, investment banks wouldn't be chasing his business.

Buffett: The day they found him bobbing (in the water; he committed suicide as the scandal about his misdeeds broke), we (Salomon) sent money to him in exchange for money he was sending to us, but he didn't pay. So, we went to England to collect from his sons, and it was a mess.

An investment banker's earnings would be increased in a significant way if he wrote a few more tickets to Maxwell. You have to control this if guys can make money by bringing dubious things in the door.


### Normandy America Case study

Warren and Charlie chuckled to themselves as they recalled Salomon doing business with another shady character they didn't name. At the 2002 annual meeting, however, Charlie identified the company as Normandy America Inc., whose IPO Salomon had to pull before money exchanged hands when they discovered the promoter had completely manufactured his record. According to a report on the SEC's website, "Normandy's stock commenced trading on the NASDAQ National Market System on August 15, 1995. One day later, Normandy withdrew it offering from the market and rescinded all trades."

That was a wonderful experience (dripping with sarcasm). Warren, Lou Simpson and I were all on the board of Salomon, we were the largest shareholders, and we said "Don't do business with this guy." But they ignored us and said that the underwriting committee had approved it.

Buffett: He had a neon sign on him saying "CROOK". He did go to jail. Incidentally, he claimed to have owned a lot of Berkshire stick and to have made a lot of money on it, but I checked the shareholder records and couldn't see it. It could have been in street's name, but for a block that big, I think I would have found it (so he was probably lying about his Berkshire holdings.)
