In their *Ergodicity economics*, Ole Peters and Alexander Adamou show that insurances are a puzzle that expected values alone cannot solve.

Let's say that you have a house worth $100'000 and that there is a 1% possibility of it taking fire any given year. You are considering whether to buy insurance that would give you back the value of your house, $100'000, in case it burned down.

The expected yearly value of the insurance contract would be the value of the insured good multiplied by the chance of the insurance triggering. The total is $1'000.

The insurer would want more than $1'000, to cover his operating costs. In contrast, the owner would be willing to pay $1'000 at most. Since these two ranges do not overlap, we would expect insurance contracts never to be signed. In reality, they are common. So, something else must be going on.

Not insuring one's house means that a fire causes his owner to go bankrupt, unless he is very wealthy. In contrast, a single house taking fire doesn't cause its insurer to go bankrupt.

Therefore, the owner is willing to pay a premium to protect himself from irreversibility. The insurer is willing to sell this protection from irreversibility because it increases his own exposure less than it decreases it for the owner. This is because the insurer is wealthier than the house owner and can thus tolerate larger temporary losses without going bankrupt.
