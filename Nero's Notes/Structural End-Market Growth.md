# Structural End-Market Growth
Whereas cyclical growth refers to episodic expansions, structural growth refers to more permanent expansions supported by persistent trends deemed likely to endure. 

The inherent prognosis, however, warrants skepticism, as the observed pattern is in fact often cyclical and merely temporary. Many emerging market trends previously considered structural seem, in hindsight, to have been more cyclical in nature.

Despite this, there are a number of long term trends that are more likely to prove more sustainable than others, ranging from disease prevention to urbanization and aging population in developed markets. But it is not safe to assume, for instance, that all people on earth want to buy a certain number of cars or spend a certain stated portion of income on beer.
