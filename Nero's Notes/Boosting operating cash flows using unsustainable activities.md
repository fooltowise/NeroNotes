# Boosting operating cash flows using unsustainable activities

### Boosting CFFO by paying vendors more slowly

- Look for a sharp increase in day payables outstanding = account payable / COGS * 365. This could mean the company is squeezing its vendors
- Watch for a large and suspicious increase in payables

- Account payable is a relatively straightforward account. If you see a discussion of accounts payables that is longer than a few sentences, there is probably something in there that you want to know.

### Boosting CFFO by collecting from customers more quickly

- Look for a sharp drop in days sales outstanding = account receivables / Revenues *365. 
- While many investors are pleased when management says that it is aggressively managing working capital, you should take this as a sign that recent CFFO growth may not be sustainable.

### Boosting CFFO by purchasing less inventory

### Boosting CFFO with one-time benefits

- Non-recurring boosts to CFFO are not plainly disclosed in the statement of cash flows. Whenever you spot any kind of one-time earnings benefit, ask yourself "How does this boost affects the statement of cash flows?".
