Many companies we have owned over the past decade have large inter-generational family ownership. This reflects the parallels between what we look for and what such family businesses offer: a focus on long-term value creation. In addition, durable dynastic firms typically avoid excessive leverage and use retained earnings rather than serial equity offerings to grow. Family-owned businesses can of course fail, sometimes through misplaced confidence in the abilities of second or third generation managers. Here the distinction between family-owned and family-run is important - research tends to confirm our hunch that [[Corporate Culture]] of family-owned businesses often align them with the criteria of quality investing.

A McKinsey study of global organizational health found that family-owned firms have particularly good corporate cultures, along with high levels of worker motivation and strong leadership.  Another study by researchers at IE Business School in Madrid found that family-controlled firms in Europe regularly outperform peers in market valuation, revenue growth, and returns on assets. Notably, results span geographies and industries, indicating something peculiar about family-owned companies rather than regions or sectors.
