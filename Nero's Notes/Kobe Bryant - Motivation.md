# Kobe Bryant - Motivation

I had a purpose, I wanted to be one of the best basketball players that ever play.
And anything else that was outside of that lane, I didn't have time for.

There's a quote from one of my English teachers at Lower Merion named Mr Fisk.
He had a great quote that said "*Rest at the end, not in the middle.*"And that is something I always lived by. I'm not gonna rest, I'm gonna keep on pushing now.

There's a lot of answers that I don't have. Even questions that I don't have. But I'm just gonna keep going. Just keep going, and I'll figure these things out as we go. Right? And you just continue to build that way. 

So I try to live by that all the time.

At what age did that goal become crystal clear?

I made that deal with myself at 13 years old.

And where did the inspiration come from?

The love of the game, the challenge. Like I would watch Magic play, I would watch Michael play, and I would see them do these unbelievable things. And I said, "You know, can I get to that level? I don't know but let's find out."

And so that curiosity to see where I could push this thing let me down that path, I think.

I had a summer where I played basketball where I was like 10 or 11 years old. And here I come, playing and I don't score one point the entire summer. Not a free throw, nothing. Not a lucky shot, not a breakaway lay up, zero point.

I remember crying about it, being upset about it and my father gave me a hug and said, "Listen, whether you score zero or you score sixty, I'm gonna love you no matter what." Now that is the most important thing that you can say to a child. Because from there I was like "Okay, it gives me all the confidence in the world to fail." I have the security there. But to hell with that, I'm scoring sixty. 

And from there I just went to work. I stayed with it and I kept practicing, kept practicing. I think that's when the idea of understanding a long-term view became important. Because I wasn't gonna catch these kids in a week. I wasn't gonna catch them in a year.

Right? So that's when I sat down and said, "Okay, this is going to take some thought." Right? What do I want to work on first? Alright? Shooting. Alright, let's knock this out. Let's focus on this half a year, six months, and do nothing but shoot. Alright after that, creating your own shot. And you focus on that. I started creating a menu of things. 

When I came back the next summer, I was a little bit better. I scored you know, it wasn't much, but I scored.  Then 13 came around, and then I was just killing everyone. And it happened in two years, and I wasn't expecting it to happen in two years. But it did, because what I had to do was to work on the basics and the fundamentals, while they relied on their athleticism and their natural ability. 

And because I stick to the fundamentals it just caught up to them. And then my body you know, my knees stopped hurting, I grew into my frame, and then it was game over. 

Were you always competitive, from the day you were born?

Competitive with things that I participate in. So I'll put it to you this way. Basketball for me was the most important thing. So everything I saw, whether it was TV shows, whether it was books I read, people I talk to, everything was done to try to learn how to become a better basketball player. Everything. And then when you have that point of view, then literally, the world becomes your library to help you become better at your craft. 

What was really your work ethic like, and for how long did you stay disciplined?

Every day, since 20 years. It was an everyday process and trying to figure out strengths and weaknesses. For example, jumping ability. Man, my vertical was a 40, it wasn't a 46 or 45. My hands are big but they're not massive. So you got to figure out ways to strengthen them, so that your hands are strong enough to be able to palm a ball and do the things that you need to do. Quickness, I was quick, but not insanely quick. I was fast, but not ridiculously fast. So I had to rely on skill a lot more. I had to rely on angles a lot more. I had to study the game a lot more. 

But I enjoyed it though, so like from the time I was, I can't remember when I started watching the game, I studied the game and it just never changed. 

What does losing feel like to you?

It's exciting. Because it means you have different ways to get better. There's certain things that you can figure out, that you can take advantage of. Right? Certain weaknesses that were exposed, that you need to shore up. 

It sucks to lose, but the hardest thing is to face that stuff. That's a really tough challenge. 

How did you get mentally and emotionally so strong where it doesn't bother you?

You gotta look at the reality of the situation. You gotta get over yourself. And after that it's, ok, why did those airballs happen? Got it. I didn't have the legs. I gotta get stronger. I got to train differently. 

And not to say you'll win the next time, but at least you'll give yourself a better chance. It's an obsessiveness that comes along with it. You want things to be as perfect as they can be, understanding that nothing is ever perfect. But the challenge is to try to get them as perfect as they can be. 

And what can you do, it is in your control. So control what you can. 

You have this mindset, but how did you develop that "Mamba Mindset?"
