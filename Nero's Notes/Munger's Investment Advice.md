### The importance of temperament, patience, and curiosity
One of the key elements to successful investing is having the right temperament - most people are too fretful; they worry too much. Success means being very patient, but aggressive when it's time. And the more hard lessons  you can learn vicariously rather than through your own hard experience, the better.

I think there's something to be said for developing the disposition to own stocks without fretting. But temperament alone won't do it. You need a lot of curiosity for a long, long time.

You need to have a passionate interest in why things are happening. That cast of mind, kept over long periods, gradually improves your ability to focus on reality. if you don't have that cast of mind, you're destined for failure even if you have a high IQ.

### Focus Investing
Our investment style has been given a name - focus investing - which implies ten holdings, not one hundred or four hundreds.

Our game is to recognize a big idea when it comes along, when one doesn't come along very often. Opportunity comes to the prepared mind. The idea that it is hard to find good investments, so concentrate on a few, seems to me to be an obviously good idea. But ninety-eight percent of the investment world doesn't think this way. It's been good for us - and you - that we've done this.

What's funny is that most big investment organizations don't think like this. They hire lots of people, evaluate Merck vs. Pfizer and every stock in the S&P500, and think they can beat the market. You can't do it.


We have this investment discipline of waiting for a fat pitch.
 If I was offered the chance to go into a business where people would measure me against benchmarks, force me to be fully invested, crawl around looking over my shoulders, etc., I would hate it. I would regard it as putting me into shackles.
 
 Very few people have adopted our approach. Focus investing is growing somewhat, but what's really growing is the unlimited use of consultants to advise on asset allocation, to analyze other consultants, and so forth. Maybe two percent of people will come into our corner of the tent, and the rest of the ninety-eight percent will believe what they've been told (e.g, that markets are totally efficient).
 
 ### Misteaching Investing
 Beta and modern portfolio theory and the like - none of it makes any sense to me. We're trying to buy businesses with sustainable competitive advantages at a low, or even a fair, price. 
 How can professors spread this nonsense that a stock's volatility is a measure of risk? I've been waiting for this craziness to end for decades. It's been dented, but it's still out there.
 
 Warren once said to me, "I'm probably misjudging academia generally in thinking so poorly of it because the people that interact with me have bonkers theories."
 
 ### Diversification
 The idea of excessive diversification is madness. We don't believe that widespread diversification will yield a good result. We believe almost all good investments  will involve relatively low diversification.
 
 If you took our top fifteen decisions out, we'd have a pretty average record. It wasn't hyperactivity, but a hell of a lot of patience. You stuck to your principles, and when opportunities came along, you pounced on them with vigor.
 
 Berkshire in its history has made money betting on sure things.
 
 ### Sit-on-your-ass investing
 If you buy something because it's undervalued, then you have to think about selling it when it approaches your calculation of its intrinsic value. That's hard. But if you buy a few great companies, then you can sit on your ass. That's a good thing.
 
 We're partial to putting out large amounts of money where we won't have to make another decision.
 
 ### What is a better business?
 
 There are two kinds of businesses: the first earns twelve percent, and you can take the profits at the end of the year. The second earns twelve percent, but all the excess cash must be reinvested - there's never any cash. It reminds me of the guy who sells construction equipment - he looks at his used machines, taken in as customers bought new ones, and says: "There's all of my profit, rusting in my yard." We hate that kind of business.
 
 ###  See's Candy: Case study of a better business
 
 > If See's Candy when we were buying it had asked for $100'000 more, Warren and I would have walked - that's how dumb we were.

Ira Marshall said you guys are crazy - there are some things you should pay up for, like quality businesses and people. You are underestimating quality. We listened to the criticism and changed our mind. This is a good lesson for anyone: the ability to take criticism constructively and learn from it. If you take the indirect lessons we learned from See's, you could say Berkshire was built on constructive criticism.

### Mistakes

The most extreme mistakes in Berkshire's history have been mistakes of omission. We saw it, but didn't act on it. They're huge mistakes - we've lost billions. And we keep doing it. We're getting better at it. We never get over it.

There are two types of mistakes: 
1. Doing nothing, what Warren calls "sucking my thumb".
2. Buying with an eyedropper things we should be buying a lot of.

After nearly making a terrible mistake not buying See's, we've made similar mistakes many times. We are apparently slow learners. These opportunity costs don't show up on financial statements but have cost us many billions.

Since mistakes of omission aren't visible, most people don't pay attention to them. We rub our noses in mistakes of omission - as we just did. (They had just discussed failing to buy Wall-mart stock because it moved up a bit, a $10 billion mistake).


### Buying into stock declines
Over many decades, our usual practice is that if the stock of something we like goes down, we buy more and more. Sometimes something happens, you realize you're wrong, and you get out. But if you develop correct confidence in your judgment, buy more and take advantage of stock prices.

Attractive investment opportunities tend to be ephemeral.

Really good investment opportunities aren't going to come along too often and won't last too long, so you've got to be ready to act. Have a prepared mind.


### Opportunities for small investors
If you have only a little capital and are young today, there are fewer opportunities than when I was young. Back then, we had just come out of a depression. Capitalism was a bad word. There had been abuses in the 1920s. A joke going around then was the guy who said "I bought stock for my old age and it worked - in six months, I feel like an old man!".

It's tougher for you, but that doesn't mean you won't do well - it just may take more time. But what the heck, you may live longer.
I'd work with very small stocks, searching for unusual mispriced opportunities, but it's such a small world.

### Short selling
Being short and seeing a promoter take the stock up is very irritating. It's not worth it to have that much irritation in your life.

### Learning process
I don't know anyone who learned to be a great investor with great rapidity. Warren has gotten to be one hell of a lot better investor over the period I've known him, as have I. So the game is to keep learning. You gotta like the learning process.

I've watched Warren for decades. Warren has learned a lot, which has allowed him to expand his circle of competence so he could invest in something like PetroChina.

If you're going to be an investor, you're going to make some investments where you don't have all the experience you need. Bug if you keep trying to get a little better over time, you'll start to make investments that are virtually certain to have a good outcome. The keys are discipline, hard work, and practice. It's like playing golf - you have to work on it.

If you don't keep learning, other people will pass you by.

### Circle of competence and its boundaries
There are a lot of things we pass on. We have three baskets: in, out, and too tough. We have to have a special insight, or we'll put it in the "too tough" basket. All you have to look for is a special area of competency and focus on that.

If you have competence, you know the edge. It wouln't be a competence if you didn't know where the boundaries lie. Asking whether you've passed the boundary is a question that almost answer itself.

### Cost of capital and opportunity cost
Buffett: Charlie and I don't know our cost of capital. It's taught at business schools, but we're skeptical. We just look to do the most intelligent thing we can with the capital that we have. We measure everything against our alternatives. I've never see a cost-of-capital calculation that made sense to me. Have you, Charlie?

Never. If you take the best text in economics by Mankiw, he says intelligent people make decisions based on opportunity costs - in other words, it's your alternatives that matter. That's how we make all of our decisions. The rest of the world has gone off on some kick - there's even a cost of equity capital. A perfectly amazing mental malfunction. Obviously, consideration of costs is key, including opportunity costs. Of course, capital isn't free. It's easy to figure out your cost of borrowing, but theorists went bonkers on the cost of equity capital. They say that if you're generating a one hundred percent return on capital, then you shouldn't invest in something that generates an eighty percent return on capital. That's crazy.

### Value of forecasts
People have always had this craving to have someone tell them the future. Long ago, kings would hire people to read sheep guts. There's always been a market for people who pretend to know the future. Listening to today's forecasters is just as crazy as when the king hired the guy to look at the sheep guts. It happens over and over and over.

### IPOs

It is entirely possible that you could use our mental models to find good IPOs to buy. There are countless IPOs every year, and I'm sure that there are a few cinches that you could jump on. But the average person is going to get creamed. So if you think you're talented, good luck. IPOs are too small for us, or too high tech - we don't understand them. So if Warren's looking at them, I don't know about it.
