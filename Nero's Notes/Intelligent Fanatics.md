# Intelligent Fanatics


> Our final advantage is the hard-to-replicate culture that permeates Berkshire. And in business, culture counts. Warren Buffett, 2010 [[Berkshire Hathaway]] letter to shareholders.

Companies that can harness the full potential of human capital can build nimble, sustainable operations that are hard to duplicate. In 1992, John Kotter did a comparative study of twenty-two corporations in various industries. He wanted to see whether [[corporate culture]] had any impact on the financial performance of a company compared to its peers. It did.

Of the twenty-two firms in the study, twelve had exceptional performance in relation to industry peers. Over the period from 1977 to 1988, the outstanding firms grew their share price an average of 400% to 500%, compared to their peers' 100% returns, and their underlying return on invested capital averaged 11.13%, compared to their peers' 7.73%. Interviews with industry experts, insiders and financial analysts indicated that the only thing that separated the outstanding companies from their peers was the quality and adaptability of their [[Corporate Culture]].

What elements of those cultures enabled the top companies to adapt and to sustain performance? The common answers were the quality of the leadership, the maintenance of an entrepreneurship environment, prudent risk taking, innovation, flexibility and open communication throughout the company hierarchy. The top-performing companies maintained a small company feel and had a long-term horizon. On the other hand, the lower-performing companies were slower to adapt to change. Interviewees described these companies as bureaucratic, with very short-term horizons. 

The intelligent fanatic CEOs we have looked at here all possess the same qualities as the top companies in Kotter's study. Our case studies show that a corporation's culture is its ultimate competitive advantage, and that it can sustain performance well over a decade. The average time frame for this book's intelligent fanatics was thirty-seven years, and none of these CEOs had a cumulative leadership period of less than thirty years. That is three times the duration of Kotter's study. over that thirty-seven-year average time span, the CEOs produced an average 25% compounded annual return. 

The CEOs represent not one specific period, as in Kotter's study, bit a span of more than a century (1884-2015). A long time frame is important in weeding out a specific period bias or luck, and it includes the effect of many different economic environments. As such, the intelligent fanatic CEOs were able to produce and sustain robust operating performance through nineteen recessions, four panics, the Great Recession, and the Great Depression. There is even representation during an extreme financial environment in the United Kingdom during World War II, as well as representation in multiple industries and countries. Phillip Fisher would have described these outstanding companies as "fortunate because they were able".

Over the remaining portion of this chapter, we will highlight some of the leadership attributes these intelligent fanatics had in common.

### Conclusion

Were the skills, characteristics, and cultures of the intelligent fanatic CEOs and their organizations similar? It is hard to deny the similarities. Regardless of the industry, country, or financial environment, intelligent fanatics were hard at work solving large problems. Not only did they solve problems their customers faced but also they met the challenge of leading growing numbers of employees. Our intelligent fanatics were able to sustain business success
for decades, whereas many other organizations fall into mediocrity.

The intelligent fanatic model provides a blueprint for building dominant, sustainable businesses. Does the blueprint guarantee success? No. But it does give the entrepreneur and investor a template that increase the chances of success. An entrepreneur needs to provide the execution, in concert with particular characteristics to achieve long-term business success. If you are an investor looking to invest early in great companies that are led by intelligent fanatics, then seeking out these characteristics will also be useful to you.
