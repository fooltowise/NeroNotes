# Be a Good Listener
If you aspire to be a good conversationalist, be an attentive listener. **To be interesting, be interested.** Ask questions that others will enjoy answering. Encourage them to talk about themselves and their accomplishments.

Remember that the people you are talking to are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their wants than they are in you and your problems.

**Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.**
