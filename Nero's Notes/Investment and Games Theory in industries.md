### Highlights:
A basic industry **with few players, rational management, barriers to entry, a lack of exit barriers and non-complex rule of engagement** 
is the perfect setting for companies to engage in cooperative behavior.

It is relatively easy to identify those industries where these conditions exist currently (just look  at existing returns on capital), and it is for this reason that **the really juicy investment returns are to be found in industries evolving to this state.**



### Conditions for cooperation

From an investor standpoint, [[Cooperation]] in basic industries is crucial to shareholder value creation. The trick is to identify conditions where cooperative behavior can exist and may evolve, while avoiding those industries where this is unlikely to happen.

For contrarian investors, a history of poor returns in an industry can represent a potential opportunity, since cooperative behavior is more likely to break out if companies are responding to the imperative of balance sheet repair. 

The ideal [[capital cycle]] opportunity has often been one in which a small number of large players evolve from a situation of excess competition and exert what is euphemistically called "pricing discipline". **Having a small number of players is important**, since *retaliation* (say a price cut) is likely to be a more powerful weapon in the hands of a dominant price setter, although barriers to entry are also required to deter opportunistic entrants from taking advantage of any price umbrella.

Certain industries having evolved oligopolistic industry structures, have a potentially favourable capital cycle, and yet persist in generating poor returns. Partly it is because [[Tit for Tat]] is only likely to work where the strategy can be properly discerned.

In the auto industry for instance, there is too much noise in the everyday competitive battle. Carmakers have to decide not just on price, but also on specification, customer financing terms, new model launches, service and warranty terms, etc. This leads to the paradoxical conclusion that product differentiation can be an impediment to achieving supernormal returns. Contrast this with the steel industry or paper producer, whose product is relatively undifferentiated.

Politics can also hinder the operation of the capital cycle. In the European auto industry, for instance, Volkswagen has for many years pursued a market share strategy. At VW, the agenda of the State of Lower Saxony (the largest single shareholder, with 18.2 per cent) has more of a stakeholder than shareholder bent, with an eye to local employment conditions. In [[Airline Business| airlines]], the habit of protecting "national champions" has not died out in Europe as yet. 

Transaction frequency is another feature that can confuse, such as in the airline industry, where decisions  on pricing have been devolved to frontline-managers, creating a competitive battleground akin to death by a thousand cuts. Again, contrast this with an industry such as the automotive glass  industry in Europe, where the three remaining participants enjoy long-term supply agreements and infrequent decisions on new capacity that are signalled clearly in advance.
