**Geoffrey West's big insight is that whatever the scale at which you operate, the organism still needs a network to be provided with energy so it can run smoothly.**

**Exemples:** 
- **Living creatures have circulatory networks (heart, aorta, arteries, veins and capillaries) and respiratory networks**
- **Cities have electricity, water and information networks**

**Therefore, the scaling properties of these entities should be constrained by the properties of their underlying networks.**

He then wants to establish a network theory on which to start to get an idea of the scaling behavior of an average entity. 

His theory relies on three axioms:

**Space filling**: The network takes all the place available to operate. For instance, in the human body there is not any cell that is not deserved by a capillary. In a city there is not any home that is not connected to an electricity terminal. So the networks takes all the room available.

**Invariability of Terminal Units**: the terminal units of a network always have roughly the same dimensions, independently of the size of the entity being examined. A power outlet always measures a few inches whether it is located in a simple home or in the Empire State Building. A capillary is always a few tenths of millimeter wide, whether in a mouse or in an elephant.

**Optimization**: The network is always disposed in a fashion that optimizes what it is doing. The circulatory system optimizes the needed power output of the heart (in this case it minimizes it) so the saved energy can be remobilized for reproduction purposes.
