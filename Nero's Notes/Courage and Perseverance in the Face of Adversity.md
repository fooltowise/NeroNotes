When we hear about successful leaders, we often only see their successes and don't know about their failures or the personal sacrifices they have made to reach the top. Almost all successful people went through incredible hardship, obstacles, and challenges. The power to endure is the winner's quality. The difference between intelligent fanatics and others is perseverance. An unknown writer once said, "97% of the people who quit too soon are employed by the 3% who never gave up."

Take, for instance, John Patterson losing more than half his money in the SOuthern Coal and Iron Company, or Sol Price getting kicked out of FedMart by Hugo Mann. Herb Kelleher had to fight four years of legal battles to get SouthWest Airlines' first plane off the ground. Another intelligent fanatic, Sam Walton, got kicked out of his highly successful Ben Franklin store due to a small clause in his building's lease and had to start over. Most people would give up, but intelligent fanatic are different. They have the uncanny to quickly pick themselves up from a large mistake and move on. They possess the courage to fight harder than ever before, for they see courage more like Winston Churchill did: Courage is going from failure to failure with enthusiasm.
