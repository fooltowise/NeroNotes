# Owner Operators

If you’ve ever founded your own business, you’ll know how important they become to you. For many business owners, their companies become like one of their own children; they nurture and guide them and then watch them grow, and feel every triumph and failure far more keenly than others who are not as emotionally invested within the business might. Some few decide to sell their businesses after a while, yet many others choose to stay with them, remaining with their ‘child’ over time to see it grow to maturity.

I’m sure you’ve heard the saying, ‘_no one works as hard as the owner_’, and this is largely true. No one does. Where other managers and employees might come and go over time, it’s the founder who is there, quite often seven days a week, plugging away at their enterprise, steering and guiding and leading it towards success. And its this commitment to the cause that often leads to remarkable levels of performance.

We’ve covered a lot of different successful businesses in the Investment Masters Class over the last few years: **Aldi, [[Home Depot]], [[Walmart]], [[Copart]], Charles Schwab** and **McDonald’s** to name but a few. And interestingly, one of the most striking features of these businesses has been the fact that ninety percent of them have been run by **Founders**.

You may have also noticed yourself that many of the investors considered ‘_Masters_’ have quite literally filled their portfolios with companies run by either **founders, families or major shareholders who act like such**; **Berkshire, Nomad, Giverny, Baillie Gifford, Marathon** and **Gardner Russo** are some that come to mind.

_“Nomad’s investments may be in publicly listed firms but these firms are also_ **_overwhelmingly run by proprietors who think and behave as if they ran private firms_**_.”_ **Nicholas Sleep**

_“_**_Sixty-plus percent_** _of my investments at the moment and most of the past decades have been invested in_ **_family-controlled companies_**_, which is quite unusual, and it has given us a slightly interesting benefit that to most investors, family-controlled companies suggest more risk, not less risk.”_ **Thomas Russo**

_“_**_Almost ninety percent of the portfolio is invested in firms run by founders or the largest shareholder_**_, and their average investment in the firms is just over twenty percent of shares outstanding.”_ **Nicholas Sleep**

_“The attractions of_ **_\[founding\] shareholder structures_** _explain why companies that enjoy them_ **_form nearly 60 per cent_** _of the International Alpha portfolio.”_ **Baillie Gifford**

And the reason for this is quite simple. Over time, businesses with aligned management have tended to produce some of the **best stock market returns**. There’s a myriad of explanations for this. Let’s delve a little deeper.

Outperformance
--------------

Numerous studies have shown that companies with a long term founder at the helm have outperformed. A 2012 study by the **Harvard Business Review** titled, [**_‘What You Can Learn from Family Business’_**](https://hbr.org/2012/11/what-you-can-learn-from-family-business) highlighted, ‘_when we looked across business cycles from 1997 to 2009, we found that the_ **_average long-term financial performance was higher for family businesses than for non-family businesses_** _in every country we examined_.’

_“_**_Studies such as the one from the Harvard Business Review conclude that founder-led businesses_** _often_ **_outperform professionally managed firms_**_. I would suggest that they do so because the founder's commitment runs far deeper and is often longer-term in nature than that of the professional manager. And commitment and focus is what drives performance."_ **_Ron Shaich, Founder, Panera Bread._**

The **Credit Suisse Research Institute** have made similar findings. Using its proprietary ‘_Family 1000_’ database of more than 1000 publicly listed **family or founder-owned** companies, Credit Suisse has identified that since 2006, the overall universe of ‘**Family-owned businesses**’ have **outperformed non-family-owned companies** by an annual average of **370 basis points**.

Research by Baillie Gifford concurs, “_Our own research suggested that businesses where a_ **_family or founder owned more than 10 per cent outperformed by 3.4 per cent per annum_** _over a fifteen-year period_.”

Trust
-----

Money managers effectively pass stewardship of their client’s capital to the management of the companies they invest in. And as it’s never possible to know everything going on inside a company, it’s paramount they trust management. A useful method to help ascertain management integrity is to study the course of a company’s history - reading every company announcement over the last five plus years until today - soon gives you an understanding of management’s achievements versus their goals. You’ll also get a sense of director behaviour through their buying and selling activity.

_“When you choose to invest with us on behalf of your clients, you’re subcontracting their capital to us to look after. The reality of this process is_ **_we subcontract it to the management of companies_**_. Therefore, seeing they think what we regard as sensible about things is a very important sign.”_ **Terry Smith**

_“Our job is to_ **_pass custody_** _of your investment over at the right price and to the_ **_right people_**_.”_ **Nicholas Sleep**

_“In effect, we_ **_subcontract our portfolio to the boards and managers of the companies_** _in which we invest.”_ **Andy Brown**

If you don’t trust management, then don’t invest.

_“If there is a serious question of the_ **_lack of a strong management sense of trusteeship_** _for stockholders, the investor should_ **_never seriously consider participating_** _in such an enterprise.”_ **Phil Fisher**

_"We_ **_do not wish to join with managers who lack admirable qualities_**_, no matter how attractive the prospects of their business."_ **[[Warren Buffett]]**

Incentives
----------
See [[Superpower of Incentives]], [[Incentives]]

In his 97 years, Charlie Munger has studied incentive-driven behaviour more than most. Yet, even he still feels he under-estimates it.

_“I think I've been in the top 5% of my age cohort all my life in understanding the power of incentives, and all my life I've underestimated it.”_ **Charlie Munger**

A company founder’s incentives are usually in stark contrast to those of a professional management team. A large ownership stake in the business means a founder’s wealth is far more influenced by longer term valuation improvements than a salary. In contrast, a CEO with little skin-in-the-game may be tempted to undertake accretive short term acquisitions or minimise capex & investments to achieve short term remuneration hurdles, even to the detriment of long term value creation.

_"A_ **_CEO faced with 4 years at the helm with financial incentives_** _is unlikely to act in the same way as an_ **_owner-manager_** _with a multi-generational timescale."_ **Marathon Asset Management**

_"All else being equal, favour companies in which management has a_ **_significant personal investment_** _over companies run by people that_ **_benefit only from their salaries_**_."_ **Peter Lynch**

_"If the CEO owns $1 million worth of stock and gets paid $10 million per year, it’s pretty clear_ **_he’ll value his job more than the value of the stock_**_._ **_If he’s paid $1 million per year and owns $50 million in stock, we think that’s predictive of his making better long-term decisions for the company_**_... Where the_ **_founder_** _owns 20-30% of the business... they’ll work with Wall Street because they don’t completely control the company, but at the same time they can_ **_take a longer-term perspective_**_. CEOs with tons of options rather than actual shares can be prone to adopt Wall Street’s short-term focus, which can cause value to be eroded more quickly than you’d think as one bad decision piles on top of another."_ **Adam Weiss**

_“_**_Many corporate CEOs have very low levels of genuine ownership in the firms they manage_** _and are_ **_incentivised_** _primarily on short-term earnings-per-share targets or share price movements. These sorts of_ **_incentive schemes_** **_do not engender long-term thinking_**_.”_ **Baillie Gifford**

Principal-Agency Problem
------------------------

The incentive misalignment is often referred to as the principal/agency problem; what’s in the best interest of the CEO may be detrimental to the shareholders. The presence of a founder can resolve this dilemma.

_“_**_As ownership increases agency costs fall_**_. And like any cost, a sustained fall increases profitability and the value of firm. This effect is born out in our experience and numerous academic studies, dating as far back as the late 1980’s._ **_This relationship between inside ownership and outcomes is not only positive but potentially meaningful_**_. For example, Christoph Kaserer and Benjamin Moldenhauer correlated a 1 per cent increase in inside ownership with ~10 basis points per annum increase in share price performance.”_ **Baillie Gifford**

_“_**_Insider ownership has always seemed to us as the most direct way to deal with the principal-agent problem_**_, which arises with the separation of corporate management from ownership._ **_Our portfolios have tended to be skewed towards companies where successful entrepreneurs run their companies and retain sizeable shareholdings_**_.”_ **Marathon Asset Management**

_“The issue of_ **_alignment of interests_** _is one of the great challenges of modern-day capitalism. Strong governance structures, well-devised remuneration schemes and large management shareholdings can help, but_ **_one of the best ways to overcome this challenge is simply to invest alongside the founders of a business or their descendants_**_. When founders move on, substantial equity ownership by their descendants can still have significant beneficial effects."_ **Baillie Gifford**

Passion versus Pay
------------------

The most profitable businesses tend to be those focused on delivering a customer outcome, not the most profit-orientated. Founders often bring a passion to the business absent from that of professional managers. They are building a legacy, which requires long term thinking. Buffett himself is a good example; Berkshire pays him a salary of $100,000 a year; he resides in the same house he bought in 1958. Berkshire is his canvas. In the insightful book, **Obliquity,** John Kay observed, “**_Many of the businesspeople who talk obsessively about profit are ultimately less successful in creating profit than those who profess love for their business_**_._”

_“The best entrepreneurs we know don’t particularly care about the terms of their compensation packages, and some, such as Jeff Bezos and [[Warren Buffett]] have substantially and permanently waived their salaries, bonuses, or option packages. We would surmise that the_ **_founders_** _of the firms Nomad has invested in are_ **_not particularly motivated by the incremental dollar of personal wealth_**_… These people derive meaning from the challenge, identity, creativity, ethos (this list is not exhaustive) of their work, and not from the incentive packages their compensation committees have devised for them. The point is that financial incentives may be necessary, but they may also not be sufficient in themselves to bring out the best in people.”_ **Nicholas Sleep**

_“One thing that Sam Walton and Mrs. B had in common is they had a_ **_passion for the business_**_. It isn’t all about the money, at all. It was about winning._ **_Passion counts enormously_**_; you have to really be doing it because you love the results, rather than the money. When we buy businesses, we are looking for people that will not lose an ounce of_ **_passion for the business_** _even after their business is sold.”_ **[[Warren Buffett]]**

_“I always look to invest in a manager who has made the company his or her_ **_life’s work_**_.”_ **Robert Vinall**

_“A majority of our managers are financially independent, so that_ **_they don’t go to work because they are worried about putting kids through school or putting food on the table_**_. So they have to have some reason to go to work aside from that.”_ **[[Warren Buffett]]**

_“What matters most:_ **_passion or competence that was inborn_**_. Berkshire is full of people who have a_ **_peculiar passion for their business_**_. I would argue_ **_passion is more important than brain power_**_.”_ **Charlie Munger**

_“We’ve had terrific luck with the_ **_entrepreneurs who basically love their businesses_** _the way I love Berkshire.”_ **[[Warren Buffett]]**

_“I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about factors that influence the long-term success of a business, and I think firms (public or private) that are_ **_run by the founders_** _often have a huge intangible quality to them - one that is crucial to the firm’s ultimate success. This intangible quality is that_ **_the founder is often motivated by much more than money_**_. And that is a driving force that can be incredibly powerful, and incredibly valuable for the owners of those firms.”_ **John Huber**

Tone from the Top & Culture
---------------------------
See[[Corporate Culture]]
This aspect is really quite simple, yet despite its simplicity, its often underestimated or even overlooked altogether. And it is vastly important to the success of any organisation. Higher management set the tone for any organisation. What this means is that when you think of a company’s culture, in its simplest form it is actually derived from the values and behaviour(s) of either the founder/owner or the combined personality of the management team.

And those behaviours of passion and commitment and love for the business are always going to be far more evident in a company that is run by a Founder, than that run by a professional manager or team.

_“[[Costco]]’s founder, Jim Sinegal owned a lot of shares but never made more than $300k a year. How different is that from other company's where the CEO is making $20, $30, $40m or gets fired and gets a $200m golden parachute? That doesn't usually bode well for the long term cultural success of the firm."_ **Paul Black**

Lower Capital Requirements
--------------------------

Investors often give little consideration to the capital required to grow a business. One of the attractions of businesses owned by founders, or in an industry were a founder-led business thrives after decades, is the ability for a company to self-fund growth without calling upon external capital.

_“We are the Groucho Marx of investment. Groucho Marx once said he would never join a club that would have him as a member. We would never invest in a company that needs our money. All the companies we invest in are quoted but the companies are not quoted on the stock market because they need our money. Why are they quoted? They are typically quoted because they were once_ **_family-owned_**_, and when family’s become dispersed a realization has to happen. When we are looking at a sector and we are thinking of investing in it,_ **_we look for a big private company in that sector, that’s been around for many decades, if not longer and has never had to float_**_. Which means we know in that sector companies can grow and prosper and create value without ever ringing up the shareholders and asking for more money. We can’t buy those companies but they give us comfort we are fishing in the right area.”_ **Terry Smith**

_"We usually tend to be in bed with managements who_ **_don't really need the capital markets_**_."_ **Marty Whitman**

Long Term Focus / Jam Tomorrow
------------------------------

All the way back in 1958, Phil Fisher understood the benefits of investing in businesses taking a long-term view.

_“The investor wanting maximum results should favour companies with a truly_ **_long-range outlook concerning profits_**_.”_ **Phil Fisher**

![‘The Hunt for Europe’s Ten-Baggers’, Baillie Gifford 2019.](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/568cf1da4bf1182258ed49cc/1610421102648-LQHFXHEHGQOCU689UMGP/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kAwrZd1XjYQnL7q8xH0v7tR7gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QHyNOqBUUEtDDsRWrJLTmx-YtV7KdJhhcFMxgH7DNwRppyzfDvbdDD0qjI5ziPRitv628iyW-2geWfE-R5D-m/Screen+Shot+2021-01-12+at+2.11.10+pm.png)

**_‘The Hunt for Europe’s Ten-Baggers’, Baillie Gifford 2019._**

Often business decisions that promise long-term value, come at the cost of short-term performance. It might be investing in an overseas expansion which is dilutive to near term earnings, keeping margins low to deter competitors, increasing advertising spend to maximise long-term customer value or increasing R&D spending which has potential long-term benefits.

_“Almost all good businesses engage in ‘pain today, gain tomorrow’ activities.”_ **Charlie Munger**

Professional CEO’s are often reluctant to disappoint Wall Street expectations over concerns of long-term job stability, short-term earnings implications and concern for short term stock price performance.

_“If you owned a business all by yourself, you wouldn’t care at all about maximising reported numbers.”_  **Tom Russo**

_“Our favourite and most frequent acquisitions are the businesses that we buy from_ **_founders_**_. When a_ **_founder_** _invests the better part of a lifetime building a business, a_ **_long-term orientation_** _tends to permeate all aspects of the enterprise: employee selection and development, establishing and building symbiotic customer relationships, and evolving sophisticated product suites.”_ **[[Mark Leonard]]**

_“At best, family control can be an elegant solution to the agency problem._ **_Families are better able to withstand short-term profit fluctuations_** _and to invest for the_ **_long term benefit_** _of themselves and outside shareholders.”_ **Marathon Asset Management**

_“Often family controlled companies have the ability to_ **_look out beyond quarters_** _and that's valuable.”_ **Thomas Russo**

_“Our experience suggests_ **_founder-led companies_** _show_ **_greater propensity to focus on long-term value creation_**_, even when it comes at the_ **_expense of short-term pain_**_.”_ **Baillie Gifford**

A **founder** is less likely to be seduced by the demands of Wall Street.

_“I admire Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos. He has revolutionized the retail industry and has two great qualities: He is patient and persistent, and he_ **_doesn’t care to please Wall Street’s quarterly expectations_**_. This last quality is often overlooked but it is seldom found and represents, in my opinion, a true competitive advantage.”_ **Francois Rochon**

Summary
-------

[[Warren Buffett]] has long espoused the more attractive opportunities in the equities market than the private market. Notwithstanding, he has continued to seek out founder-led businesses for acquisition. In fact, if he had his way, he’d own more.

_‘In the stock market, you get a chance to buy businesses at foolish prices, and that is why we end up with a lot of money in marketable securities. If we absolutely had our choice, we would own three times the number of businesses we own outright.’_ **[[Warren Buffett]]**

Many of the world’s best investors have applied the benefits of his approach to public equities investing.

_“An_ **_owner-operator culture_** _is the central idea expressed in our portfolio. Boiled down to our essential raison d'être, that’s it. We_ **_invest with talented people who have skin the game_**_. In other words, we invest in businesses where_ **_management and/or the board own a significant amount of stock_**_.”_ **Chris Mayer**

_“We seek companies with_ **_owner-oriented management_**_.”_ **Fred Liu**

_“I follow the philosophy, have_ **_your money where the owners are_**_.”_ **Mario Gabelli**

_“We look for_ **_managers who are owners_**_.”_ **Chuck Akre**

_"I invest almost exclusively in_ **_companies with active and engaged owners_**_. Very occasionally, you find managers who think and act like owners even if no owner is present but this is the exception rather than the rule. If a restaurant has an absentee owner, over time the service quality will slip and the waiters will have their hand in the till. With large companies, it is no different.”_ **Robert Vinall**

"We love **owner-operators**.” **Mason Hawkins**

_"We want to invest with_ **_management teams 'that think and act like owners_**_.’"_ **David Herro**

_“If we recognise that portfolio performance is usually driven by a relatively small number of long-term winners, and that these winners most often are run by passionate managers, often_ **_founders or a second-generation_** _with a deep-rooted interest in the success of their offspring, we must then redouble our efforts to find more of this type of company.”_ **David Poppe**

_"I want to_ **_invest with people who have at-risk skin in the game_**_, ideally_ **_founder capital_**_. I like knowing that I and the person calling the shots are in parity in terms of risk."_ **Frank Martin**

_“I try to stuff our portfolio with management teams that ‘get it’._ **_Founders run 45% of our companies_**_; the average tenure of management is fifteen years.”_ **Ryan Krafft**

One of my favourite quotes from Charlie Munger is ‘**_Fish where the fish are_**.’ The starting point is finding the right pond.

_“We’ve bought business after business because we admire the_ **_founders_** _and what they’ve done with their lives. In almost all cases, they’ve stayed on and our expectations have not been disappointed._" **Charlie Munger**

And ultimately, this is profound advice. It’s clear that a great starting place in your search for great investments might be **the pond of companies run by Founders.**
