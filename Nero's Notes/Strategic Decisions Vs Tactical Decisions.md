Strategic decisions are those whose result depend on the actions and reactions of other economic entities. Tactical decisions are ones that can be made in isolation and hinge largely on effective implementation. 

A few examples:

The strategic decisions that a business has to do often fall in two buckets:
- Selecting the area of competition, i.e which market to enter, what to outsource. This will define which external agents the company has to deal with.
- Managing those external agents, and anticipating and influencing their probable moves.

Note that if a market has low barriers to entry and as a result many competitors, the decision to enter the market is strategic, but everything that follows is tactical (mainly skillful implementation). There are way too many players to be able to manage them all.
