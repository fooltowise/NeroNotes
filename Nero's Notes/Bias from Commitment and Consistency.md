We want to be (and be seen) as consistent with our existing commitments - such as the previous statements we've made, stands we've taken, and actions we've performed.

We all see ourselves and want others to see us as reasonable, nice, honest and smart - we don't do dumb things or want to look stupid, weak or dishonest. We believe we make good decisions and do things for a good reason.

We are therefore consistent with our actions and beliefs - and justify them - especially when we have invested a lot of time, physical and mental effort, money or reputation into them. Or made them public.

Also tending to be maintained in place by the anti-change tendency of the brain are one's previous conclusions (see [[The human mind is like the human egg]]), human loyalties, reputational identity, commitments, accepted role in a civilization, etc. 

Bias from consistency and commitment tendency, including the tendency to avoid or promptly resolve cognitive dissonance. Includes the self-confirmation tendency of all conclusions, particularly expressed conclusions, **and with a special persistence for conclusions that are hard-won.**

### Justification of effort

If a person works hard to attain a goal, that goal will be more attractive to the individual than it will be to someone who achieves the same goal with little or not effort. 

Sunk cost fallacy - I have too much invested in this situation to walk away now. I can't afford to write this off. 

### Cognitive dissonance
If a cognitive dissonance occurs, the brain will work extra hard to justify itself.
