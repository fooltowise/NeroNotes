Many companies like Starbucks offer the possibility to their clients to use a prepaid card issued by the company to buy their goods and services.
For instance, in 2019 on aggregate Starbucks recorded a $1.6 billion liability related to the balances customers had on their client cards.

That means that the loyal customers are happy to [[Lending Business| lend]]  $1.6 billion to Starbucks at a rate of 0%. This is a very good financing rate!

Even better, Starbucks estimates that around 10% of the balance is never redeemed, a phenomena called *breakage*.

**That means that Starbucks is receiving financing from its customer at an effective rate of -10%.**

Gift cards and customer cards are a great way to generate [[Float]]
