[[Brands]] have historically served a few key purposes: to guarantee minimum assured product quality and/or to allow people to express their identity in a social context. Brands prospered in an environment of information scarcity, in which an asymmetrical relationship developed between customers and companies. ***There are clear signs that this is coming to an end.*** Brands must be authentic, because there are very few veils left between a business and the public. Everything is on the record all the time in today's information age.  In a highly connected and well-informed world, value to the customer is the most important thing to consider when analyzing a company. Bezos put it best when he said:

> Before, if you were making a product, the right business strategy was to put 70% of your attention, energy, and dollars into shouting about a product, and 30% into making a great product. So you could win with a mediocre product, if you were a good enough marketer. That is getting harder to do. The balance of power is shifting towards consumers and away from companies... the individual is empowered... The right way to respond to this if you are a company is to put the vast majority of your energy, attention, and dollars into building a great product or service and put a smaller amount into shouting about it, marketing it. If I build a great product or service, my customers will tell each others.
