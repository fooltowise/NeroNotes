[[Ergodicity]] is not just the property of an activity. Instead, ergodicity is a property of an activity, its participants, and the exposure of the latter to the former - in short, a system. 

Therefore, there are many ways to reduce ergodicity in an activity by reducing irreversibility:
- Instead of going all-in on a single bet, take many independent bets
- Use protections (insurances, capped downside options, etc)
- Set aside some buffers and reserves so that even if you lose everything you used, you still have some to recover.
