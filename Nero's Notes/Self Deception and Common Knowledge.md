# Self Deception and Common Knowledge


**The value of [[self deception]] does not lie in sabotaging yourself per se. It lies in convincing others that you've sabotaged yourself.** In the game of chicken, you don't win because you are unable to steer, but because your opponent believe that you're unable to steer.

Self deception is only useful when you're playing against an opponent who can take your mental state into account.  It is absolutely useless with a hurricane for instance.

From a [[Games Theory]] point of view, self-deception can work only if it is [[Common Knowledge]].

We, humans, must self-deceive. those who refuse to play such mind games will be at a game-theoretic disadvantage relative to others who play along. Thus we are often wise to ignore seemingly critical information and to believe easily refuted falsehoods - and then to prominently advertise our distorted thinking - because these are winning moves. 

As Robert Trivers puts it, 

> We deceive ourselves the better to deceive others.
