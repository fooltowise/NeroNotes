Essilor, a global leader in making lenses for eyeglasses, has a long history of small bolt-on acquisitions. Individually insignificant, these have become material in aggregate, adding more than 3 percent in annual sales per year for the last decade.

These purchases are most commonly of local optical labs that give Essilor access to a local customer base and better control of its value chain. Pre-acquisition, Essilor might represent 40 percent of a lab's sales, whereas after closing, it would double that level.  Given the specialized  [[Niches| niche]]  and deal size, there is scant competition in this acquisition market, enabling Essilor to purchase companies on attractive terms such as six to seven times cash flows. This ability to systematically improve the operations of acquired businesses is rare but can create significant value.
