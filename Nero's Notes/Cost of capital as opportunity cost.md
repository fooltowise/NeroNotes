# Cost of Capital as Opportunity Cost


Buffett: Charlie and I don't know our cost of capital. It's taught at business schools, but we're skeptical. We just look to do the most intelligent thing we can with the capital we have. We measure everything against our alternatives. I've never seen a cost of capital calculation that made sense to me. Have you Charlie?

Munger: Never. If you take the best text in economics by Mankiw, he says intelligent people make decisions based on [[Opportunity costs]] - in other words, it's your alternatives that matter. That's how we make all of our decisions. The rest of the world has gone off on some kick - there is even a cost of equity capital. A perfectly amazing mental malfunction.
