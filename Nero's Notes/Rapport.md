# Rapport



### 1. Reference books:
- [[How to win friends and Influence People]]
- [[Never Split The Difference]]

Of which a good summary would be:

_To get along with people you need to direct your actions towards their egos. To make people like you, compliment them, talk in terms of their wants, make them feel important, smile big, and remember their name. If you want to persuade somebody, donâ€™t argue, and never contradict them; instead, be friendly, emphasize the things you agree on, get them to do most of the talking, and let them take credit for every bright idea._

### 2. About Human Nature
Make sure you understand human nature and live in accordance with human nature. Water runs downhill, don't try to make it run uphill. See [[Need to Improve Your Relations with Others - Start with Getting Human Nature Right]].



### 3. Criticism is Futile
See First [[Dont Criticize People]].

Or take relationships - getting criticized by your boss or spouse feels much worse than getting praised feels good. In fact, someone said about marriages that positive interactions must outnumber negative interactions by about five to one for a marriage to succeed. (See [[Deprival Super-reaction Syndrome]], and [[How to win friends and Influence People]]) - *All I want to know is where I am going to die so I'll never go there.*

### 4. People want to feel important

### 5. Appeal to interest
You will not be able to change someone by criticizing him. If you want someone to change his opinions or behavior, **Appeal to interest and not to reason.**

The way to change behavior is to have the fear among those doing wrong, the fear that it's going to come home to them and hit them hard.

### 6. Trust is Fundamental
Trust is fundamental in relationships. If I can be trusted to be reliable, this is a huge asset. Mistrust is highly frictional (See [[The High Price of Mistrust]]). "If I need a 50-pages contract to deal with somebody, I will always worry if I did not need a 51-pages contract." -> A seamless web of deserved trust is way more efficient.

### 7. Make Relationships Win-Win
The most important thing is to make daily relationships win-win. You don't want to find yourself in anything else than win-win relationships. Cut out everything else. Bring your share. Provide value to others. See [[The Economy of relationships]].












When you want to question someone's opinion on a complex policy, don't ask them to give you reasons for why they believe as they do - it only makes them defensive and often they stick to their beliefs even harder. Instead ask them to explain in detail how the policy would actually work in reality to accomplish the desired goals - how it step by step could be implemented - the steps and mechanisms involved in getting it done. And also if they have thought through other effects. This often makes us realize that we don't understand as much as we think we do.
