# Rapport

- [[How to win friends and Influence People]]


> Or take relationships - getting criticized by your boss or spouse feels much worse than getting praised feels good. In fact, someone said about marriages that positive interactions must outnumber negative interactions by about five to one for a marriage to succeed. (See [[Deprival Super-reaction Syndrome]], and [[How to win friends and Influence People]]) - *All I want to know is where I am going to die so I'll never go there.


- You will not be able to change someone by criticizing him. If you want someone to change his opinions or behavior, **Appeal to interest and not to reason.**

- The way to change behavior is to have the fear among those doing wrong, the fear that it's going to come home to them and hit them hard.



- When you want to question someone's opinion on a complex policy, don't ask them to give you reasons for why they believe as they do - it only makes them defensive and often they stick to their beliefs even harder. Instead ask them to explain in detail how the policy would actually work in reality to accomplish the desired goals - how it step by step could be implemented - the steps and mechanisms involved in getting it done. And also if they have thought through other effects. This often makes us realize that we don't understand as much as we think we do.


- The most important thing is to make daily relationships win-win. You don't want to find yourself in anything else than win-win relationships. Cut out everything else. Bring your share. Provide value to others. See [[The Economy of relationships]]

- Trust is fundamental in relationships. If I can be trusted to be reliable, this is a huge asset. Mistrust is highly frictional (See [[The High Price of Mistrust]]). "If I need a 50-pages contract to deal with somebody, I will always worry if I did not need a 51-pages contract." -> A seamless web of deserved trust is way more efficient.
