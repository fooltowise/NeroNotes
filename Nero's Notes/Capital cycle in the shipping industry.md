# Capital Cycle in the Shipping Industry

The global shipping industry provides a classic example of a [[Capital Cycle]].
Between 2001 and 2007, daily rates for "Panamax" class ships rose tenfold as China's rapidly increasing share of global trade boosted shipping demand. 

New orders in the shipbuilding industry are strongly correlated with daily spot rates. The supply responses was inevitable if not immediate - *it takes up to three years for a new ship order to be delivered.*

Between 2004 and 2009, however, the global dry bulk fleet doubled from 75 to 150m deadweight tonnes. 

The effect of this new supply combined with the global slowdown resulted in a 90 percent fall in Panamax daily rates, which wiped out  all the gains from earlier in the decade. 

An investor who bought into shipping in the summer of 2007 before the onset of the financial crisis would have lost two thirds of his money. Shares in shipping companies, such as Denmark's Maersk Group, were down a similar amount. New ships, which had been ordered during the boom years, continued to be delivered long after the downturn.
