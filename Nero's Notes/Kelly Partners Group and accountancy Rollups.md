### Richard, can you share some context to back when you first joined Stockford, many years ago?

I was a Group Executive for St George Bank, in their investment services business. One part of that was a company called Silcorp which was one of Australia’s first and leading master trust in ancillary services. As part of their strategy, they were looking at how they would build an ecosystem and Stockford was about to go through an IPO at that stage. We got a very good price to go into Stockford, pre-IPO, and they were going to form an alliance with St George, to back up one part of their strategy, which was to build out wealth management and offer that through all of their rolled up accounting practices.

We did that investment and I was the responsible executive for that area, so I went onto their board, and that’s how I got involved in Stockford.

### What was Stockford’s strategy?

They thought there was an opportunity to create an accounting practice of scale, by rolling up and creating a branded offering in the marketplace, around accounting practices. They were acquiring practices for somewhere between 0.9 times revenue up to about 1.2 times revenue, depending on the type of revenue. They were looking at how they rolled up those practices and they thought there was a significant arbitrage between what public markets would reward and what they could acquire that revenue and those businesses for.

They had a focus on small business. They also had a focus on the entrepreneurial side of it and then on the larger private clients. In that sense, it is a bit like Kelly+Partners.

### So focusing on SMEs but also trying to cross-sell wealth management business?

Pretty much, but behind every small business is a small business owner and so it’s the wealth management around that entrepreneurial area; that was where the focus was.

### Is that where all of these businesses eventually head? Is that where the money really is, in the long run, in terms of getting hold of those assets and managing them for the clients? Stockford, Kelly, WHK and these other businesses all seem to gravitate towards getting access to wealth management business.

That was clearly WHK, right from the get go. They did a far better job at integrating the wealth management practices into the accounting firms. It expressed an interest in understanding why the central costs, within Stockford, were so high. They wanted to create value for the group by doing wealth management out of the central practice and then do a revenue share, back to each of the practices. All of those costs for marketing the wealth management practice and some of the related infrastructure for the wealth management were borne by Stockford central office and they would be distributing some of the profits back to the practices that had been rolled up.

That never really occurred so the costs were never really fully recouped. Whereas in WHK, the IFAs were put out into each of the practices, to the best of my knowledge.

### So Stockford actually had all those IFAs at a centralized cost base?

Yes. In retrospect, I’m not sure it was ever agreed what those revenue splits would be and that created a degree of contention. The wealth practices never really got to any critical mass, through Stockford.

### I guess that was also because the incentives weren’t completely aligned at the practice level?

In fact, I think that goes to the heart of the questions I always have around why do you roll up and why professional services? Rolling up is all about incentives. Are the incentives aligned? What are the benefits to the practices, to roll up? If it is purely succession planning and allowing people who have built a professional services practice to cash out and to keep running their business for a while, then I think it’s fraught. There needs to be some benefit to the roll up and I think those benefits really come from scale. There has got to be scale benefits and that can come from needing capital. I think that is probably the biggest distinguisher between that and the dentistry roll ups. Dentistry is, implicitly, a capital-intensive business and if you can provide the capital through the public markets, at a lower cost, you are benefiting everyone in your network.

But if you don’t need the capital – and pure professional services only need working capital – that capital benefit is not there. Then there is purchasing scale. I think you can scale on the cost side, how you scale up and grow. If you think about Steadfast, OAMPS and the other roll ups in the insurance market, they were based firmly on their supply arrangements. The bigger they were, the better deal they got from their insurance backers and the more they could then deploy capital into providing insurance agency and other related business. All of that just added a lot of benefit to it. If you also need to invest in systems, you need to disperse or defray that across a large revenue stream, so that’s another example of a scale benefit.

Apart from that, the other one is really cost of acquisition benefits, in terms of customer acquisition. That relies on practices needing growth and I’m not so sure that pure professional services businesses rely on growth. They are basically lifestyle businesses for the founders, but once they get to a certain size, they don’t really want to work that much harder, so more business is not really a major driver.

I think pure professional services, without either scale or acquisition benefits, doesn’t work particularly well. Whereas in other areas, where roll ups work, those benefits come through pretty strongly.

### If you look at Kelly+Partners, for example, around 50% of the cost base is labor?

Yes; if not more.

### You might get some scale benefits on procuring accounting systems or software?

They’re small.

### What are the real scale benefits from in accountancy roll ups?

For the large professional services firms, such as the EYs and the KPMGs, it is around their recruitment and workforce management. It is around recruitment, training and the ability to deploy larger workforces on an ad hoc basis, as well as on a consistent basis. But that’s not the small SME accountant.

### Putting aside the fact that some of these guys probably don’t need or want to acquire more customers, even if they were, how does that work?

If you’ve got a one-brand strategy, which Stockford had, it made sense, because you could use that for customer acquisition; you would build a brand around that. Even then, that didn’t last very long because each of the underlying practices were, quite rightly, fond of their own name. So we ended up creating Stockford XYZ, to try and get some benefit from a central brand. At that stage, web marketing was not such a big thing; now it certainly is and can drive traffic. But the issue is, where do you get growth? In a public company space, you need the benefits of being a public company, at a lower cost of capital, but it expects growth and it expects that return on growth, which is savings and revenue growth. If you’re not driving that, I think roll ups are pretty hard.

From what I’ve looked at with regard to Kelly+Partners, they are trying to drive that growth and they are trying to drive the benefits out of it. They are focused on the right things; I’m just not sure the comparables in the insurance broking market are the same comparables. For instance, if you are an insurance customer, once you have sold them a premium, the repeat premium is almost locked in the bag unless you really do a bad job. That is similar in the wealth management business.

This comes back to your question. In all of these areas, what they really see, is their ability to create recurring revenue streams through wealth management and that has strong returns to scale. If you can build a large book of business, then you’ve got strong returns from scale, from having billions of dollars of assets under management. That is where I can see some scale benefits in Kelly+Partners, if they can really bring to life their wealth management aspirations.

### It’s almost as if you are rolling up the SMEs private clients, to then get access to some of the assets that potentially have scale benefits?

We look at other roll ups in the financial services space and the IFA distribution and they haven’t been fantastically successful either. That’s because, basically, for professional services firms, their largest cost is people and that’s not scalable. There has to be those drivers of scale benefits or acquisition benefits into an organization that wants growth, for roll ups to be a compelling example.

Certainly, the arbitrage exists; public markets prepared to pay for revenue. But it means that you have always got to be on the acquisition trail and that’s hard yards.

### You mentioned how, for the typical SME practice owner, it’s a lifestyle job and they don’t necessarily want growth, so why do they sell to a group such as Kelly?

I can’t speak for them, but if you’re in your late 40s or early 50s, you’ve built a practice and you’re finding it hard to get resources – and resources are attracted to bigger organizations – you’re looking at how you extract the value of all of the career that you’ve built in your practice. You can call it succession planning, but it’s actually a liquidity event for people that are either at, or can see, the end of their career.

### One question I had was, why are accountancy firms partnerships in the first place? Why are the big four not public?

If you don’t need capital, then you’re looking at an earn out and, effectively, it is a structured personal services endeavor, I don’t think there is a real driving example into the public markets. From my own history, looking at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, when they became public, they did so because they became capital hungry, to drive their trading desks and their principal activities. But while they were just brokerages and straight investment and advisory firms, not doing much underwriting, the capital needs were incredibly light so the return goes to the people who are involved in the business. That sounds like a partnership to me; it doesn’t sound like a public company.

### Let’s say, I’m running an SME practice and Stockford is looking to acquire my business. What would the typical structure be?

Stockford and Kelly are quite different; Kelly is probably much better aligned. Stockford bought 100% of the businesses, with some buy back entitlements for some of the people, for equity in Stockford. They were paying a little bit of cash out, but it was mostly in stock and they acquired 100% of the organization. The incentives were great while Stockford’s share price was going up. As soon as it turned around, the incentives were appalling, because everyone wanted to own their own business again.

### So selling partners only received a very small amount of cash, up front?

Whereas, I think, for Kelly, they are really working hard on the lessons that are coming out of it and trying to make sure that their incentives are aligned. They’re trying to create perpetuity structures. Their 10-year automatic rollover is a way of making a partnership look more like a company; you’ve got longevity in the equity position or in the partnership.

### Although it’s not clear what the break clauses are. There is a large minority interest in Kelly; all the opcos have 49%. How do you look at the incentive structure of that, where you have such a large minority interest in the business?

I think they’ve got an incentive to drive adequate revenue, at a practice level. They’ve got real incentives to drive cost. The way that they’ve structured debt, which is at the subco level, they’re creating real business incentives down at that partner level; I think you’ve then got to say, what’s the benefit of being together? It is either central cost benefits or customer acquisition benefits. Do the underlying firms want that growth and that customer acquisition? How much growth do they really want in their practices?

If it’s going to come to your wealth management, everyone is happy; or not unhappy.

### Because the opcos pay 5% for central office management and another 4% for, effectively brand marketing, they’re paying 9% of revenues up to the holdco, anyway, just for running the back office?

Yes; and you’ve got to fund all of your technology out of that 5% and all of your operations. That’s a pretty light model, unless it is additive to what is already going on in the operations, in the operating companies. But I can’t imagine the operating company want to be putting as much as they can into that 5% and stripping costs out of their own business, to increase their own returns, which would be the smart thing to do.

### What really went wrong with the incentive structure at Stockford?

While the share price was going up, the incentives were absolutely aligned. As soon as they were misaligned, people could see that a dollar worth of revenue was worth 2X or 3X revenue in the marketplace. There was real benefit to keep on driving revenue. Once it came down, people were worried about how much costs they were paying to central and what their returns were, coming from it, and they were then looking at the stock price going down. That became a negative spiral, in the sense that they weren’t seeing the benefit from central and they weren’t experiencing any benefit from the group. They were being asked to work hard but they were still earning a salary. There became a misalignment of incentives on the way down.

### Could that happen with Kelly, if the stock turns?

Actually, I think Kelly has learnt some real lessons out of the roll ups. I’m not sure that they are going to get everyone to play nicely in the sandpit together, because they’re not owned. But all of them have an incentive to run their businesses well. That’s a great story. If everyone is running their businesses well and the central is adding value, either on technology, operations or other areas, then you’ve got a great platform; but where does the growth come from?

I think they’ve managed the downside well, relative to other roll ups, but my big question would be, where does their growth and their returns to shareholders come from, without just perpetual acquisition?

### In terms of how the structure is different, in Stockford the partners received 100% equity plus maybe a little bit of cash. Kelly doesn’t actually issue any equity; I think they fund most of the acquisition with debt. Part of the working capital and vendor facilities are actually at the opco level, to make them really incentivized to run their business very lean. But Kelly only buys 50% of the practice. Does the practice receive any cash up front?

In looking at the prospectus, it looks as if the practices do receive cash; I’m just not intimate enough with the model. It looks as if there is fair value given for that 51%.

### So the partners get a good payout on day one and then they are also part of a group that makes their life easier, plus they have an opportunity to grow?

Yes; and my guess is that there is an earn out; it wouldn’t just be all cash up front. There is likely to be an earn out, plus the existing partners are getting 49% of what they would have got before.

### How did the practices at Stockford react when the share price went down?

The morale was not good, at the end of it. Some of the practices wanted to leave and they did have exit rights. The CEO really tried very hard to rally the troops, but once the incentives were misaligned, it’s pretty hard. That’s where Kelly+Partners have got it pretty much right on the incentive front. They are incentivized on both the upside and the downside.

### I’m just thinking about how this structure is very different from a typical roll up. As you said, most other roll ups, that have real scale benefits, they can purchase 100% of the company, roll some of the earn out into the equity of the holdco and it can work quite well, if there are real synergies and scale benefits?

Yes. If you look at 1300SMILES and the dentistry roll ups, they’re actually fairly capital intensive and there is a benefit from being one brand; they need regular customer acquisition, as a core part of their business. There are two driving reasons to come together.

On the insurance broker roll ups, there are scale benefits wherever they look, both on the operating cost, on their core infrastructure, but also on their ability to buy insurance. Additionally, their ability, in the insurance agents, to create particular pools and get a better deal from understanding their customers’ risks and centralizing that risk.

### What was Stockford’s growth strategy, in helping to drive growth at the opco level?

They were marketing very heavily into those practices but the willingness of each of the sub-practices to grow and take customer referrals was mixed. Some were fantastic and just rocked and rolled and some were not. The wealth management area was seen as being a big growth driver, which was the interest for St George in the first place.

### Is it very difficult for the opcos, prior to being part of a bigger holdco, to get access to wealth management?

You can get access to them easily but, as you get access to them, you don’t get the benefit of scale; that goes to someone else. Everyone sees that the asset management fees on a billion dollars is worth a lot of money and they look at how much wealth their customers have and they think, if we can manage that, that’s a good return.

### When a practice left Stockford, how would the exit actually work? Could they take all their clients again?

When that was happening, I’d left St George and resigned my board seat at Stockford, so I’m not exactly sure how that end game played out.

### I guess the whole value in the business is the book of clients and the customer relationships?

That’s true, but in reality, who owns the client? The client. If they want to get serviced by the guy that was servicing them for the last 15 or 20 years, it doesn’t matter what you say, they’re going to go and get serviced by that person. In financial services, there is a lovely habit of talking about customer ownership and I think most professional services miss the point. The customer owns themselves and you’ve got to keep earning that and relationships win. Particularly in accounting practices, where I’ve formed a relationship with my accountant, I may have formed a relationship with the firm, but I don’t think about that; I think about the people I’ve formed a relationship with and they are the ones that provide that service on a daily basis. That’s where my loyalty sits.

### Even if there are some kind of terms where the practice can’t take the clients, the client can do what they want?

Exactly; and they do. In some of the wealth management practices, the experience has been that, when the advisor leaves, as much as they try and maintain the balances, the client goes. The client owns themselves and, if they’ve got a strong relationship, they’ll go where the relationship goes.

### As you said, incentives are the number one priority when you are rolling up assets. What are the principles that you would take away from that experience that you think are crucial to aligning incentives?

It has to answer the question, what is in it for me, on both sides. While they can be different, they can’t be completely misaligned. There has got to be a reason for us to trade and a benefit from that trade that can sustain different environments. That is where Kelly has done a pretty good job.

It makes integration very difficult and very hard and so how they get cost benefit of it, I don’t know. But they’ve got aligned incentives and it is aligned on both the upside and the downside. The things that I look at, in roll ups, is what are the incentives, what are the scale benefits and what are the growth benefits? If there is not a coherent story on all of those, then I’m not a fan of investing in roll ups.

### In that case, the incentives seem aligned on the upside and downside. Arguably, there are little cost benefits from scale but, potentially, huge benefits from growth, if the wealth management opportunity plays out?

That’s the way I’m looking at it, whether it’s right or wrong. I’d like to understand, from the company, where they see that earnings growth coming from. If it’s just practice customer growth, that’s difficult in a professional services firm. If it’s coming from cost synergies, then you want to see what and how long that investment is going to take and what sort of consistent returns you will get from it. Then it’s going to come down to, what other scale benefits are in their plan.

### However, Kelly does report that they drive margins up from sub 20% EBITDA to over 30%, post-acquisition.

That is seriously aligned with the practices. The practices are then getting a dynamite benefit from it. I can understand why practices are saying, hey, this is a good thing. As long as the practices aren’t getting disadvantaged by it and they’re getting a shared benefit from cost out, then everyone is looking good.

### That either has to come from massively reducing the costs or driving more business?

A bit of both. It is a bums on seats business, so it’s hard to get scale in that client side, unless you can grow each of those practices.

### Where do you think that could be coming from?

I presume it’s on the cost side, on their central operations side and it appears as if they have done a good job there. But it’s going to be a balance; it’s not all going to be one thing. I think they’ve done a great job on margins. Is that a one time hit or is it an ongoing hit? To keep that earning growth that you get from margin growth, do they need to keep on acquiring or can they grow their existing businesses?

### You mentioned how Stockford’s cost structure, from the public documentation, it seems as if it was really bloated, especially relative to Kelly. Was that due only to the wealth management practice being at the central HQ or were there other reasons that drove costs?

They had a big technology play of trying to put in central technologies and central CRM and other components, such as central marketing and I don’t think they ever really panned out.

### Just mismanagement of spend?

Not so much mismanagement, but I think the benefits from it were never realized. It relied on the practices willingly adopting new methods of work and new technologies and there is a degree of resistance there. The alignment behind brand, the desire to get more customers and to give up control of their own marketing and fiefdoms; that was always fraught.

You’re talking about people that have built and run their own business and, all of a sudden, they are an employee.

### And you’re trying to tell them to use some kind of software solution?

Again, Kelly+Partners have learnt those lessons. They are saying, we will generate returns by using X, Y and Z; that is aligning the interests.

### They do also claim to have certain strategies or manuals or central office management systems that the opcos could use to drive costs. There is still some reliance on the practices adopting those methods, to drive growth?

Yes. But if you are demonstrably lower cost, with the same or better quality the way they’ve structured it, the partners would adopt it. Whereas the ex-owners of the Stockford practices were now getting a salary from Stockford, roughly based on their revenues and the incentives, again, were misaligned.

### They couldn’t see the benefit because it was rolled into their equity which was based on the market value?

And it meant giving up their freedoms and control.

### How would you describe a typical Stockford partner when they were acquired? Were they typically much older? I think Kelly’s is around 41; was it similar?

No; it was people in their late 40s and into their 50s and some in their 60s. If I look at the prospectus in Kelly+Partners, 41 is a surprise to me.

### It goes back to the point you made about the fact that these practices have to want to grow and maybe the younger practice owner still has that drive?

But you’ve only got 24 hours in a day and you may not want to work seven days a week. Then, like all large professional services firms, it becomes about how you can recruit, with good quality control, in lower cost resources that allow you to scale and to maintain the partners’ share and the partners’ interest. That’s where the large accounting practices have done pretty well, in their recruitment, training and then deployment of resources. In law firms and large accounting firms, each partner sits on a very productive engine, underneath them.

### Was Stockford doing the hiring, running the HR for the practices?

They were running HR but it was, effectively, an outsourced recruitment and contracting service, to each of the practices. They wanted to get into training but didn’t manage to get into it, from what I remember.

### What do you think is the optimal hiring strategy for a roll up like this?

I don’t really know enough about the detail. From what I’m seeing, accounting is getting really heavily disrupted by technology; the AIs, the low-cost bookkeeping services, the balance matching and order reconciliations. That should make the partners and practices far more productive, but they require a degree of technology savvy and adoption. That’s a wild field; just think about how much it’s shaking up all the large professional services firms. It is way beyond my pay grade to figure out what their recruitment and training strategy should be.

### Would you allow the opcos to recruit? I assume that HR would be a central cost that you could, potentially, get some scale benefits from. Therefore, you do take that away from the opco, which could be quite difficult if this partner has to go up to Kelly and get a new employee or PA?

If I’m right about machine learning coming down from larger organizations into the SME area, that is going to have to be centrally driven. The investment, the training and the deployment will be out in the opcos, but the creation, the practices around it and the quality control and development of it is going to be internal. It is going to be a central resource; I don’t think you can afford to do that at a practice level. But I don’t know the extent to which they are seeing that pressure and the opportunity to reduce costs further, by using machine learning.

### What are the other risks you see of costs increasing at the holdco level, for accountancy roll ups?

If they can survive on 9% and provide all the services that are in their prospectus, they are a very efficient operation.

### It makes me think about what they are actually given. What can you get for 9%?

The proof of the pudding is in the eating and they seem to be extracting margin and it seems to be sustainably extracted out of the businesses. There is something there that is a bit of secret sauce.

### How would you describe the typical SME practice, in terms of the cost base? Are these practice owners inefficient?

I think there is a difference between being inefficient and not being fully efficient. Most of the accounting practices that I know are not inefficient, but they are not necessarily as efficient as they could be. They are small businesses and a small business has to be over their digital marketing, their marketing, their technology, their labor hire and all of these areas that just kill all small businesses.

The benefit of having one standard, well thought out employment contract, that you don’t have to go to someone to pay, every time you’re doing it, not only is that value in the cost, it actually frees up time and stress points. Doing your own pure practice management, they are things that take time away from generating returns for any professional services outfit. If you can really constructively approach how you take those costs out, you are giving time back to the practice. That is of immense value, whether you use it to take time off and work a bit less than 60 or 70 hours or whether you go out and get more revenue; that’s real value.

I don’t think it’s an issue of inefficiency; I just think there are some efficiencies of scale. Whether they are one time or continuing and whether they allow a continual growth level in their companies, to me, that’s the question. What is their growth strategy and can they continually improve margin?

### It could be a one-time step change, as they join Kelly, from 20% to 30%, because the partners are not doing all the back office jobs and are focusing on being leaner or driving more revenue, as opposed to continuous organic growth?

Then it has to come through either on continual cost to income decline, so you are getting to a stage of fixed cost on some things. That is the asset management world, trying to get to the wealth management side. Or you can cheaply acquire customers if you can service them.

### Did Stockford acquire customers cheaper, at scale?

No.

### Why was that?

At that stage – we’re talking 20 years ago – the prime sales people were the partners and near partners in each of the practices. You could do marketing but it had to get closed by the partner or near partner. These are relationship and trust businesses. You can’t do an online sale for this easily. In the end, the sale is made by the service delivery team. Good, hot leads are fantastic from your marketing function, but it has to be closed at the practice level, I think.

### You can buy TV ads and do brand marketing but, at the end of the day, you need to get the customer in the door?

That’s right. And once they’re in the door, you need to meet and greet them like someone who wants their business and has the capacity to do it.

### Which is partner time?

Without a doubt.

### The most expensive asset they have?

Correct; partner or near partner. In the end, we’re all pushing on the same resource. You’ve got to free that resource up in the way that they are really interested in growth. To me, this is all around incentives; incentives for growth and for building and maintaining business.

### The thing that is also interesting is that Kelly needs to find the right partners; those that are relatively younger, that want growth. Are there many of those people out there?

I don’t know. What I’m hearing about the accounting profession is that there is lack of people coming into the profession. The people that are feeling that most acutely are in that mid-career area. The technology and other pressures on these firms are really putting a crunch on those people in their really productive years; their late 30s into their 40s, where they are really wanting to grow their businesses.

The solution will come down to how you support them and give them an exit path and a growth path.

### I know it was 20 years ago, but looking back, what was the turning point in the stock for Stockford? Was it just that the costs were bloated or lack of revenue growth that turned the market value? What was the inflection point in the market’s perception of Stockford?

Firstly, it was 2001 and the market turned pretty severely. An awful lot of the small cap and the more speculative areas of the marketplace got really badly punished. Stockford was definitely one of those. Everyone would love to blame it on the market, but no.

Additionally, you’ve already pointed out that the costs looked high; they weren’t generating the growth in that part of the business to warrant it. Whatever started driving the stock price down, the incentives within it had a snowballing effect. I don’t think Stockford delivered on cost savings to the practice. For whatever reason, as a group, it did not drive revenue growth and it didn’t drive profitability enhancement. If anything, average returns – which is what Kelly has avoided – went down and it was forced to keep on acquiring to do revenue growth. If I recall, it was getting slightly negative growth across the board, from its practices.

### Was that due to the owners not feeling incentivized to grow, as well as the clients leaving?

In my personal opinion, quite a number of people saw it as an exit and not as a way of growing their business and not as a way of passing it onto some eager person that wants to keep paying them for a period of time. Some of them were escrowed for a year or so and, as soon as the escrows came off, that’s when people started to sell.

### They just sold their stock and they were out?

Yes.

### That’s the other thing about Kelly that is particularly interesting. Stockford seemed to be acquiring many more businesses than Kelly; maybe it was a function of the model not working that meant they had to acquire more. Kelly seems to be relatively slower; picking off one or two a year and integrating them?

And I think they seemed to be picking up the right ones, that were aligned. From the research that I’ve done in Kelly, they seem to be a good, strong business. Whether they are a long-term growth prospect, that is where I go back to the questions about whether they are getting scale and growth benefits. They are the questions that I would have. In principle, I’m not a fan of roll ups until they can demonstrate those benefits.

### The multiple arbitrages seem pretty attractive. You mentioned, roughly, one times revenue that you were purchasing and, I guess, that was three or four times cash flow?

There’s a good arbitrage there. But if that is the reason you are doing it and that there are no other benefits, I’m not sure roll ups make sense. That is a bit like pass the parcel. Once you have achieved it once, you will never get it again.

### So how do you grow these businesses? We’ve spoken about customer acquisition growth and that is pretty difficult, given what said about the nature of the sales flow; meeting the partner and going into the practice. What are the other key avenues that Kelly could use to really grow?

I think, create time, which is what you implicitly said early on. If you can create real efficiencies, that free up partner time for them to put that into productive enterprise, you are getting that step change in performance. If you are then adding ancillary services, particularly wealth management, insurance and other services to those that are being supported by central sales channels or other product opportunities, you can leverage those trusted relationships to drive further cross-sell opportunities. That’s hard, but I think if you can do it, you can do well.

### How would you do it?

The best people doing this, around the world, seem to be heavily incentivizing cross sales. Accounting practices are quite conservative and I think that’s another good reason for the strategy of the average age of 41 year old. They are likely to be less conservative than people that feel that their business is at risk. They are more growth oriented and, therefore, they are prepared to try different avenues of growth.

### If I understood you correctly, Stockford actually had these IFAs, at the holdco level and they were trying to get the practices to push business, or cross sell, to those internal IFAs?

That’s right.

### In your opinion, what would be a better solution than that kind of structure?

What WHK tried to do and, I think, did quite successfully, is that they put the IFAs into the practice; they were more successful at wealth management than Stockford. They centralized only the wealth management operations, not the wealth management sales and client relationship. They held those at the opco level.

They got both the buying benefits and the consolidation benefits, but they had the relation benefits of the holdco and the scale benefits being driven by the central business.

### They were getting better access to the fund management side of things and all those fee structures?

The big one in the wealth management business is tying to funds under management and getting a fund-based fee; that’s the holy grail.

### That just goes back to my point around how difficult it is, with the clients of the practices – the SME owners, using the accountancy services – to gather those funds, such as the pension money? Where is this money already in Australia?

In Australia, the accounting practices are the largest set of administrators of self-managed superannuation funds. Self-managed superannuation in Australia, is a globally significant business, with $1.7 trillion of assets under management. That is, by far and away, administered by accountants. There are some large administration businesses but, compared to the 400,000 or 500,000 funds out there, they pale into insignificance compared to the accountants. The holy grail is, actually, the superannuation balances.

### Is this held at the big four in Australia?

No; the SMSFs – the self-managed superannuation funds – are predominantly SMEs. They are the small-business owners that have their own super fund and wealth retirees.

### These are invested but self-managed?

Yes; they are self-managed and, most commonly, advised. They need an accounting system to be able to service and do their tax returns but they are self-managed. It is like a US 401K; they are the self-directed retirement vehicle. They need to be administered and, by and large, the administration is done by smaller SME accounting practices. There is an enormous amount of money there.

### Those SME accounting practices would refer the funds to one of these fund managers in Australia?

They generally refer them to financial planning practices and they see those practices making a lot of money and think, I want a piece of that. Some of them have been successful; many of them have not been.

### Are there no large, listed IFAs in Australia?

They come and go. Again, it’s a professional services business.

### In the UK, we have these other bigger groups that are rolling up IFAs, that seem to be doing pretty well; St James’s Place, for example. Are there none in Australia that have consolidated that market?

It comes and goes. There have been various attempts at rolling it up, in a snowball group. People are trying to do it and to roll them up, but unless you own the underlying mechanics, they suffer the same problem as other professional services businesses. When the individual IFA leaves, they take the client with them.

The average life of an SMSF, with an accountant, was 7.5 or eight years, in the last data I looked at. Once you’ve got them on the administration side, you’re already a trusted advisor and that sits with the accountant. That is where I do think accountants have a competitive advantage, should they wish to provide that advisory. But some of them don’t want to get into that advice because it puts their relationship at risk if they give advice and it doesn’t go to plan.

### It is interesting how the accountant does have the keys to these superannuation funds?

And that’s been a bit of a holy grail in financial services in Australia, for about the last 10 years. They’ve been trying to figure out how to crack that nut.

### Everyone is trying to get access to it? That is what it seems like when I was doing my research on WHK. Everyone is going through the accountancies, to get access to the $1.7 trillion. Just to be clear, there are a couple of methods you can use to do this? You can follow Stockford, who had the IFAs at the holdco; WHK seem to have the IFAs in the practice; or you have an external relationship with a bigger IFA group, that you don’t then get the benefit of scale and you just get a lead gen fee. So basically, you have to become an IFA?

Yes, exactly. You either have to have an IFA in your office or become an IFA. There was a specific licensing change that meant accountants could create a limited license to do advisory on SMSF investment and it’s amazing how few took it up; I don’t understand that at all.

### As you said, maybe they are just conservative people?

Maybe that is the right answer. I know, in dealing with my own accountant, I want unconflicted advice from them; plain and simple. Maybe I am more common and that is what the accountants are relating to.

### Your accountant deals with yours and you choose the funds and the risk profile?

Yes, and I’ve got a suite of advisors that help me decide on what is going to go into it.

### Is there no online business that is disintermediating this?

Again, all of this is in a state of flux. People are trying so many different ways to crack this nut. HUB24 is a business that is using technology to approach this and to create competitive advantage, distributed through financial advisors, through accountants. They are trying to be that engine, that backbone, and have their own direct offering.

### What is the rough fee that the accountant will charge for the superannuation fund?

Administration for an SMSF is somewhere between 2,000 and 8,000, per annum, depending on the complexity of the fund, for people that do their own investment, of which there is a large number and all they are doing is paying brokerage, for those that are using master funds. But if you are going to go into having it managed by an IFA, anywhere between the fund fee and 25 or 30 basis points.

### How would you approach this? Let’s say you are running a roll up, similar to Kelly, and you want to move into wealth management, what would be your strategy to get hold of this £1.7 trillion?

Overall, I think that larger practices of IFAs and their compliance focus have become much, much better at serving the investing groups and are increasingly non-conflicted. We’ve got quite a stable environment, but the UK seems to do this at scale and Australia still seems to be a relationship-driven cottage industry. That seems to work pretty well.

The manufacturers are now providing wrapper accounts, master funds and other structures to hold it, so there is not a lot of pressure there. I think we’ve reached a bit of a status quo and the accountants appear to be happy getting the administration fees. But there are always people saying, $1.7 trillion, that’s a lot of money.

### As you said, once you have these funds, it’s so sticky for eight to 10 years, and there is little need for innovation. The accountant is happy; they don’t have to do much work and they can get their fee. What we’ve seen in the UK is that, with the online penetration we have across all different services, there is online brokerage now that has just reduced the fees; you can pay £10 a month and you get access to investing your SIPP and ISA.

That is actually really happening here. For the self-directed part, there is big distinction between really doing it yourself, using those much cheaper resources, versus getting advice. That is challenging that advice model.

### St James’s Place is one of the businesses here in the UK that seems to be doing very well. Obviously, it gets the benefit from rolling those funds up and getting the scale benefits. Kelly could do something like that; employ the IFA at the practice level, but how would the incentives work?

Salary plus a bit; it’s the same as the rest of the industry. Salary plus a piece of the trail of the funds under advice.

### There would have to be a cut for the accountant, to get a fee from the IFA?

To be the house. Implicitly, they’re going to get 49% of what the house cut is and Kelly+Partners will get 51% of that cut. If you’ve got a good relationship and a good client dealing team, you become less susceptible to individual IFAs moving and it becomes persistent, recurring income where you make money without working; you make money overnight. When you’re not at work, you’re still making money. It’s a good, attractive annuity income. It’s high quality, if you get that relationship right.

### In Kelly’s model because, as you said, they own half, they would get the benefits of scale, directly?

That’s right. They can do the buying centrally and say, hey, we’ve got X billion dollars of funds under advice.

### I’m just going with this fund or this asset manager?

The partner firms, the operating companies, get a benefit from that, directly.

### This is why I just can’t believe this hasn’t been done before. I guess it’s inertia or culture?

No; I just think, where your largest cost in your business is people, people are unscalable in what you are delivering, the returns go to the people and roll ups are incredibly difficult. Scale ups are incredibly difficult, for pure people businesses.

### What is the one thing you would be looking at? If you could speak to Kelly, for example, what would be your major question that you would be asking?

There are two, that I already mentioned. Firstly, how do they consistently drive scale benefits, within their business? Is their cost change just a one-off jump or can they continue to do that? Secondly, how they are going to drive revenue growth, beyond M&A. I think they’ve got the incentive structures there. Do they have the partner company returns growth? Can they meet the public company growth expectations?
