### Operator:I'm interested in the Swedish serial acquirer space and trying to learn more about that. Bergman & Beving is where it all started, so I'm interested in that. I've gone through your background and can see you've been in the public company arena, leading public companies for a long time.

\[00:06:01\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes.

### \[00:06:02\] Operator:I pretty much know your background, other than being the CEO of Momentum Group, then CEO of Bergman & Beving, and then again CEO of Momentum Alligo. Now, Momentum has spun out again, and you are leading that. Is my understanding correct?

\[00:06:19\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:That's correct.

### \[00:06:21\] Operator:I'm not sure exactly what businesses were there to begin with, what went into Momentum, and what went into Alligo. Can you take me through the whole genealogy, starting from your time at Momentum Group in early 2008-2009, and bring me up to date to today as to what has happened?

\[00:06:50\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:

> In 2001, the Group was split into three separate independent listed companies. Lagercrantz Group took the electronic product companies, Addtech got the technical trade companies, and the new Bergman & Beving focused on tools, workwear clothes, and PPE; more consumable goods for industrial customers in building and construction. That's when they started a franchise chain called Tools, which began in Norway and then expanded to Sweden. These were independent resellers who bought from Bergman & Beving. During that time, Ahlsell was also buying some of Bergman & Beving's customers. So in 2004, the group decided to move forward in the value chain and started buying tools resellers, integrating forward into the value chain. That's when they acquired Momentum Industrial, which is when I joined the business. We were more like a technical trade company, perhaps better suited for Addtech than Bergman & Beving, but we ended up in Bergman & Beving.

Between 2004 and 2008, around 100 acquisitions were carried out to strengthen the group's market position and integrate forward into the value chain. The group built up the Tools chain in Norway, Sweden, and Finland until 2008. Then the Nordic industry suffered a sharp slump.

### \[00:09:11\] Operator:So 100 acquisitions were carried out?

\[00:09:13\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes.

### \[00:09:14\] Operator:Mainly resellers?

\[00:09:16\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:That's correct.

### \[00:09:19\] Operator:Across the Nordic region?

\[00:09:22\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, in Sweden, Norway and Finland.

### \[00:09:25\] Operator:And these 100 acquisitions were completed by 2008, when the financial crisis hit, causing the business to decline significantly. This was all under the leadership of Stefan Wegner?

\[00:09:39\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:

> Yes, that's correct. We recovered a bit, but not very well. The plan during that time, from 2006, was to create a single company and integrate it into something similar to Ahlsell.

### \[00:09:58\] Operator:When did the plan to become a vertically integrated player like Ahlsell start?

\[00:10:07\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:The acquisitions began in 2004, but the plan to be a single company focused on MRO started in 2006. That's when they launched the new strategy.

### \[00:10:21\] Operator:So, around 2006, they started aiming to be first in MRO and began trying to become vertically integrated?

\[00:10:34\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, that's correct.

### \[00:10:36\] Operator:The acquisitions started in 2004, but the articulation of the strategy to become vertically integrated came about in 2006?

\[00:10:45\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, that's correct. They launched the strategy and continued to acquire companies until 2008. Then, when the industry suffered, cost-cutting measures were implemented, but we still pursued the first MRO strategy until I was appointed as CEO.

### \[00:11:14\] Operator:How did your move from Momentum Group to CEO of Bergman & Beving come about? Since Momentum Group was part of Bergman & Beving, it was essentially a promotion for you, right?

\[00:11:26\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, that's correct. What happened was that Anders Börjesson, one of the owners and deputy chairman, became the chairman of the board in the summer of 2012. At a general meeting, he decided it was time for a change and interviewed me, asking for my opinions on what was good and not so good. I shared my thoughts and what I would do if appointed, and then they hired me.

### \[00:12:11\] Operator:As CEO of Bergman & Beving, you had a large business with product companies, wholesalers, and resellers. You had acquired around 100 resellers, including the Tools chain. Can you discuss what happened and how you approached this until 2017, when the spin-off occurred?

\[00:12:43\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:I implemented a decentralized responsibility model, treating the organization as multiple companies instead of just one. We had nine major companies, and I told them they needed to develop independently without relying on the Tools chain as a tools reseller. I also reintroduced the profit-through-working-capital model, which is a simplified measure for cash flow. In a way, I went back to the roots of Bergman & Beving, which I was introduced to when we were acquired in 2004.

Over three years, we worked on improving our balance sheet and P&L. We sold off many properties to pay off debts and focused on profit working capital to achieve better cash flow and P&L statements. After three years, I discussed with Anders Börjesson, the idea of not being in the value chain as one company. I suggested a spin-off, similar to what we did in 2001. He agreed, and we began planning the separation.

We had a discussion about where to split. Should Bergman & Beving be the product company and the wholesaling, which they were in 2001 or should the wholesaler be with the resellers? We ultimately decided that the wholesaling and product companies would remain as Bergman & Beving, while the resellers would become Momentum Group.

### \[00:15:22\] Operator:So, when Momentum Group was spun off from Bergman & Beving, it was mainly comprised of resellers, which are essentially retail-level businesses in the construction industry?

\[00:15:22\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:

> Yes, that's correct. Only resellers. The new Bergman & Beving returned to a structure similar to 2001, but with some acquisitions and new own brands launched during that time, such as ESSVE and Teng Tools.

### \[00:16:18\] Operator:And then Momentum Group acquired Swedol?

\[00:16:23\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:At that time, we had resellers in two different areas within Momentum Group. One area was technical trade, mainly spare parts for machines, and the other was industrial supplies, tools, and workwear clothes for equipping people in the workplace. We decided to build a Nordic organization for the Tools chain, as we couldn't have economy and category management in three countries. It's more of a slim business that requires streamlining.

We needed a single ERP system, better logistics, and some of our own product brands. We looked into a strategy and started building, which led us to Swedol. They had some of the building blocks we needed, like their own product brands after acquiring Grolls. They also built a large warehouse in Örebro, and a common ERP system called Jeeves. We thought it would be a perfect match, and then we could make the next spin-off in the product dimension.

### \[00:18:25\] Operator:Was separating the machine part from the human protective wear always part of the equation when you decided to acquire Swedol, or did that plan form later?

\[00:18:42\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:

> That was actually the plan. The CEO of Swedol, a publicly listed company, needed a plan for the next steps if he wanted to stay. We had a decision to make a new spin-off at that time to motivate the merger with Swedol.

### \[00:19:09\] Operator:So you decided to merge Swedol and then spin off the new Momentum Group at the same time?

\[00:19:16\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, but we had many integration projects, so it was also a matter of timing. We needed to come out as two independent, well-functioning companies on Nasdaq.

### \[00:19:48\] Operator:Then the new Alligo management handled the integration of tools and Swedol?

\[00:19:54\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes.

### \[00:19:55\] Operator:So essentially, you divided the existing Momentum Group into two parts, with Swedol acquiring the tools part and the machine part becoming an independent entity?

\[00:20:17\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Initially, we thought of spinning off Alligo, but they had many integration projects that might take longer. We decided it would be better to spin off Momentum again since we were a smaller entity, allowing them to focus on their integration projects.

### \[00:20:47\] Operator:And now you run the Momentum Group, which was spun off.

\[00:20:52\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, that's correct. I went from 10 billion, the first spin-off, to four and a half. Then we built that up to 10 billion in turnover, 10 billion SEK. And then, at the latest spin-off, I took one and a half billion and Alligo became eight and a half. So that's the story.

### \[00:21:17\] Operator:Regarding the Bergman & Beving side, I saw the presentation you gave around the time of the spin where Pontus talked about the fragmented supplier base and customer base for the wholesaler. Can you explain the value chain, the competitive landscape, and what's been happening there?

\[00:21:46\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:If you have what we call product companies, they have their own brands. They can sell their brands through a wholesaler or directly to resellers or end customers.

The wholesaler bundles other brands and replaces tail suppliers for customers, making it more cost-efficient for resellers than buying from 200 different suppliers. That's the landscape and difference between the product company and wholesaler environment.

### \[00:22:42\] Operator:Explain the wholesaler part again. So, product companies need a certain scale to supply customers directly. If they are small, they go through a wholesaler, and the wholesaler can bundle the tail of that supply to a large customer.

\[00:22:57\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:It depends. The product company can supply directly to Alligo because they have a central warehouse, or they can supply directly to Swedol because they have a central warehouse.

### \[00:23:13\] Operator:So, Alligo is just a reseller, not a wholesaler?

\[00:23:18\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:No, just a reseller.

### \[00:23:20\] Operator:Yes.

\[00:23:20\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Product companies like ESSVE supply chains like Bauhaus, Alligo, and Ahlsell.

### \[00:23:34\] Operator:Ahlsell is both a wholesaler and a reseller.

\[00:23:39\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Most of their business is as a reseller. They're more head-to-head with Alligo.

### \[00:23:49\] Operator:So, ESSVE, which is a big enough company, supplies directly to Alligo or Ahlsell but not directly to end customers.

\[00:24:01\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:No, they don't.

### \[00:24:03\] Operator:ESSVE is one of the bigger suppliers, right? They seem to have a decent market share in their area.

\[00:24:09\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, they're good.

### \[00:24:13\] Operator:What's the role of the wholesaler? It feels like you're saying that the role of the wholesaler has become smaller and smaller.

\[00:24:22\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:

> A wholesaler's function is primarily to supply. For instance, a product company may not have the capability to serve Alligo due to logistical constraints. In this case, a wholesaler can act as an intermediary, bundling various brands and products to supply to Ahlsell. They are more likely to supply the tail of products. If we conduct an 80-20 analysis, perhaps 90% of the volume to Ahlsell and Alligo comes from product companies, and the tail of products comes from a wholesaler. The wholesaler's role is to bundle numerous suppliers and products in a cost-efficient manner.

### \[00:25:29\] Operator:So, the tail or the last 10% consists of probably hundreds of brands that come through a wholesaler.

\[00:25:36\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes.

### \[00:25:39\] Operator:Initially, it seems like the wholesaler's role was more significant, perhaps supplying 30%, 40%, or 50% of what the reseller was selling. Over time, that has decreased to 10%.

\[00:25:56\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:

> As more independent resellers, like Alligo, develop central warehouses, they can purchase directly from product companies without relying on wholesalers for logistics. Wholesalers are primarily responsible for logistics.

### \[00:26:34\] Operator:So, wholesalers provide capital and logistics.

\[00:26:36\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes.

### \[00:26:38\] Operator:Wholesalers supply capital and logistics. Resellers like Alligo and Ahlsell can now develop their logistics using the 80-20 principle, building 20% of the logistic capability that deals with 80% of the volume.

\[00:26:58\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Exactly. They can then buy directly from producers like ESSVE.

### \[00:27:05\] Operator:The wholesaler's business is under pressure as resellers move into the wholesaler's area, and product companies aim to shorten the supply chain. The chain is becoming shorter, as one would expect.

\[00:27:31\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:

> The landscape has changed as fragmented reseller functions have consolidated in both the industrial and building construction sectors. Due to this consolidation, chains like Bauhaus, Alligo, and Ahlsell have developed their central warehouses, squeezing the wholesaler function and turning them into more of a tail supplier.

### \[00:28:09\] Operator:To clarify, the biggest reseller chains are Bauhaus, Hornbach, Alligo, and Ahlsell, correct?

\[00:28:23\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:In Finland, there's Etra, another reseller, and Würth, which mostly has its own brands. In Norway, there's TESS. The competitive landscape consists of different chains that have consolidated more and more in each country. There are still some independent resellers, but not many.

### \[00:29:09\] Operator:Do you have any idea how large the independent resellers' market share is in Sweden, Norway, and Finland combined?

\[00:29:22\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:I'm not certain. but I wouldn't dare to say for sure. I do believe that the chains are taking the majority of the turnover because they're getting so large.

### \[00:29:48\] Operator:So you're saying chains have more than 50% market share?

\[00:29:51\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, definitely more than 50%.

### \[00:29:54\] Operator:But you're not sure if it's 80% or 90%?

\[00:29:56\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:No, I'm not sure. My educated guess would be around 70%.

### \[00:30:06\] Operator:If there are 20% to 30% independent resellers, would they be buying from wholesalers or from some of these bigger chains as well?

\[00:30:18\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:

> It depends on the logistics setup for the independent resellers. Sometimes the wholesaler functions as their central warehouse, allowing them to bundle five different brands and send one package directly to the end customer. The need for wholesalers has diminished due to the competitive landscape and consolidation of resellers since 2004.

### \[00:30:53\] Operator:So the resellers' warehouses can also serve as wholesalers for some independent reseller shops?

\[00:31:01\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes.

### \[00:31:02\] Operator:So it's not like independents are only buying from wholesalers. They can also buy from resellers if they offer cheaper products and better service, regardless of competition?

\[00:31:26\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, exactly.

### \[00:31:29\] Operator:Who are the biggest wholesalers?

\[00:31:45\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:For wholesalers, I would say it's Luna and Thomee.

### \[00:32:06\] Operator:Thomee is owned by Volati, right?

\[00:32:09\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, Thomee is also a wholesaler. So Luna and Thomee are the main wholesalers.

### \[00:32:19\] Operator:Are there any others?

\[00:32:22\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Not that I know of, to be honest.

### \[00:32:25\] Operator:What do you think the end game for these wholesalers is then? From what we know speaking to Bergman & Beving, etc., these wholesalers are not doing very well.

\[00:32:39\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:

> The wholesaler is a kind of logistic function, which means their gross margin is low and their cost of sales has to be low as well. If I look at the wholesaling function, it's around a 3% to 5% profit margin.

### \[00:33:07\] Operator:EBIT margin?

\[00:33:08\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, that means you can have a gross margin around 30 to 25 something, and then you have to have a low cost of sales. But I think that is what they're changing now, in Bergman & Beving. They're phasing out products that don't make money and acquiring new companies with their own products.

### \[00:33:33\] Operator:Do you think it makes sense to just shut the business down?

\[00:33:37\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Shut it down?

### \[00:33:39\] Operator:Yes.

\[00:33:40\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:No.

### \[00:33:42\] Operator:Does it take a lot of capital investment?

\[00:33:45\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:No, it does not. Some of the wholesaling products, for example, need a wholesaler to serve customers in the Nordic because it's too much capex investment to build a warehouse and logistics. But what I have read is that they're changing the wholesaling businesses, phasing out more wholesale, and acquiring more product companies into Luna. So I think they're changing Luna to become a more product company as well, with daughter companies.

### \[00:34:42\] Operator:You mean at Bergman & Beving?

\[00:34:44\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, Bergman & Beving in that division.

### \[00:34:46\] Operator:In general, does the wholesale business take a lot of capital investment, or can you sort of take the EBIT and that turns reasonably well?

\[00:34:57\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:No, it's not much capital investment. It's mainly IT and logistics.

### \[00:35:10\] Operator:Logistics is mainly third party, right? They don't have their own trucks and stuff like that?

\[00:35:18\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:I think they moved it back to their own new warehouse they have built. I believe Luna is moving back to that internal logistics setup.

### \[00:35:43\] Operator:Do they own their own trucks, etc.?

\[00:35:47\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Bergman & Beving has their own logistics company, which they own. They have two warehouses, one newly built, and they also have an automated logistics setup. That's where they will move Luna. One of the reasons to outsource the Luna logistics was to reduce the logistic cost of sales.

### \[00:36:17\] Operator:Do you think they can achieve lower costs by having logistics in-house?

\[00:36:21\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:I think they can, and improve quality. It's not just Luna, but also the other product companies. All the Bergman & Beving companies can use the warehouse. So they have a kind of internal third-party logistics, I would say.

### \[00:36:49\] Operator:I'm curious about how that plays with the decentralized model.

\[00:36:54\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:The decentralization allows them to choose if they want to be part of the internal logistics setup.

### \[00:37:06\] Operator:So, the setup needs to be competitive in terms of pricing.

\[00:37:10\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, Luna moved back due to quality and some cost issues as well.

### \[00:37:22\] Operator:What do you think of the strategy to have more products? Does it make sense? Do the types of products that Bergman & Beving have command any customer attention, desire, or pricing power?

\[00:37:43\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:

> When the spinoff happened in 2001, Lagercrantz Group got the electronics, which was a low-margin business. They changed that by phasing out unprofitable products and acquiring companies with their own brands and higher margins. I think Bergman & Beving is now running the same strategy as Lagercrantz did in 2001. That strategy can work because after the split, they were supposed to build up brands that were number one or number two in the market and acquire companies that are hard and expensive to build. So, I think they're copying Lagercrantz's strategy from 2001.

### \[00:38:49\] Operator:Why might that not work?

\[00:38:53\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:I believe it will work; it's just a different strategy.

### \[00:38:59\] Operator:What are the risks if it doesn't work? Why might it not work?

\[00:39:02\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:It will work, but it will take time because they need to find the right companies. They have been making acquisitions frequently, so I think they're on the right track. They will buy companies with their own products and higher margins, phase out lower-margin products, and reduce the wholesale business, which is weakening as well.

### \[00:39:46\] Operator:If it doesn't work, where could it go wrong?

\[00:39:59\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:

> What could go wrong is if they acquire the wrong companies. The strategy is simple, and they have proven it with Lagercrantz, which has been tremendously successful.

### \[00:40:20\] Operator:What would be the wrong kind of companies to acquire?

\[00:40:23\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:

> If they buy a profitable company and then lose management or something else, making it unprofitable. The key is people management, making new companies feel welcome, and enabling organic growth. It's more about managing the acquisitions and developing them.

### \[00:41:01\] Operator:Are there many other brand companies that Bergman & Beving can acquire?

\[00:41:11\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:If you look at Bergman & Beving and Hultafors Group, it's quite interesting. That would be a good combination. It's a large business, but I think it would be a good match with Bergman & Beving.

### \[00:41:31\] Operator:Are there many small, well-branded product companies that they can acquire? That's their strategy, right?

\[00:41:39\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, there are a lot of them in their scope, so I don't think the population is too small for this strategy to succeed.

### \[00:41:56\] Operator:There is quite a lot of competition to buy those companies as well. There are several serial acquirers looking at similar areas.

\[00:42:05\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, there is competition. But they have proven that they have started their acquisition strategy. They have made some acquisitions, and if they can make three to five acquisitions every year, they'll be within their scope of being a serial acquirer.

### \[00:42:26\] Operator:Can you talk a little about what happened after Momentum Group split out and when Pontus was running Bergman & Beving?

\[00:42:46\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:After the split, Pontus outsourced Luna logistics and upgraded ERP systems in some companies. He started looking to buy product companies with good brands, who were maybe number one, two, or three in the market. It was difficult for him to buy them because of the high multiples. I know I looked at Grolls when I was the CEO, and I wanted to buy it, but Swedol bought it at a multiple of 10 or 12. He wasn't able to really get the acquisitions going, maybe due to the high multiple. Acquiring big brands or top brands comes with higher multiples, which might have been a constraint for him. I don't think the strategy was wrong. It is different if you look at a serial acquirer. Everyone says that you buy between five and seven times. If you look at a valuable brand, you are normally up at 10; that is my experience. They are maybe higher multiples than the management board are used to.

### \[00:44:57\] Operator:What do you think will be the difference between Pontus trying to do it and Magnus trying to do it? The multiples you have to pay for the business are still high.

\[00:45:13\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:

> Magnus has a different strategy. He's not focused on building brands that could be number one, two, or three in the market. He has a broader strategy, looking at different product verticals and countries. The multiples for these acquisitions are more like five or seven because they're not top brands in one or two countries. Pontus wanted to build more ESSVE brands, aiming to be number one or number two.

### \[00:46:06\] Operator:It doesn't seem like ESSVE has maintained impressive margins and returns.

\[00:46:13\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:They were before, but they have gone down a little bit lately this year. During the period of time when we were split, ESSVE was the star business.

### \[00:46:35\] Operator:This is all very helpful. Speaking more broadly about the Swedish serial acquirer landscape, which you know very well, who would you say are the most respected acquirers in the market?

\[00:47:02\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:

> I think all of them are respected, but they are different. If you look at Addtech, they focus on technical trade and are primarily Nordic, but they have also expanded outside the Nordic region and entered new market segments like energy. Then you have Lagercrantz, which has a more diverse acquisition strategy, targeting companies with their own products and high margins. Indutrade is another large company that focuses more on valves and other related products. Then there's Storskogen, which has a wider acquisition strategy and has been written about extensively. And then, of course, there are private companies that are also serial acquirers. It's maybe a bit of a Nordic or Swedish phenomenon.

### \[00:48:25\] Operator:Do you think all of these serial acquirers are leading to more competition for acquisitions and higher prices for targets in the market?

\[00:48:34\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:

> No, not really, to be honest. I think all of us know that the multiple strategies and buying too expensive don't yield any significant earnings per share (EPS) growth. So I don't think it drives the multiples, actually.

### \[00:49:21\] Operator:To learn more about the Swedish serial acquirer landscape or Bergman & Beving specifically, are there any resources, books, or journals you'd recommend?

\[00:49:41\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:I'm not aware of any specific resources, but I suggest reading the annual statements to understand their acquisition strategies, sweet spots for acquisitions, how wide are they in their scope of product dimensions, sectors, and geographic focus.

### \[00:50:20\] Operator:What is the sweet spot for acquisitions for today's Bergman & Beving, in your view?

\[00:50:29\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:To be honest, I don't really know. I think they're following a Lagercrantz strategy, which is quite broad. As long as the companies have their own product brands and high margins, they can be integrated into Bergman & Beving without diluting the profit margin. Over time, they can phase out nonprofit products and maybe some of the wholesaling business. So I would say their strategy is quite wide.

### \[00:51:41\] Operator:Could I go back to the period before the Momentum spin-off for Bergman & Beving? Could you describe the shareholder group and governance situation? How has that developed across the different groups? How does that work?

\[00:52:03\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:When I joined in 2012, CapMan had become the largest shareholder in Bergman & Beving and also had a chair on the board. At that time, CapMan had bought into the company for the first MRO project. When we didn't go that way, which the rest of the board may not have thought of, CapMan sold their shares. During that period, you had Anders Börjesson and Tomas Hedelius, who still have the A shares in Bergman & Beving.

### \[00:52:47\] Operator:Who owns the A shares in Bergman & Beving?

\[00:52:57\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Anders Börjesson and Tomas Hedelius. So I think what has changed in the owner base is that CapMan left during that period. And then, of course, you have SEB, Handelsbanken, and other institutions. Every spin-off changes the owner base because, of course, two different companies come out of it.

### \[00:53:31\] Operator:So now for Bergman & Beving, it's mostly Börjesson and family.

\[00:53:37\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, in A shares, of course. But I know that Tomas Hedelius still has his A shares, and I know Anders Börjesson has bought a lot of B shares as well. I think he is the biggest owner in both companies right now.

### \[00:53:54\] Operator:Do you think they fully support the decentralized and M&A strategy?

\[00:54:00\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, because Anders Börjesson was the CEO of Bergman & Beving for 11 years, and then Wagner took over for 10 or 11 years. Börjesson was also on the board. He is a strong advocate for decentralization, profit, and working capital. He is also a big owner in Addtech and Lagercrantz.

### \[00:54:23\] Operator:Okay, what about the Hedelius family? Are they big owners of Alligo now?

\[00:54:28\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:They own shares in all of the companies that have been spun off. They have around 500,000 A shares in each company; in Bergman & Beving, Momentum Group, Alligo, AddLife, Addtech, and Lagercrantz.

### \[00:54:56\] Operator:That does not sound like a whole lot.

\[00:55:00\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:No, but it's A shares, so it's 10 votes per A share instead of one vote. That's why they are important.

### \[00:55:11\] Operator:Are they in Momentum Group as well?

\[00:55:14\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, Tomas Hedelius has kept his A shares in all companies. However, he has sold his shares in AddLife, Momentum Group, and Alligo because he was not the owner.

### \[00:55:36\] Operator:He has sold his shares in the old Momentum Group, now Alligo.

\[00:55:41\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, and AddLife. So he's the owner of the traditional Bergman & Beving, which spun off Addtech, Bergman & Beving, and Lagercrantz in 2001.

### \[00:55:58\] Operator:What is their philosophy? Are they more inclined to support more integration?

\[00:56:06\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:No, it's completely decentralized. There's no integration at all. Anders Börjesson is the person I'm talking about, and he's also pro-decentralization. Tom Hedelius is also for decentralization and was the CEO of Handelsbanken for many years, and decentralization was a big thing for him as well. Both of them are very keen on decentralization.

### \[00:56:40\] Operator:Okay, so Tom Hedelius was CEO of Handelsbanken after Jan Wallander.

\[00:56:43\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, something like that.

### \[00:56:58\] Operator:Is there anything else I should have asked you that I haven't?

\[00:57:05\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:No. I think Bergman & Beving struggled a bit after the first spin-off because they didn't really get the acquisition of product companies. But now, I think they have widened their scope in that strategy, and it's running more smoothly. It's the Lagercrantz strategy, which was very successful. So I think that could work for Bergman & Beving as well.

### \[00:57:35\] Operator:And just broadly, how do you think about the cyclicality of the whole market? When you speak to these guys, they say that their market is not very cyclical, even though they all serve construction and industrial markets. That's a bit hard to understand.

\[00:57:54\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, of course it's cyclical. During the downturn in 2008, the tools and products companies were hit harder than Momentum Industrial, which provides spare parts for the industry. So, it's definitely cyclical. They're also dependent on the building, construction, and industrial sectors. It's somewhat cyclical in terms of weather as well. Although they may not admit it, a cold or mild winter affects the selling of winter clothes, for example.

### \[00:58:44\] Operator:On the tool side?

\[00:58:45\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, on the tool side, like protective wear.

### \[00:59:34\] Operator:You mentioned that these resellers are moving into wholesaler territory by building warehouses and improving their logistic capabilities. Resellers have their own brands, and wholesalers have their own brands as well. Does having their own brands help a wholesaler in any way?

\[01:00:04\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:If it's a brand that is perceived as good quality at an affordable price, yes. But otherwise, not really, because it ties up a lot of working capital.

### \[01:00:23\] Operator:Does it tie up a lot of working capital for the wholesaler or the reseller?

\[01:00:27\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:For the wholesaler, if they have their own product brands. Of course, you produce them in the Middle East, and then you have to ship them for six weeks on a container, and then you have them in your stock. So it ties up capital. It's not necessarily that the wholesaler needs to have their own brands.

### \[01:00:53\] Operator:For a reseller, the situation is slightly different because they can sell at a higher margin to the end customer.

\[01:00:59\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Yes, exactly.

### \[01:01:02\] Operator:So having their own brands helps the reseller, but it's not necessarily very helpful for the wholesaler.

\[01:01:08\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:That's correct.

### \[01:01:15\] Operator:For resellers, it can help because they have the customer relationship. Why is it helpful for the reseller?

\[01:01:23\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Because they can have a higher margin and they also have their own brands, which link them to their company. So if the customer doesn't want to change brands, that's the only selling point they can get it from. In a way, they're brick walling their customers if they have a good own brand.

### \[01:01:47\] Operator:So if a customer gets used to your own brand product, they don't usually want to switch quickly. Is it very hard in the first place to get the customer hooked onto your brand?

\[01:02:07\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:I wouldn't say so. If you have a good product, good quality, at an affordable price, and the customer likes it, they'll stick to it.

### \[01:02:19\] Operator:Are there any products or brands in that area that you would say are really strong brands which every reseller has to have, where the customer asks for the brand by name?

\[01:02:38\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:In the power tools, Milwaukee is a preferable brand today, for example.

### \[01:02:47\] Operator:Any others?

\[01:02:53\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:You have a couple of different brands in work clothes and protective gear. Of course, you have Fristads, and you have Hultafors, which has Meterstock, for example.

### \[01:03:14\] Operator:I was reading and thought there was still a fair amount of manufacturing of this kind of stuff in the Nordics. Is that impression right or wrong?

\[01:03:26\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Manufacturing of what?

### \[01:03:28\] Operator:Manufacturing of protective clothes, shoes, and equipment.

\[01:03:32\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:You have companies like Arbesko producing some, but most of the products are actually produced in the Middle East, Taiwan, and China.

### \[01:03:48\] Operator:I thought it doesn't feel like there is enough money here to produce them in the Nordics.

\[01:03:55\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Some of them are. I think Meterstock in Hultafors is produced in Sweden. Some of the Arbesko shoes are produced in Sweden as well.

### \[01:04:07\] Operator:Do they command enough of a price premium to be able to do that and make a good margin?

\[01:04:14\] Former Executive Officer at Bergman & Beving:Price premium or it has to be very automated production processes.

### \[01:04:21\] Operator:Thank you so much. I really appreciate your time.
