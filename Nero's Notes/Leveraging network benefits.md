Leveraging network benefits, such as a larger or more comprehensive distribution network, is another common characteristic of successful acquisitions. 

One excellent example is Diageo, the consumer goods company with a portfolio of world-famous beverages.  Often, Diageo's acquisitions not only add good but under-penetrated brands to the global portfolio (such as Zapaca rum, now part of its reserve line), they also improve distribution into new markets for existing brands. Recently acquired brands from deals such as Mey Icki (Turkey) or Ypioca (Brazil) are now sold elsewhere and, more importantly, Diageo's existing brands are selling better in both those countries.
