The structure of a company's industry is essential to its potential as a quality investment. Competitors will always take toil to take away any excess return a business is earning. Knowing the competition and understanding how it behaves is therefore vital to assessing the durability of a competitive advantage. Perhaps more crucially, over time some industries lend themselves to sustainable high returns for all players, even amid competition. 

These are situations where the overall industry and market structure neutralizes some of the usual constraints of economic theory. Good examples occur amid mini and partial monopolies.
