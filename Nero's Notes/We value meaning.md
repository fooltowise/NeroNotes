We don't value things; we value their meaning. What they are is determined by the laws of physics, but what they mean is determined by the laws of psychology.

Advertising often works in this way: a great deal of the effectiveness of advertising derives from its power to direct attention to favourable aspects of an experience, in order to change the experience for the better. 

**Never forget this: the nature of our attention affects the nature of our experience.**
