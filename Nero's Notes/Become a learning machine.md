To compound wisdom, you need to value your time very highly. You've got to keep control of your time, and you can't unless you say no. You can't let people set your agenda in life. (see [[Opportunity costs]] )

Reading alone is not enough to improve your knowledge (see [[Your mind as a library]]). Learning something insightful requires work. You have to read something *above* your current level. You need to find writers who are more knowledgeable on a particular subject than yourself. This is how you become more intelligent. **Hang out and interact with people better than you and you cannot help but improve.**
