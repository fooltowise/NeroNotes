# Four Types of Self-Deception

There are four main types of [[self deception]]:
  - The madman: publicly committing to something no matter what (ex: chicken game): When we commit ourselves to a particular course of action, it changes the incentives for other players
  - The loyalist: "Sure, I'll go along with your beliefs" => demonstrating commitment and hoping to earn trust in return.
  - The Cheerleader: The more fervently we believe something, the more it is easier to convince others (ex. CEO)
  - The Cheater: "I don't know what you're talking about, my motives were pure..." => When we deceive ourselves about our own motives, it is more difficult for others to prosecute our minor [[norms]] transgressions.
