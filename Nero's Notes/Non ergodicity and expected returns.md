Maximizing the expected returns of your choices is a good strategy only if the consequences of mistakes and misfortunes are reversible. Otherwise, it is a stupid strategy.  What is optimal in the presence of reversibility is stupid otherwise, and the other way around. 

In life in general, it is not the best ones who succeed. **It is the best ones of those who survive.** Performance is subordinate to survival.

In any repeated non-ergodic activity, **irreversibility absorbs future gains.** 
A single negative event can render short-term maximization irrelevant.
