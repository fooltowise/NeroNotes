# The Friendly Middleman

Many businesses must deal with middlemen to reach end consumers. The middleman's role can be positive or negative on a company's growth, margins and returns. In trying to understand the varying roles and results, we have identified several useful patterns, pivoting around what we call *the friendly middleman*.

### The Helping Hand
Among a company's more valuable middlemen are those that bundle delivery of the company's product with their own expert services. In one such type of bundling, the middleman is both a salesman and an expert, say a dentist recommending an implant or even a brand of toothpaste.

Or take an optometrist, who administers an eye test and prescribes glasses. Customers naturally ask for the optometrist's professional advice on the choice of lens and style. Unlike a salesperson at an electronics store, people are inclined to trust the optometrist despite the fact that he is also a salesman (see [[Agency Business Model]]). Clientele are called patients, not customers. As a matter of professional training and reputational interest, the optometrist's goal is to deliver you a pair of lenses that fit your needs and make you happy.
As a matter of economics, the optometrist's goal is to maximize dollar margin by selling the most expensive pair of glasses that meet those professional criteria. Patient interests are often aligned - high quality is paramount and premium pricing is acceptable given the setting. (If a cheap pair of reading glasses would do, the scene would be a discount pharmacy where a customer plunks $20 for a 1.5 magnification). Thus a lens maker, Essilor, is in an attractive business position, benefiting from a professional expert whose incentives are to sell high-priced products that serve patient needs.
A second example of bundled delivery involves customer paying for the professional installation of manufactured products, for example by electrical or plumbing contractors. Customers tend to focus on the provider's hourly rate and minimize that rather than inspect brand offerings and haggle over those prices. Product safety and reliability, not cost, are paramount.
The craftman's goal are not necessarily aligned with those of the customer: besides safety and reliability - after all , he will be blamed for failure - and perhaps ease of installation, his focus will not be price, except to the extent of helping his own margins, which will point towards the pricier end. The manufacturer is again in an attractive position: **an expert chooses the product, while another persons pays the bill.**
