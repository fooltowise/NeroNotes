# Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance


One of the favorite books of [[Lessons from Nick Sleep and Qais Zakaria| Nick Sleep]]



### Summary of Quality:

There are two ways of experiencing a motorcycle:  
1. Romantically—riding a cycle down a mountain road, invigorated by the wind rushing past  
2. Classically—familiarizing yourself with the working parts of the machine, developing a feel for how tight to secure the bolts.  This is a system-thinking approach.
  
Romantic experience is “in the moment.”  
  
Classical experience connects the past to the future, allowing us to build on previous knowledge:  
1. Systems of Components and Functions—physical working parts which we come to know either:  
	a. Empirically—knowledge gained by the senses  
	b. a priori—knowledge gained intuitively (known without prior experience)  
2. Concepts—Ideas with the potential to be realized (the thought precedes the creation of the physical object).  
	a. Inductive ideas start with observing specific examples and end with a general conclusion.  
	b. Deductive ideas start with general knowledge used to predict specific observations.  
Connecting the Romantic to the Classical is Quality. To care about something will increase its quality.  
  
Pirsig creates an analogy comparing knowledge to a railroad train that is always going somewhere:  
- Classic Knowledge is the engine and the cars.  
- Romantic reality adds the dimension of time—it is the cutting edge of the experience, the moment in time.  
- Traditional knowledge is the body of classic knowledge plus the history of where the train has been.  
- Quality is the track—the “preintellectual reality” or “the moment of vision before the intellectualization takes place”. What carries the train forward is a sense of what is good. It is understood intuitively and enhanced by skill and experience.  
- If your train gets stuck, understand two things:  
	-  Being stuck eventually produces real understanding as you look for the solution in your train of knowledge. (A classical experience)
	-  Don’t be afraid to stop and analyze—you can see in patterns not only the physical object but the idea or function of the object. Eventually you will be able to break through barriers.




### Some quotes:
- *The mechanics in their attitude toward the machine were really taking no different attitude from the manual's toward the machine, or from the attitude I had when I brought it in there. We were all spectators. And it occurred to me there is no manual that deals with the real business of motorcycle maintenance, the most important aspect of all. **Caring about what you are doing is considered either unimportant or taken for granted.** *

- I don't want to hurry it. That itself is a poisonous twentieth-century attitude. **When you want to hurry something, that means you no longer care about it and want to get on to other things. **

- To live for some future goal is shallow. It's the sides of the mountain that sustains life, not the top. Here's where things grow. But of course, without the top you cannot have any side. It's the top that defines the sides.


- To put it in more concrete terms: If you want to build a factory, or fix a motorcycle, or set a nation right without getting stuck, then classical, structured, dualistic subject-object knowledge, although necessary, isn't enough. You have to have some feeling for the quality of the work. You have to have a sense of what's good. *That* is what carries you forward. This sense isn't just something you're born with, although you *are* born with it. It's also something you can develop. It's not just "intuition", not just unexplainable "skill" or "talent". It's the direct result of contact with basic *reality*, Quality, which dualistic reason has in the past tended to conceal.

- I talked about caring the first day and then realized I couldn't say anything meaningful about caring until its inverse side, Quality, is understood. I think it's important now to tie care to Quality by pointing out that care and Quality aare internal and external aspects of the same thing. A person who sees Quality and feels it as he works is a person who cares. A person who cares about what he sees and does is a person who's bound to have some characteristics of Quality.

- Stuckness shouldn't be avoided. It’s the psychic predecessor of all real understanding. An egoless acceptance of stuckness is a key to an understanding of all Quality, in mechanical work as in other endeavors. It’s this understanding of Quality as revealed by stuckness which so often makes self-taught mechanics so superior to institute-trained men who have learned how to handle everything except a new situation.


- The real machine you're working on is a cycle called yourself. The machine that appears to be "out there" and the person that appears to be "in there" are not two separate things. They grow toward Quality or fall away from Quality together.

### Best extract:
Peace of mind isn't at all superficial to technical work. It's the whole thing. That which produces it is good work and that which destroys it is bad work. The specs, the measuring instruments, the quality control, the final check-out, these are all means toward the end of satisfying the peace of mind of those responsible for the work. What really counts in the end is their peace of mind, nothing else. The reason for this is that peace of mind is a prerequisite for a perception of that Quality  which is beyond Romantic Quality and classic Quality and which unites the two, and which must accompany the work as it proceeds. The way to see what looks good and understand the reasons it looks good and to be at one with this goodness as the work proceeds, is to cultivate an inner quietness, a peace of mind so that goodness can shine through.

I say *inner* peace of mind. It has no direct relationship to external circumstances. it can occur to a monk in meditation, to a soldier in heavy combat or to a machinist taking off that last ten-thousandth of an inch. It involves un-self-consciousness, ant here are levels and levels of this identification and levels and levels of quietness quite as profound and difficult of attainment as the more familiar levels of activity. The mountains of achievement are Quality discovered in one direction only, and are relatively meaningless and often unobtainable unless taken together with the ocean trenches of self-awareness - so different from self-consciousness - which result form inner peace of mind.

The inner peace of mind occurs on three levels of understanding. Physical quietness seems the easiest to achieve, although there are levels and levels of this too, as attested by the ability of Hindu mystics to live buried alive for many days. Mental quietness, in which one has no wandering thoughts at all, seems more difficult, but can be achieved. But value quietness, in which one has no wandering desires at all but simply performs the acts of his life without desire, that seems the hardest.

I've sometimes thought this inner peace of mind, this quietness is similar to if not identical with the sort of calm you sometimes get when going fishing, which accounts for much of popularity of this sport. Just to sit with the line in the water, not moving, not really thinking about anything, not really caring about anything either, seems to draw out the inner tensions and frustrations that have prevented you from solving problems you couldn't solve before and introduced ugliness and clumsiness into your actions and thoughts.

You don't have to go fishing, of course, to fix your motorcycle. A cup of coffee, a walk around the block, sometimes just putting off the job for five minutes of silence is enough. When you do you can almost feel yourself grow toward that inner peace of mind that reveals it all. That which turns its back on this inner calm and the Quality it reveals is bad maintenance. That which turns toward it is good. The forms of turning away and toward are infinite but the goal is always the same.

I think that when this concept of peace of mind is introduced and made central to the act of technical work, a fusion of classic and romantic quality can take place at a basic level within a practical working context. I've said  you can actually see this fusion in skilled mechanics and machinists of a certain sort, and you can see it in the work they do. To say that they are not artists is to misunderstand the nature of art. They have patience, care and attentiveness to what they're doing, but more than this - there's a kind of inner peace of mind that isn't contrived but results from a kind of harmony with the work in which there's no leader and no follower. (Looks a lot like [[Engagement - Flow]]). The material and the craftsman's thoughts change together in a progression of smooth, even changes until his mind is at rest at the exact instant the material is right.

We've all had moments of that sort when we're doing something we really ant to do. it's just that somehow we've gotten into an unfortunate separation of those moments from work. The mechanic I'm talking about doesn't make this separation. One says of him that he is "interested" in what he is doing, that he's "involved" in his work. What produces this involvement is, at the cutting edge of consciousness, an absence of any sense of separateness of subject and object. "Being with it", "being a natural", "taking hold" - there are a lot of idiomatic expressions for what I mean by this absence of subject-object duality, because what I mean is so well understood as folklore, common sense, the everyday understanding of the shop. But in scientific parlance the words for this absence of subject-object duality are scarce because scientific minds have shut themselves off from consciousness of this kind of understanding in the assumption of the formal dualistic scientific method.

Zen Buddhists talk about "just sitting", a meditative practice in which the idea of a duality of self and object does not dominate one's consciousness. What I'm talking about  here in motorcycle maintenance is "just fixing", in which the idea of a duality of self and object doesn't dominate one's consciousness. When one isn't dominated by feelings of separateness from what he's working on, then one can be said to "care" about what he's doing. that is what caring really is, a feeling of identification with what one's doing. When one has this feeling then he also sees the inverse side of caring, Quality itself.

So the thing to do when working on a motorcycle, as in any other task, is to cultivate the peace of mind which does not separate one's self from one's surroundings. When that is done successfully then everything else follows naturally. Peace of mind produces right values, right values produce right thoughts. Right thoughts produce right actions and right actions produce work which will be a material reflection for others to see of the serenity at the center of it all. That was what it was about that wall in Korea. It was a material reflection of a spiritual reality.

I think that if we are going to reform the world, and make it a better place to live in, the way to do it is not with talk about relationships of a political nature, which are inevitably dualistic, full of subjects and objects and their relationship to one another. Or with programs full of things for other people to do. I think that kind of approach starts it at the end and presumes the end is the beginning. Programs of political nature are important end products of social quality that can be effective only if the underlying structure of social values is right. The social values are right only if the individual values are right. The place to improve the world is first in one's own heart and head and hands, and then work outward from there. Other people can talk about how to expand the destiny of mankind. I just want to talk about how to fix a motorcycle. i think that what I have to say has more lasting value.
