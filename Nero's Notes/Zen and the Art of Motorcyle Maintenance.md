# Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance


- *The mechanics in their attitude toward the machine were really taking no different attitude from the manual's toward the machine, or from the attitude I had when I brought it in there. We were all spectators. And it occurred to me there is no manual that deals with the real business of motorcycle maintenance, the most important aspect of all. **Caring about what you are doing is considered either unimportant or taken for granted.***

- I don't want to hurry it. That itself is a poisonous twentieth-century attitude. **When you want to hurry something, that means you no longer care about it and want to get on to other things. **
