How many 10 baggers do you need in your lifetime? How many 100 baggers? Not many or none.


Question 1. Can you hunt big inefficiencies that you can repetitively exploit?

Question 2. Can you survive the ride? Can you endure tremendous volatility?


**Pattern recognition**: how do you systematically break down the vast universe of investment opportunities to a finite set of ideas that you have a chance of generating sustainably superior returns?

**Focus**: How do you maximize your return on time?

What is a horse? Monopolies or oligopolies that compound earnings per share at 2-3x the broader market for long periods of time and trade at what we believe to be reasonable prices.

Business life cycle:
-  Micro cap /proof of concept -> land of the 100x if it works
-  Replication/scaling  -> land of the 10x. Much easier to find when the proof of concept is already working
-  Maturation/Decline

Price volatility is your friend when you operate in a high prediction environment.
Find business with high predictability + high volatility 

High prediction environment: shows strong relationship between history and future. 

Example: subscription businesses with recurring revenue

High alpha does not mean itâ€™s repeatable.

Example: businesses going through a transition offer greatest alpha explosions:
-bankruptcy to survival 
-poor quality to less bad 
-cyclical to less cyclical 

But they're not repeatable. So this strategy is hard to scale.

**Difference between 100x and 10x** 
100x: Monopolies still in the making -hard to predict. 
10x: scaling an existing monopoly. The opportunity is still huge if they can execute. Plus, it's more knowable and predictive.


The strategy is very different for both 100x and 10x.
For companies still in POC phase: **average UP, not down**. Because business volatility is still very high and unpredictable.
For companies in replication phase: **average up AND down**. Price volatility can be taken advantage of.


Good business does not mean good management.
Just because you have a good business on your hand... It does NOT mean the management mean has the skill and ability to scale it. **You want an excellent management team who is able to execute on the scaling of the business.**

That's where your skill as an investor comes in. Find those management teams who can.

**Indicators of monopolies:**
a. High competitive win rates. high customer retention 
b. [[Pricing power]]. gross margin is stable over time 
c. High returns on incremental invested capital

**Management team matters.**
Because Yen's preferred holding period is forever, the people he invests with matters a lot. Elite management teams offer huge upside optionality. They tend to consistently deliver positive surprises.
