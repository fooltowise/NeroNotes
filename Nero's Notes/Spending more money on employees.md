# Spending More Money on Employees

Some firms have strengthened their [[corporate culture]] by spending more, not less.

[[Costco]] pays its staff more than the legal minimum wage, and far more than rivals. The average [[Costco]] employee makes  in excess of $20 an hour, compared to average US national retail pay of less than $12 an hour. The company also sponsors healthcare for nearly 90% of workers.

The result is that employees stay longer, thus saving on training costs. Turnover for employees that have been there more than one year is a paltry 5 per cent.

Loyal employee are more likely to excel. [[Costco]] is regularly rated as excellent for customer service.
