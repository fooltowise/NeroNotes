# Low Price Plus

A strategy of undercutting the competition on price is rarely a durable competitive advantage, but when combined with enhancing features, the pattern can be compelling. We call this low price plus. When price is the only thing that matters, a business is acutely vulnerable to competitive forces when rivals undercut. But some companies following a low price strategy have succeeded spectacularly and quite a few could be considered quality companies. 

The phenomenal success in recent decades of the retailers IKEA, Inditex and [[Costco]] attests to this. However, their pricing strategies alone do not explain either the success or durability of the model. Rather, the pattern combines low pricing with protection against the competitive vulnerability it creates.

There can be several variation on this theme:

- [[Low Price by Name]]
- [[Low Cost Squared]]
- [[Banks - a few hidden low-cost winners]]
