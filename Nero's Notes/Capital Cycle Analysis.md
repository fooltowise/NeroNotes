The key to the capital cycle analysis is to understand how changes in the amount of capital employed within an industry are likely to impact upon future returns.
Put another way, capital cycle analysis looks at how the competitive position of a company is affected by the industry's **supply side**. 

[[Capital Cycle]] analysis allows to elaborate two different strategies to generate above average returns:
1. Focusing on firms whose [[Competitive Advantage]] is strong enough to maintain high returns on capital and keep at bay competition and excess capital on the supply side.
2. Finding opportunities in depressed industries after a supply-side restructuring.


When analyzing the prospect of both value and growth stocks, it is necessary to take into account asset growth, at both the industry and sectoral level. Asset growth correlates strongly with diminishing returns.
