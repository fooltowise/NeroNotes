# On Liquidity

Take an institutional favorite, liquidity (the number of shares of a company that trade on the stock market, crucially this is generally measured over a short-term period).

The institutional desire is to have high liquidity, it appears, so to lower the probability of being caught in a poorly performing share, and dare we say, having to explain that to clients and their agents (another strike for the [[On the Principal-Agent Conflict| Principal-Agent conflict]])! 

Being in the wrong stock strikes me as an analytical mistake, not a liquidity mistake (if there is such a thing) and hiding analytical mistakes through selling shares in my opinion borders on fraud. But even so, the point is that companies with poor liquidity can be sold by institutions because they have poor liquidity and regardless of price, and that creates opportunities for those less constrained.
