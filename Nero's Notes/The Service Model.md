# The Service Model
Outside the software industry, the more common form of [[Recurring Revenues]] is the service model: when repair maintenance and overhaul revenue can be expected on products sold but whose timing and extent are more uncertain. Many industrial companies enjoy good service revenue streams linked to products sold, but it is not always automatic.

Corporate purchasers of capital equipment have several maintenance and service options other than their original equipment manufacturer, including rivals and third-party service companies.
In some cases, even spare parts can be sourced from third parties. To make the service model work, therefore, companies must successfully compete against such alternatives, meaning converting new equipment sales into service contracts.

The best result is a portfolio of long-term service contracts with large customers who pay a fixed annual fee. An exquisite example concerns jet engine manufacturers.They often enter into sizable multiyear total care contracts with large airline customers to have engines serviced and parts replaced. 

Such results are most likely for manufacturers whose products are critical to customers - such as jet engines. Aircraft engine malfunction midway across the Atlantic poses the gravest consequences. The more significant the results of breakdown, the more likely owners are to buy original spare parts and purchase service contracts offered by the manufacturer.

Service models are strengthened when the risk of damage from product disruptions are regulated or mandated by the law. Although laws can change, their existence reflects heightened risks that concern all customers. Government regulation comes into play with such products as elevators.

Another source of strength for the service model arises when the breakdown of a piece of equipment is likely to cause economic disruptions for its owner. Ship engines are a good example. Having a ship docked for lengthy service periods is extremely costly to its owner. Ship owners are therefore likely to put a premium on regular service and speed of repairs. Wärtsilä, a Finnish company with leading positions in the marine power and energy segments, excels in this area due to the breadth of its extensive service network.

Product longevity influences the value created by the service model of recurring revenues. The longer equipment remains in use, the longer it will require service and spare parts. Equipment with a useful life of two or three years tends to be replaced rather than repaired on breakdown; costlier and longer-lived equipment is more often upgraded rather than replaced.
Longevity has an offset, of course. Well-made long-lived equipment rarely breaks down and some machines will last decades with no or little specialized maintenance. The issue is how much annual recurring revenue can be expected, as a percentage of upfront annual sales. The bigger the percentage and the lengthier the time span, the better.
