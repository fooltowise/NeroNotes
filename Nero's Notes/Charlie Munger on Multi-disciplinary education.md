# [[Charlie Munger]] on Multi-Disciplinary Education

Munger argues that schools' education model should follow how airplane pilots are trained.

We train a pilot in a strict six-elements systems:
1. His formal education is wide enough to cover practically everything useful in piloting.
2. His knowledge or practically everything needed by pilots is not taught just well enough to enable him to pass one test or two; instead, all his knowledge is raised  to practice-based fluency , even in handling two or three intertwined hazards at once.
3. Like any good algebraist, he is made to think sometimes in a forward fashion and sometimes in reverse; and so he learns when to concentrate on what he wants to happen and also when to concentrate mostly on avoiding what he does not want to happen. See [[Inversion]]
4. His training time is allocated among subjects so as to minimize damage from his later malfunctions; and so what is most important in his performance gets the most training coverage and is raised to the highest fluency levels.
5. [[Checklists]]  routines are always mandatory for him.
6. Even after original training, he is forced into a special knowledge-maintenance routine: regular use of the aircraft simulator to prevent atrophy through long disuse of skills needed to cope with rare and important problems.
