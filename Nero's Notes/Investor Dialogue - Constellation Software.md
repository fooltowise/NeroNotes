### I think the first place to start is the Allscripts acquisition which was interesting news. What were your first thoughts when you saw the news on the size of the asset, it being potentially new territory for Constellation?

Analyst 1: With Constellation, most of us are in it partly because they are a great capital allocator. At first glance, seeing that they had deployed that much capital, my reaction was very positive. Getting into the deal, I was a little surprised that this deal, besides being the largest one they’ve ever done, is not typical in other ways, as well. The gross margins of the Allscripts business are 30% versus the 60%, 65% of where they usually acquire things; EBITDA margins of 10%, 15% versus 25% to 30%. This business seems more labor-intensive. It was interesting to look at the Allscripts conference call and how they described it. They said it had shrunk for three years, this being the third year in a row and they think it will shrink as far as they can see. Of course, they are selling it and they have mismanaged it for a long time, so I would take what they say with a grain of salt. They also said it was working capital-intensive and something about cash flows being more delayed in that business.

This is what Constellation does. They haven’t done anything this big but I suspect what they will do is will be some combination of price increases, adding capabilities to software and pruning. My initial reaction is positive. As I get into it more, there are some more things to think about because it’s not so typical for them but I’m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.

### One thing that struck me on the call was, firstly, they are selling it, so they’re not going to be exactly bullish on the asset, but they specifically said that they expect EBITDA to decline this year, 10% to 15%. Broadly, in the last 12 months to Q4, it was 145 million EBITDA so that may decline that to 125 million this year. They also quoted the free cash flow for last year as 50 to 60 million so, again, roughly a 33% EBITDA to free cash flow conversion. As you said, the working capital eats up some of the EBITDA in this business. That means that this years’ free cash flow, as a standalone, without Constellation doing anything, is actually closer to 40 million, which is 15X forward free cash flow. 15X looks a bit different from 10X, on the face of it, when you first look at the asset. Obviously, they know what they’re doing, so they must feel as if they can, at least, increase the prices 5% to 10% or cut out some costs to maintain that multiple. They don’t usually acquire stuff that expensive, or that big.

Analyst 1: Everyone made a big deal about the multiple being 0.75 times sales, or something like that. But when you work through it a little bit, yes, the multiple on free cash, today, seems higher than what they had done. Maybe somebody else has some thoughts?

### Did anyone else look at the recent deal?

Analyst 2: I think carve-outs are some of the most attractive places to be if you have a long-term home and you have a different cap structure to some of these larger entities. Effectively, the larger corporates are always a price taker in this scenario. Let’s call the EBITDA that was reported might be 120ish, clean, pre the working capital movement because I think that just washes through in a Constellation world. Effectively, there’s likely to be at least a 20% to 30% upside, in terms of that post-operating model structure.

For a deal like this, I suspect that a Constellation would never pay anything north of a 6X cash flow metric, just to be able to get back to their 15% long-term IRR. If you were to ask me, it’s more likely to be a 15% to 20% because the entity would have been price takers, so I suspect they would have taken a discount and this is just a bit of smoke and mirrors where, in press releases, you have to tie it back to a reported figure that is auditable. When it comes to the operating model, it’s a very different scenario, in terms of the actual M&A team.

### You think they are either going to be growing EBITDA or free cash flow from here, in 2022, 2023?

Analyst 2: I don’t think I know enough information to tell whether it’s going to be the growth topline or bottom line. From my perspective, it’s more about what the rolled-up IRR is on the capital deployed. Even with a 3% net drop in revenue, if they were able to get 20% IRR, then I’m okay with the 2% to 4% net dropping off, long term.

It’s more that I took a little bit of solace that in a previous life, having prepared PR documents like this, that go out to the external world, they can be a very different number to what is actually in the model, in terms of IRR. There could honestly be a delta of 20% or 30% between the EBITDAs reported in both those documents because one is an internal working doc; I’m sure lots of people here know that that is very normal.

### Does anyone else have a view on what Constellation could potentially do with the biggest acquisition they have ever made?

Analyst 4: I don’t have any view on the specifics of the deal, per se, but when I first saw it, I thought, the size of the capital deployment, just the reinvest rate, with this one acquisition, I don’t know if it is a change in their strategy to say they are going to be looking more for these types of deals or if it was just opportunistic? They did mention that they had been looking at Allscripts and talking to them for a period of time.

One of our concerns, in 2020, was can the redeployment continue, close to 100%? You saw that it had gone down to around 60% of owners’ earnings; how is that going to look, going forward? That was a big question mark. I would say that you trust Mark Leonard to be not paying more than 6X free cash flow. If you can deploy 700 million in one shot, that’s amazing. That was a gamechanger, in a sense, for at least the near term, which doesn’t really matter, but it shows that these guys blew what expectations I had in 2020 out of the water, in terms of redeployment.

Analyst 1: That’s a good question you raise. Is this Constellation 2.0 or is this just a one off? Maybe this is Constellation 2.0 where they do much bigger deals than they have in the past. I don’t have a strong opinion.

### You saw them announce that acquisition and then, two days later, they announced one for five million. I don’t know any company in the world that does these acquisitions on such different ends of the scale.

Analyst 3: I think that, in itself, opens up a pretty interesting thought. All of a sudden you had this company, Constellation, that was really well versed at these small two to 12 million type deals. If suddenly, they can step in to the batter’s spot and really swing at these sized deals, across the spectrum, versus something like a Roper Technologies, that is way over here in size, it really opens up the playing field that much more, for Constellation.

### Looking at this operationally, this is a completely different ballgame, when you buy an asset this big. Do you think Constellation is really structured to operationally improve and implement best practices, with such a large asset?

Analyst 1: Yes, I think it’s possible. I went through the 10-K of Allscripts, to see how they described the business and I had a couple of highlights. They described their clients as ‘some of the most prestigious medical groups and hospitals in the US and internationally’. Then they mentioned they had a number of very large practices, with over 100 physicians. That seems a promising group to keep. They said that the number of large practices that have not yet acquired this technology, EHR – electronic health records – was small, but the number that were replacing it was increasing. They seemed to imply that there are opportunities here.

Also, the future regulatory requirements will change so that made me think that Constellation has the opportunity to add bells and whistles to this software, as they go along, and support their price increases. I would think that, at least, they could retain what they have and the notes in the Allscripts 10-K seem to indicate that it is also a business that could grow.

Analyst 5: Do people think there are some macro tailwinds for a business like Allscripts, moving forward? Seeing how, on the ground, these hospital systems and a lot of the physicians negotiate these long-term contracts for EHR systems, once these systems get in, they are there for at least a decade. These are very long-term sales-oriented contracts. If you think about companies like Epic which have, basically, been a tax on every single hospital system in America, those guys continue to just land and expand.

When I think about a business like Allscripts if feels, in some sense, as if Covid was a big headwind for them because a lot of these hospital systems and physicians used their IT budgets. We saw this on the ground. One of the software practices we were selling were trying to optimize working capital for large hospital systems. To me, timing seems fortuitous for Constellation.

Analyst 1: I think that’s a good point. I don’t think it has to be a big grower. Obviously, the key with Constellation is they take that cash flow and redeploy it. As long as it’s not bleeding off too quickly – and I think they will figure out ways to at least stabilize it – then I think it could be a very good deal.

Analyst 2: I think, through the 2.0 lens, one of the things I’ve always been fascinated by, with Constellation versus other software-focused businesses, is actually the entrepreneurship type idea of harvesting the lowest R&D cost next best solution, to create for that existing customer base. Through the lens of the software products, they have been here for 40 years. If somebody was to come into that space and actually harvest, with capital, to iterate on the software packages and, effectively upgrade the existing systems and then be the owner of the next 40 years’ worth of software product, that’s very powerful.

That has always been the biggest issue. If they can’t get the big contract in a tender, then they won’t bother doing the R&D process. If Accenture can’t get a 100 million contract, they won’t bother going in there to even start a five million one, to grow the account. Whereas I think Constellation look at that problem in a different way because they have a longer-term time horizon. The ability to grow those accounts, long term, in a low-level competitive environment, that’s quite a big opportunity.

### Going back to the point about Constellation 2.0, there could be this double effect of an inflection point where Constellation may have actually figured out the human problem of scaling very small acquisitions. They completed over 100 last year. Then you have Mark and his team, at the very high level, hunting for these bigger assets. Then you have these two different parallel tracks that are fully ramped up to acquire on completely different ends of the spectrum. I’m not sure how you guys think about the ability for one company or one culture to actually implement such different acquisitions. To my knowledge, it’s completely unique.

Analyst 1: I think that speaks to their radical decentralization. The different times I’ve talked to ex-Constellation employees or executives, these portfolio managers that run divisions are people that have been there a long time and they are very capable. That seemed to be the limiting factor for them, more so than other bottlenecks; finding the people to run those divisions.

I think it’s interesting that one of the calls that I did with In Practise, I explicitly asked him, at the time, whether Constellation would buy something that they know is in decline? He was pretty emphatic that they don’t do that. They don’t buy something where they are just going to squeeze some IRR out of it. Everything that they buy is something where they think that they have a good migration plan to get it on a growth path, of some sort. I’ll have to go back and find that transcript. That would be interesting to apply here because, if that’s true, they obviously think they can make this thing grow.

Analyst 2: The one thing that I have seen from a capital allocation standpoint, inside some of these engines, is when the target becomes capital deployment then you introduce fragility to the model. That is really one of the biggest risks round anchoring a whole business model around capital deployment. Effectively, people then short cut to capital deployment, as opposed to short cutting to long-term value creation, at a shareholder level.

That tension point is the biggest opportunity but it’s also the biggest concern. I can’t name anyone, really, beyond a small cohort of really long-term vehicles that have been able to deal with that tension point. If you have employees who are trying to go at such a pace, then the models tend to circle back to valuations and what is required for the hierarchy, as opposed to what is best long term. That is what I always loved about 1.0 and this is the biggest question I have on 2.0. As you scale and deploy to larger deals and smaller deals, that everything does stay accurate, in terms of the information on deployment of capital in that M&A machine. They are only part of the solution; they can’t be the whole solution. If the organic business doesn’t continue to improve then the whole think breaks, from my experience.

### Does anyone else have anything to add or ask about this larger acquisition?

Analyst 4: I want to just comment on the difference between 1.0 and 2.0. In 1.0 I think, generally, there is less competition because, the smaller you are, the less people are looking at it. In 2.0, you will have PE, other guys and much more competition so, on average, you will have lower returns. In this deal, I’m not 100% sure, but it did seem as if it wasn’t a competitive auction and was just a one on one.

Analyst 5: One way I was thinking about looking at it is, in some ways, a lot of these EHR systems – especially Allscripts – fit within a framework of increasing net maintenance revenues that Leonard has talked a lot about. You have yearly upgrades and a lot of these hospitals are still on-prem and they haven’t migrated. Because of HIPAA and cyber-security issues, they are hesitant and cloud adoption has been slow. I wonder, in some sense, if a slightly different way to look at it is from a technology perspective? A lot of it is net maintenance revenue analogous.

### I would be very surprised if they can’t find anything to improve with this asset, but that is just my opinion. What I’m more curious about is how it would work, from an organizational structure perspective. I assume that it’s big enough to be a separate group within Constellation? I need to check how big Harris actually is. Does anyone have an idea of how it would fit in Harris or is it going to be standalone?

Analyst 1: Good question; I don’t know. Has anyone talked to management about this deal yet? I have not.

Analyst 3: Obviously, these bigger deals are probably going to have a lower hurdle rate than the two million or five million type deals. I’m curious if they will separate and it links into what we were saying about 1.0 versus 2.0, and if they will jockey that hurdle rate to allow more deal flow at the lower end that, before, was just left out completely because it didn’t exceed set hurdle rates. Now it can, in a comparative sense, to these larger deals. Or are they going to run these big deals through HQ where it’s Mark Leonard’s focus and you sacrifice a little bit more on the hurdle rate side, but you bank the due diligence and the confidence of that top tier all star management. I don’t know if anyone has any thoughts on that?

### I always question whether they would keep running at that return on invested capital. At some point, it’s going to decline.

Analyst 1: You wouldn’t mind it declining. If it meant them deploying a lot more capital, you want it to come down.

Analyst 2: I think the biggest thing that tends to be the blockage here is actually talent to deploy. That comes through in a lot of the discussion materials from Mark. The amount of folks from the business who can become capital allocators and vice versa is a huge issue to be able to actually match that with employees who have a 10-year time horizon and, frankly, are willing to buy in at this point and still be interested for the next 10 years. That might feed into his ability to continue to take on the bigger ones, as well as integrate them.

From personal experience, in terms of the integration process, in some of the deals we did, you could have 40 people, just deal related. It can suck as much as you give it and, actually, sometimes you don’t get the results out of it for the bigger deals, as well. It’s also a delicate shift to go from bigger to smaller. Personally, I would prefer smaller, higher volume and reduce your IRR threshold for the smaller ones. At large companies, there would have been deals where things were sold off, at very low multiples, because a decision was made elsewhere in the organization. That was a perfect opportunity for someone to come in with a different angle and, actually, the employees were ready to turn this around. It’s just that the engine they were in wasn’t actually the right one.

Analyst 1: I would definitely second what you were saying about finding the talent for people to become capital allocators. That is something that I have heard, as well. Finding people to fill those roles is the main bottleneck. Apparently, it’s a very demanding position there and they can make a lot of money, but not everybody can do it.

### Do you know how the capital allocators get paid, in terms of the comp structure?

Analyst 2: My understanding is the bonus structure will be invested back into shares but, effectively, from my experience within these types of roles, it’s very much market plus 20% but with the burn rate, within two years, you probably only have 20% who actually survive the burn. You pay a little bit more market rate in terms of salary but, effectively, from what I can tell through the docs on Topicus and Constellation, because he places so much value on the reinvest of bonuses, I think that gets in the way of getting deal makers who tend to be slightly shorter term, in terms of their time horizon.

The only other thing I’d add is, what he is trying to do is take a skill set from business and apply it to M&A. Most people get trained up in M&A. One is a transaction skill set and this is a risk and underwriting skill set. They are very different things. That’s why he has to train them in-house or, at least, try to blend the business mindset and investor mindset as much as possible. That makes his pool a lot smaller than some of the type of skill sets in this area.

### If you are a portfolio manager and you allocate X dollars a year, every year, you would be paid a bonus based on a transaction that then gets rolled into Constellation equity and invested over a period of time? How would that work if you want to keep someone vested for the long term?

Analyst 2: My understanding is the percentage that is the equivalent of their bonus, which will be market level, is fully required to be reinvested back into the entity. I don’t know, specifically, for the M&A team, what the comp structure is.

Analyst 3: I think the discount on divested shares varies between a five-year option and a 10-year option. Obviously, incentivizing on a longer time horizon there.

Analyst 2: That’s a double-edged sword. If it’s expensive going in, there’s a huge element of fragility to that system, especially for good talent. They have lots of options.

### What has changed in the last couple of years at Constellation to make it possible to complete over 100 acquisitions? How are you incentivizing these capital allocators, throughout the organization, to really think long term and allocate long term, across so many different verticals?

Analyst 1: One of the other things that I’ve only come to recently appreciated about Constellation is that finding the deals is a lot of work. I always had this assumption that there were so many of these VMS businesses out there in the world and almost everybody knew what they were. It’s not like that at all. It’s a very labor-intensive digging process to find them.

I’ve even heard people at Constellation say, every year we think, how are we going to do this again next year. Then they find 100 or 150 names that they didn’t know about before. It’s a hard grind to keep that stuff going.

Analyst 2: The conversion rate is sub-3%. It’s a fairly quick treadmill and I think the problem I’ve always had, in a lot of M&A models, is that they go for conversion and forget about quality within that 3%. That’s why I think Constellation is quite interesting because they are so disciplined around what fits the long-term durability question. The 100-plus is possible, but you run out of deals quite quickly, going forward, to do that.

When you go through some of their detailed nuances around the operating model, there are a couple of papers online which are like theses from students which gets into the weeds of entrepreneurship within the business; how he figured this out and then had to create new business functions in the organic business, to solve for this problem and actually create new areas to deploy more capital internally, rather than continue solely in the traditional capital allocation by M&A. That is where the superpower is, from my experience, where people can blend organic redeployment of capital plus inorganic; that’s a superpower. Culturally, it is exciting for existing employees as well as new ones and it becomes really interesting for durability.

### Going back to the point where you sold CSU stock last year, could you explain a bit about that. What was your reasoning to sell your stake?

Analyst 4: It comes down to what your expectation of price versus value is, at that point in time, versus other estimates. Personally, as I mentioned, I’ve been surprised at the upside, with how much the redeployment released in the last two years has gone up, relatively to the last five years, including Allscripts. As I said, most likely I will come to regret that

Analyst 6: I echo that. I’m similarly surprised to the upside, to see how they extend this abnormal growth rate. It seems as if great businesses have a tendency to surprise on the upside and not the downside. In our case, it wasn’t a decision against Constellation; it was just really about looking at other opportunities that we had and, also, looking at other acquisitive or similar businesses, in a much smaller stage, where we see similar DNA, perhaps where Constellation was 10 years back. That is where we are focusing.

We have some insights into specific markets, such as Germany and the UK. The conversion rates are interesting and I think someone mentioned a 3% conversion rate. How was that conversion rate measured?

Analyst 2: That would be pipeline to deal completion. It’s a rough metric. Some people might do it to signing of LOI and then there is sometimes a further conversion that they do. I would think that pipeline lead, that is actually a solid lead to a deal.

Analyst 6: Does pipeline mean an identified target?

Analyst 2: Yes; it’s not the best metric to use in Constellation because they have such long-term pipelines. But most businesses don’t have as long term a pipeline. They might have a two-year pipeline, as opposed to Constellation where, I get the feeling, it’s 10 years’ worth of IP locked up in that pipeline.

Analyst 6: I know the UK numbers roughly, as well, and I think, surprisingly, there is still upside, even in terms of visibility. In the UK there were probably 200-plus deals done last year. I don’t know what their visibility was but, even there, there is some upside. I think their conversion rate, in terms of feedback from the first outreach is similar. If you run a focused search, it’s really good, I think, but it’s something you could get to.

But yes, it’s a hard grinding job. You’re not just scraping a few databases and blasting out emails. It has to be much more deliberate, much more detective-type work, to uncover these things and approach them and then be patient. I think there was also quite some fluctuation in those areas, at Constellation, where a lot of people left. There is always the risk that they set up their own thing and repeat it with smaller things, knowing that the needle moves a lot with small deals.

### I understand CSU has a business development role, in Constellation. Is that purely just lead generation then they hand that off to the M&A team, effectively, which does the DD and the transaction? Is that how it works? Or is the M&A guy doing the lead gen, as well?

Analyst 6: That’s how I understand it from talking to some sources there. It’s a pretty clear defined tough job, where you get paid on LOIs or on a transactional basis, in terms of not the final transaction, but just getting feedback on something. They have some people in Spain who are being paid a fraction of that. It’s a pretty mechanical job and everybody tries to grow out of it, one day. That is my understanding.

### On competition for smaller deals, it does seem as if there are others where guys have left Constellation to set up their own vehicle to acquire assets. Does anyone have a view on whether there is more competition, even at the lower end of acquiring VMS businesses, more specifically in the US or Canada, with Enghouse, for example?

Analyst 1: I think it’s probably safe to say there is more competition. You mentioned Enghouse and, of course, there are other VMS buyers out there, not even including private equity. I guess the more important question is, what has the impact been of that, so far? It seems as if there is still enough for everybody, somehow.

Analyst 2: For me, it comes down to what the relative sell is of joining Constellation versus everyone else. From personal experience, in terms of competition, I think there are lots that try better in private equity and lots that try better in other businesses. But competition, whether they like to admit it or not, are not a permanent home and are still five years on their time horizon. The more sophisticated sellers will see straight through that. There is a reason why those guys have built businesses that have a million of EBITDA; it’s because they don’t suffer fools.

I think a lot of those conversations come down to, is this a permanent home? Is that sell interesting? Yes. Well, there’s only one person there and that’s Constellation. I think they win in that avenue. The problem I think you will come up against is if these new age funds start to just try and mimic them. I think this is why Constellation now have a VC fund; they can extend their capital in whatever way they want and can give people all the flexibility they want, as an operator. That’s just along the lines of, here’s our menu; it’s now broader.

To the extent that they become the large guy that you don’t want to become part of and that that permanent home status becomes untrue, that is their biggest risk. If they continue to execute and be a good permanent home for assets, then that is a huge tailwind that they have and they will continue to hoover up the market, as it grows. The market will continue to grow at 5% to 10%, I think; that’s a long runway for them.

Analyst 6: Is there actually any data on this argument that this permanent home is a good selling point?

Analyst 2: My whole career. This is the reason why Buffett is so interesting because he actually is a permanent home. The rest of the industry pretends to be a permanent home but actually churns every seven years, whether they want to consider themselves long term or not. Only over 20 years do you get into the category I’m talking about. Constellation are way ahead of everyone else in that space. That is the only data point I would use.

Analyst 6: Is there any data that says, look, here are 100 deals that happened; how many of those went to a permanent home on the same price?

Analyst 2: There’s no such data. That’s like saying, how many transactions that happened down in the market were for the reason of feeding a family versus feeding someone else. It’s a marketplace. The marketplace will have different buyers, different sellers and will have different dynamics at play that actually feed into who gets the asset. I guess, all I’m saying is, Constellation are only focusing in the permanent home category and they’re scaling at the level they are scaling at. That should be the data.

Analyst 1: Not only that, they also have a lot of expertise within a particular vertical. For example, I remember talking to one of the Constellation analysts about a new case, and them saying, we have this golf club software. They’ve got several other golf club software companies in their portfolio; they know that business really well. If they compete with a private equity guy that comes in, he may know software, he may know some things about VMS, but it’s going to be pretty clear to that seller who really knows this business and who doesn’t.

I’ve never seen any real data; I’ve only heard, anecdotally, that that can make a difference to swinging them. They know they are going here, where there is other golf club software and it’s a permanent home, versus selling it to the private equity guy or someone who seems as if they don’t know it as well and it’s more of a financial transaction.

Analyst 6: It’s always a good story and it sounds good, but when you speak to actual sellers, there are more reasons that you come across that relate to the employees, such as how you treat them. Or even specific employees that you may ask for some guarantees about. If you are a seller, you build something and you want to pass it onto to somebody decent, do you care so much if it has the same owner for the next 50 years or only 10? I would be interested in the data.

Analyst 2: The one thing I would say is, in the room, when you are having that conversation, that is a really helpful conversation, as an M&A capital allocator, to know the answer to. Are they solving for just the next home? If they are, you leave and never talk to them again. If they are looking for a home that’s permanent, then you say, let’s have a conversation. It’s an inversion of the discipline that that likes of Topicus – and pretty much every private equity house – tries to do, but doesn’t do it very well. Even the longest-term funds that I’ve come across try to do this, but they don’t do it well because the operator sees straight through it. This, in itself, is actually a form of order selection for the deal you want to do.

That’s why Buffett will talk about this dynamic all the time. It’s only in the room you find out if they are solving for money or if they are solving for something else. If they’re solving for money, then I’m not going to bother because I’m never going to win this negotiation and it’s a waste of my resources. If they’ve solving for something beyond money, then I’m actually going to have this conversation. It’s a great question because, effectively, this is the omission/commission conversation. Someone like a Topicus will have filtered those people out, most of the time. I’m not saying they’re perfect; no model is perfect. But they will naturally not compete in those processes because they can’t afford to even convert on it.

Their culture will evolve over time, to actually opt out of those types of dynamics, where it’s people who are trying to optimize for a three-year outcome and not a five or seven year outcome.

Analyst 6: I haven’t heard many anecdotes of situations where the seller said, I could have got the same price from somebody else, but I will sell it to you because you are a permanent home. I’ve heard several anecdotes of the opposite of this good home impression of Constellation. For example, I will not talk to [[Constellation Software]]. They call every second week, but I will not talk to them. That’s interesting; why not? Because I heard stories from other software companies and they took away many employees and so on. Those anecdotes are more the opposite of a good home, in terms of keeping all the staff there. They are often seen as quite ruthless and quite harsh, in terms of quickly going in and ripping out people and taking down costs.

Analyst 2: This is the tension; they have to back it up to keep that reputation as an acquirer. That’s the hardest part.

Analyst 6: What do you do? Don’t worry; I might call you for some cash in a couple of years or so. That’s not Constellation’s offer.

### Maybe Constellation isn’t as nice and fluffy as it may seem from the outside?

Analyst 6: Definitely not, no.

Analyst 2: [[Serial acquirers]] are not fluffy; that’s not how that works.

### Going back to my original question, from a competitive standpoint which, is that even a worry, at this point?

Analyst 1: Do I worry about competition? Maybe. I think the bigger picture item is, how much capital can they deploy and at what return. Competition impacts that but I don’t know that I have a specific worry about competition.

### Would you say that, potentially, people underestimate how others could compete with Constellation? It sounds as if you are suggesting that the brand equity of Constellation is not maybe as strong as it may have been or may seem?

Analyst 6: That’s my question. I’m saying I would be interested in data to test this idea that the brand or the long-term home is really a selling point in that context. My hunch is that it’s a phenomenal machine and organization that has very well thought through processes and talent that executes on those processes and the outcome is good. That is my hunch, rather than any big brand.

### Do you think it could be replicated?

Analyst 6: Probably not copied but you can take on DNA and certain elements and try to find your own way of applying it. We have a couple of investments where I think that’s exactly what they do. You don’t need to copy it 100% but you can take some elements and find your own niche.

Analyst 1: Or those various Swedish [[serial acquirers]] have elements of decentralization.

Analyst 5: From a tech perspective, is there data on vertical cloud penetration and the economic amortization of the assets that Constellation holds?

Analyst 2: There’s a good VMS study that I’ve come across, at a high-level market level, that I will send you across via email. It’s related to the European VMS market and it’s more transactional level data; it’s not actually really deep in terms of penetration levels. But the idea around the economic deterioration of the assets is quite interesting. In one of my previous careers, I would have had to value these intangible assets and then you flow them through the corporates of these big businesses. Honestly, you could choose whatever rate your want. Between five and seven years is, effectively, how 90% of it will be flowed through an accounting software or through the books. But economic deterioration of these assets is a very hard problem.

Analyst 5: I guess, in one sense, going back to the Allscripts acquisition, some of these EHR systems probably have very low amortization because they are so hard to rip out and so mission critical. Whereas, as cloud and SaaS becomes easier and easier to use in other verticals, could that increase the churn rate of some of the smaller businesses, in less mission critical verticals, that are not healthcare or EHR systems, that Constellation has exposure to? Do you think there is an interesting way we can do that study?

### You’re trying to understand, effectively, what percentage of revenue or portfolio companies are built on the cloud versus older architecture?

Analyst 1: Yes.

Analyst 1: It’s so hard to tell. There are so many transactions now. That would be a real inside job.

### If you are buying so many assets and you’re churning that cash flow, if a business only lasts seven or eight years, as long as you can top it up, it seems as if it doesn’t matter that much?

Analyst 4: The churn on EHR businesses are normally very low, but the question is, what happens if there is fancy new SaaS provider that comes to these guys and says, do you want to move to my platform? Most likely, it’s a hard sell, but they could acquire what Constellation owns. What then? What happens then when this new guy comes to these doctors? Do they say, no, we’re fine or do they switch? I don’t know the answer to that.

Analyst 5: Maybe it’s not even the new guy. Maybe it’s the sales teams of Google and Amazon Cloud that go to the hospital systems that Allscripts works through and says, we’ll just throw cash to do this migration for you. Our engineers will take care of the cyber-security risks and all of that. In that world, does a strategy of minimizing R&D costs and sales and marketing costs, that Constellation has, actually make sense? What is the counter-positioning there?

I can also see the other case of it where, in some markets – especially physicians who are in smaller physician offices – it’s not in the economics to go and target those particular guys. That’s the angle that I was thinking through.

Analyst 3: I think one of the beauties of Constellation is how many verticals it covers. Assuming that you could find a player that could execute something like that, to really take a bit out of Constellation, you’re going to have to go across 90 different verticals, simultaneously, before Constellation can adapt. I wouldn’t want to bet on that horse.

Analyst 5: 100%. I guess the only thing I was saying was, not necessarily a particular horse, but this wave of regime change and technology. Maybe it’s not like one company that’s going out and competing on every single vertical. It’s just the increase in broader cloud penetration.

Analyst 3: That’s always been at the back of my mind. A big threat, potentially, to Constellation is that legacy technology piece. If you have this wave of disruption that comes out of left field, you can’t rewrite all these different types of code to reposition every single asset.

### It could be an interesting question for management, to understand what portion of revenue is actually on the cloud, effectively, or SaaS-based. That could suggest that, actually, they have transitioned from legacy infrastructure to SaaS, which means there are not as many switching costs or less competition. Then again, if it is SaaS-based, it could mean it’s easier to rip out, so it’s hard to understand what is really better.

Analyst 5: In one of the 2012 or 2013 letters, Mark Leonard talks about how he doesn’t like the working capital economics of SaaS because it’s a subscription and it ends up making the overall portfolio economics worse, compared to annualized maintenance fees that he could get upfront. Whereas SaaS monthly subscriptions mess with the working capital and cash conversion cycle that Constellation currently benefits from. Maybe it’s a short-term dilution of their working capital optimization and I think that’s one of the things he was talking about where he does not like the SaaS model, internally. I’m sure that’s changed; that letter was in 2012, 2013.

Analyst 2: The one thing I would say on tech is, this tends to come to feedback loops. The only reason Google would get in there is if the entity within Constellation weren’t close to their customer and weren’t listening to their customer and what they needed next. For example, Accenture went down this rabbit hole, they aligned to specific technology providers and it was the worst decision ever. They learned from that and then became agnostic to it. The question for me is, are they loosening that feedback loop with their customer?

If I’m seeing that they are iterating and evolving the software they are selling to the customer, even if the core, old-school legacy system is dying off, then at least they have that customer feedback loop. That is where my risk is reduced. The minute I start to see that, I will get very worried because that is when Google, Amazon or whoever, will have a better moat, elsewhere in that tech department and them come into procurement and start saying, hey, let’s just shift over.

Analyst 5: Would you say that customer-centricity and the modern engineering design principles are part of the core DNA of Constellation?

Analyst 2: I don’t know. From my perspective, I know it’s where I want it to be, in 2.0. In these old-school businesses, I don’t suspect it’s systems-level design. But that doesn’t mean that I can’t deploy, let’s say, a hundred million of R&D spend, to make the next product iteration better, for that customer. That is very much something that I have picked up on in the more recent letters; they are deploying capital into that engine, organically, rather than solely the external M&A machine.

Analyst 3: That, in itself, is a shift from Mark Leonard’s view, 10 plus years ago where he was more anti-R&D cap spend. I guess he’s wised up to that.

### Or it just means he can’t find many deals.

Analyst 1: Suddenly, organic growth is important.

Analyst 2: One of the other interesting elements is hearing that they are doing hundreds of playbooks in these annual events. That’s amazing IP that they are building up. That is a product they could productize and sell off themselves.

### How do you look at the incremental ROIC as it scales from here?

Analyst 4: You get confidence with Mark Leonard. Just looking at the past and the future, they’re not going to that drop below their hurdle rate. If they can’t find those opportunities, they are going to return that capital back to the shareholders. You’re not going to get mismanagement of capital; that would be a bet I would be very happy to take.

Analyst 6: I agree with that; that’s a fair point. You are absolutely right; today’s 3% FCF yield is just a snapshot of today. But what you really need to look at is the movie, over time. You have to think about what is reasonable to expect, in terms of reinvestment rate and return on incremental capital. That’s the biggie here.

I think we once did it in a reversed engineered way. We took the multiple and we tried to come up with some scenarios as to what was implied in the price to see whether we thought that was a good starting point or not. Back then, I thought they were going to achieve it and they did; they exceeded it. Then again, if it doesn’t work out, I’m pretty sure they won’t do any stupid stuff and will just hand it back to you. They’ve done it before, in terms of dividends. If you then take your valuation model and change it in such a way that you go there and in a year or five years, you put the reinvestment rate down to 50% or even to zero and then assume it’s dividend out, entirely, and see what that does to your present value.

3% starting yield doesn’t sound much but it’s much better than a government bond because it will go up.

### Your terminal value of a business like this, that can’t reallocate capital, is very different from even if you are allocating half of it.

Analyst 6: You can go out, in discreet ways, and say, look, I can go further than three, four, five years; you go out 10 years and push out the terminal growth rate to whatever you assume for there and do it that way.

### Previously, I thought the biggest risk with these businesses is, let’s say that, at some point, you can’t allocate the capital, whether that’s due to competition or the market is not as was expected. These businesses don’t exactly grow very high organically, typically; they are mid-single digit. High, if you’re lucky. What would be the terminal multiple you would have on that business, with those margins, where you can’t allocate anything out? It’s certainly not 33x.

Analyst 2: I look at it as a risk question. Over a 10-year period, if I’ve paid 5X for my cash, I’ve got my cash back in five years. I actually don’t care about a model and what it tells me after that. I have the cash to play with and then it’s a, ‘where do I play next’ question. It’s not through a lens of financial model that I look at it. I would actually just look at it as a, ‘where is my next opportunity to deploy elsewhere’.

You can’t be precise about these things when you are trying to create your model today, for the next five years. I would take a lot of solace in what has been said that, when the opportunity cost is at a point at which it’s in our best interest for them to go an alternative route – whether that’s share buyback or a dividend – they will go down that route. It’s actually because so many of their own employees have a vested interest in that happening, otherwise their system breaks. It’s that dynamic that gives you the comfort around that decision. No operator is in control of what opportunities come in 10 years’ time. There is just a different lens that I would use to actually think about that 10-year question.

### Let’s say you get to 10 years and there is no opportunity?

Analyst 2: That’s an inherent investor question; that’s not an operator question. The operator question is, I gave you your cash back within five years and now I’m redeploying it elsewhere. You’re coming in another five years and saying, but what about my €100 that you have. In business, you never have 10-year certainty; it doesn’t exist. Five-year certainty doesn’t exist. I can never give you the answer to the question you are asking. By the tenth year, they will turn around and say, 20% cash flow yield, what are you complaining about? Then they will say, we’ll find the next opportunity.

There’s never going to be a scenario where they won’t find somewhere to find an opportunity if it’s a well-organized business, with intelligent people. That’s what the tech firms do. When one product gets mature, they find the next one and they go off and deploy. That’s my experience with it. I don’t know if anyone else has a different view?

Analyst 6: I think we might all be surprised with the upside. If you compare it to Berkshire, I think Mark Leonard figured out much earlier that you have to push down the capital allocation responsibility to people who are lower in the hierarchy, unlike Buffett. I think their capacity to find deals, in various ways, is much bigger, potentially. I don’t think it’s going to end soon.

### Who knows? We may seem them branch out from VMS, one day.

Analyst 6: Why not? He spoke about it.

### Yes, he’s mentioned it.

Analyst 2: I’ve just got a question on the VC fund. Have we talked about that? What are people’s thoughts on the VC fund?

### I don’t know. I think you made a good point around the fact that it’s just extending the product selection, effectively.

Analyst 5: Do they release how much the pay for acquisitions as a multiple of free cash flow? I know they release revenue multiples.

### Yes; it’s like five times EBITDA, typically.

Analyst 4: Are you talking about Constellation historic acquisitions?

### Yes.

Analyst 4: You could roughly back that out through the numbers. Just look at how much they’ve deployed and what the EBITDA is.

Analyst 2: That’s where I got my five.

Analyst 5: Their attrition rate, for customers, for those acquisitions is around 4%, I believe?

Analyst 3: That is what it has been cited at, historically.

Analyst 6: Sounds about right.

### I think what I’ve realized with these companies – and it’s the same with Addtech or Addlife, the Swedish [[serial acquirers]] – is that they say they’ve never sold a business. But they’ve never sold a business because they merge the shitty ones into good ones or other ones. Technically, they’ve never sold one but some do go to die, somewhere.

Analyst 2: You’ve just unlocked the secret of M&A machines.
