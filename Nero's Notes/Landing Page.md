## [[Copywriting]] Advices for a landing page that converts

What today's customers demand:
- high value
- high transparency
- zero fluff

The purpose of a landing page is to give your visitors something for free that demonstrates the quality of what your business offers in exchange for their information.

### **Landing page != Home page**

A home page is your PR site. Unlike landing pages and sales pages, a homepage isn't primarily used for conversion. Instead, it features your brand, tells your story and builds trust and credibility. This is how people learn about you and your business, which is great for cold organic traffic.

Landing pages on the other hand have one single purpose - to build your list around a singular benefit or solution. They are used for conversions, and are built for direct traffic, either paid or endorsed affiliate traffic, to capture a visitor's information.

### Component number 1:  A free high-value promise

Give what you would want to receive. Your landing page gives your brand a one-shot opportunity to demonstrate the value of your product or service... and earn your prospect's trust from day 1. 
The copy needs to convey a clear and singular benefit that your visitor can expect after consuming whatever free content you are giving away - and it needs to be good but not hypey or unbelievable.

Your audience is becoming more and more savvy. What used to seem like a no-brainer, sharing their email address has now become a heavily-weighted decision. They know why you want it, and what you plan to do with it. There is a TON of valuable content available for free out there, which means your leads are expecting some good stuff if they are willing to give you their email address. 

The number one question on everyone's mind is "What's in it for me?" So, make it worth their while and offer them something fo high value. And high value means something your prospects would actually consider spending money on, not some arbitrary price tag value that you scratch out with the word free. 

And lastly, be sure to deliver on your promise immediately. Make sure whatever you are promising in exchange for the email address is providing insanely high value up front. Even though what you're offering is free, it should absolutely deliver results. In fact you should be giving away your best stuff for free. It's how you turn your leads into raving fans and lifelong customers. 
That's the law of [[Reciprocity]] at its finest.

### Component number 2: A strong reason why

Even when you're offering your visitors something for free, you still need to address that inner critic. They want to know why you're giving it away and why they should take action right now. So once you build up the value of what you're offering, the next question you want to answer in your prospect's minds is "Ok, if this is so valuable, why are you giving it away for free."

A simple answer is usually the best one. "I want you to experience my work, because I know once you do, you'll be hooked and you might even buy something from me." Or "the feedback I receive about this free gift is so positive that I wanted as many people as possible to be able to get these results. Because I know once you do, you'll stick with me for life."


Justifying your offer is a key component in online marketing that is so often overlooked, including an authentic reason for a discount or freebie helps to build trust and rapport with your audience. Then you can follow up with the reason why they need to act right now. This is where you can play with good old [[Scarcity]]. For example, maybe your giveaway is only available for a limited time or while it's in stock. Or you could offer a bonus gift or upgrade to the first 100 leads that opt in. Whatever it is, include an authentic reason why you're limiting the offer. And the first rule of using scarcity is to make sure it's true.

So if you are writing a completely evergreen landing page where there is no scarcity, don't make it up, rely on one of the other powerful copy components, like...

### Component number 3: Authentic [[Social Proof]]

I do this, you do this, everyone does this - we rely on social cues from others on what to think, feel and o in a lot of situations. 

And not just anyone, but the people and sources that we relate to or who we feel are similar to us in some way.

Social proof allays any fears or doubts your visitors have about committing to your offer, and builds authority for your brand. It's also an authentic way to get your prospects to get to know you, because it's so much better to have other people toot your own horn, than say how great you are yourself. 

Landing pages are one of the very first touch points you have with your prospects. So having social proof allows them to establish a positive association with you and your brand, which increases the chances of them coming back - even if they don't opt in in that moment. 

So be sure to show your visitors how others have benefited from your product, service or content. 
Gather up your best user testimonials and feature them on your landing page with permission.

Another way to use social proof is to showcase the size of your social following, feature recent comments from your followers, or include screenshots of positive reviews that have slid into your DMs. 

Also, if you've received any press coverage, you can include an "as Seen on" logo panel or screenshot that you can link directly to an article or story. 

Be sure to communicate social proof throughout your entire landing page, and especially right before you present the offer or call to action. 

And remember - use only real social proof. 

### Component number 4: Trust factors

I have seen many landing pages that put so much focus on the design that they forget to build trust with their visitor first. So write your copy, then design a landing page to support your copy and strategically work in social proof and trust factors. 

Some of these factors include a privacy promise on your opt-in form, a clear statement on how you'll use your prospect's email address and what they can expect to receive from you, and a reminder that they can unsubscribe or cancel at any time. 

And add it anything you can to let your visitors know that you've taken the measures to secure your landing page and that it's completely safe for them to visit. Like using a secure domain or adding third party trust seal to your site, such as McAffee Secure and trusted site.

### Component number 5: A crystal clear CTA

Studies have shown that you only have five to ten seconds to convince your visitors to stay on your page before they bounce. So it is absolutely critical that you make it clear what your offer is and how they can get it in the simplest possible way. 

Your call to action needs to be front and center, leaving no room for confusion on where your prospect should click next. So keep your CTA easy to spot and use. 

And if your landing page features a quiz or some other form of multi-step interaction - break that process into smaller steps. 

According to Robert Cialdini in his book *Influence*, having your leads make a series of micro-commitments will increase the likelihood of conversion based on the principle of [[Bias from Commitment and Consistency]].


So for instance, rather than have your opt-in form directly on the site, try having a simple button with a clear CTA. Clicking that button will be your prospect's first micro-commitment. The resulting pop-up will then either ask for an opt-in, or take them to the firs question in the quiz, with each step serving as yet another micro-commitment, until ultimately asking for the email address. 

### Component number 6: Brand consistency

This is one of the biggest blindspots in marketing and you'd be amazed by how many copywriters fail to do this. 
Brand consistency is critical to locking down a prospect long term. The market is growing more conscious and intolerant of any inconsistencies in the promises you make and in the languaging you use. 

And it happens a lot, especially when there isn't a clear brand voice communicated between the team members who are in charge of your different marketing channels and campaigns. 

There must be congruence and overlap in messaging across all your marketing touch points leading up to your landing page and the promise you then deliver. And the same rule applies to the rest of your pages, your social media accounts and your customer service. So make sure your brand has a distinct and impactful voice that can be consistently communicated across the board.
