# The Who and How of your Newsletter

## The Who

Alright now you can go deep here or you can not. My secret is, I never initially created an avatar, a profile of who I wanted to speak to. There are 300 million Americans I assume that a large number of them are interested in the same sh\*t I am. So you can go my model which is my avatar is me, find more people like me. Or you can go more technical. Who is...your Who?

### **Define your customer avatar**


1.  **Demographic traits**: List out your avatar's demographic traits (e.g., age, sex, education level, income level, marital status, occupation, religion, and average family size). 

2.  **[Psychographic traits](https://keap.com/business-success-blog/marketing/email-marketing/why-psychographic-segmentation-is-important)**:They're based on values, attitudes, interests, and lifestyle. Examples include: wanting a healthy lifestyle, valuing time with family, using Pinterest to do home DIY projects.

3.  **Name your avatar**: Naming your avatar humanises the profile. If you are targeting both men and women, you'll want to create a male and female name. Sup Jane or Joe. 

4.  **Put a face to their name**: Find a picture online, I like to pick a celebrity and go from there.

5.  **Design a dossier**: A dossier is a one-page collection of information about your avatar that includes its name, picture, information, and story.

6.  **Speaking of story**: Write one about your customer avatar. Imagine you are your avatar and are journaling about the discovery of your product or service. What were they thinking before they bought your product? How were they feeling? Why were they feeling that way? What were they looking for? What were they hoping to solve or accomplish? How did they find you or hear about you? How did they feel once they purchased your product or service? This part is actually fun and useful. 

[[Who is my customer Avatar]]


This is where you ask yourself questions like...

- Who will you be writing for? 

- Are you writing for 25-35 year-old moms who love cooking? 

- Are you writing to 40-45 year old digital nomads who want the best travel deals? 

Perhaps it's the same audience as your current business is currently targeting. Determining your avatar determines how you will write, and how you will speak to them.

Obsess over these people. They're your greatest asset.

## **The How**

**Your How is essentially the logistics behind your distribution.** 

What format will you use? Long-form written word, story style? Written out interviews? Perhaps you curate the top stories within your niche.

The how also includes the frequency of your deliverables. For us, Contrarian Thinking goes out once per week. You can also do it daily (though I'd hire some help here!)

**Here are some of the best newsletter content providers out there talking about how to structure newsletters... resources we've found:**

1.  [The Rebooting](https://therebooting.substack.com/)   
2.  [The Business of Content](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-business-of-content/id1339451218)
3.  [Trends](http://trends.co/)    

My suggestion pick one format and stick with it for a few months to see how it works. I usually start with a strong hook or title. Then I go into a rant... you can see that here...

Then I go into a quick up-top TLDR summary of what we're going to talk about. Followed by the story I'm telling.

Just remember formats can change. Get started and then pivot. 

**Take action:**

1.  **Top substacks:** I'd go to the bottom of the substack page here and pick top from any channel and peruse their formats. Ignore what they say look at how they say it. Then pick one and to start just follow what they do.
