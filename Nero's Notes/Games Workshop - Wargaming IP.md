### Ronnie, can you provide a short introduction to your background please?

Yes; I grew up enjoying and playing with miniature war games and toy soldiers and I thought rather than working for a living I'd make that my career. Back in 1992, I joined Games Workshop after finishing my undergraduate degree – 10 fantastic interesting years – as the company grew and I grew until I realized I was 30 and had children on the way. At that point, I did what is called the divorce MBA which is the executive MBA working five days a week and studying the other two days, just as the children arrived, so great planning skills. I spent a further five years at Games Workshop before setting my own company up called Mantic Games, 10 years ago.

### How big was Games Workshop in 1992 and what were the products?

I knew Games Workshop from 1981 to 1983 when I was 10 to 12 years old and sold Games Workshop products in the playground, because you couldn't buy them anywhere near us. The local Games Workshop store – one of only six at the time – was in Manchester 20 miles away. I got to know some of the people then and I would go to their open days. At that point, it was turning over maybe a million pounds. When I joined from 1989, because I didn't think I would get my A-levels, they were turning over £2 or £3 million. By 1992 I worked with them in store through my summer holidays, while at university in Leeds, and they just had the management buyout. The original founder had gone, the current management team were in and they were turning over £6 to £7 million and starting to ramp up growth.

### Who was involved with the management buyout?

Tom Kirby, who worked there several years, bought it from the MD, Bryan Ansell, who sold his shares last year for £150 million. He owned them since the early 90s so it was a life dominating investment for him. I think he only sold half of them so he is a wealthy guy now. They bought it for £10 million back then, with private equity money, floated in the mid-90s and grew up mostly in full view of being a PLC.

### Can you describe the original Warhammer game dynamics?

Warhammer was a combination of several things. We all built Airfix kits when we were young and that is what we call modeling. That is where you glue them together, paint them and you all built the Spitfire. Maybe your generation did not, but from my age and older, everybody grew up on Airfix kits. There was also another geeky group called war gamers. Back then, they were all historical war gamers who would recreate the Battle of Waterloo. You would line up all your figures, which you had probably painted, and would move them around by throwing dice. HG Wells wrote the first war gaming book and Rick Priestley brought the fantasy angle which came across from the D&D and Lord of the Rings genres. Those miniatures were combined with historical war games rules.

The first fantasy world was created which had Orks, dwarves and elves, but instead of painting and collecting them, you put them on the gaming table to war game with.

### What makes that so special?

It is a combination of all those factors above. We like to go off to our geeky room and sit there and paint for a few hours. Very often, you spend most time painting and the second most time buying things. Similar to other hobbies, a camper spends their time on camping sites looking for new widgets and a fisherman will buy a different lure. No matter what your hobby is, the geek gene means you go in, get to know about it, collect it all up and get obsessed about it. But then there is also that gaming angle. It is not dissimilar to chess in that there is a board and pieces, but instead of the same pieces and no chance of luck, we have dice and battle fields to fight over. I am less bothered about game play than painting it all up and making it look nice. I play but that is secondary. Someone who loves chess is serious about the game but how it looks is less important. It is a hall with many houses in, but it panders to several geek urges.

### Do most people paint the miniatures?

Yes, some enjoy it and some only do that. Many spend weeks on a single figure. Others see it as a necessary evil and paint them all quickly to get on the gaming table sooner. One of the charms of the hobby is that whatever bit you do, particularly in the time of the internet, you can find like-minded people who also enjoy that aspect. You do not need all aspects to enjoy it. You can game predominantly and paint as a necessary evil, or you can spend ages painting, learning new techniques which is quite creative. There is a sense of satisfaction once your army is painted. I have mine over there on the shelf; when you have painted your gang, you feel great.

### How has the way people approach games and paint their armies evolved?

There has been a big change. When I was at school collecting this stuff, you were very much in the geek crowd for doing such a thing as opposed to being in the cool kid collection. It was very niche; people did not understand it and very much poo-pooed it. Similarly with people who read comics. Over the past 20 years there has been an adoption of fantastical stories, from Warhammer all the way through the whole Marvel universe, the Lord of the Rings movies, Batman and Spiderman films, and what is great is the adoption of the creativity, being able to be told. CGI meant that what we used to have to imagine, can now be put on screen. That brought all the geeky imaginative hobbies into the main stream which changed everything.

### Has better CGI in Marvel and Batman films reinvigorated Warhammer?

In 1989, the first Batman movie came out where Batman was a serious character. He was properly acted in a big budget movie that was different from the slapstick Batman of the 60s. I recently watched Aliens with my sons, which back in the mid-90s, was the pinnacle for sci-fi geeks. This was the biggest title at the time with big actors and directors, and they had to be careful because making CGI believable was difficult. There is one point where they fly across from clouds, which is clearly a model, and my kids laughed.

This was the holy grail of gaming, this was the first, this was when it came. My kids are so used to seeing Thanos stomping across the green, not realizing it's £1 million of 2nd TV work. We forgave them for that and Star Wars but with bigger budgets, people got braver. By 2002, Lord of the Rings spent £250 million on three movies, but they get a billion pounds back each. Hogwarts, Harry Potter, suddenly wizards are cool. There was a shift from the 80s where it was all weird and satanic to now everybody is watching Marvel, Thanos and Harry Potter.

### Can you compare Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings with Warhammer?

They are both fantastical worlds and all of them are iconic. We created a world called Kings of War which is set in Panethor which is Tolkienesque. They all begin as Tolkien did, with the fairy tale of elves, pixies, Orks, goblins and gremlins, then add their own flavor and color. How much magic is there and how does that magic work? Most IPs start from a core point. Harry Potter is a child wizard who is sent to boarding school. She renders it so superbly with all the characters and casts of thousands, that you are entirely immersed in the IP.

### Could Warhammer be made into a great movie or a series?

That is all coming and Warhammer was interesting because it was a fantasy one. Several years ago, Games Workshop killed that world off and replaced it with a crazy world called Age of Sigmar. Alongside that and for 30 years they have developed Warhammer 40,000 which is cunningly the Warhammer world 40,000 years into the future. There are Orks and space marines and chaos marines and Aelves and everything in the future, so it is the sci-fi version. In addition to making games and miniatures, they have made novels and books and slowly but surely this world or universe emerged from that.

Over the past eight years, they leveraged their IP and it is in 50 computer games which then recruit people into the gaming. They are talking about movies, TV shows and comics. It took longer to build because JK Rowling wrote a book which became a film; one led to the other. The Warhammer 40,000 universe is now big enough that films and computer games are possible.

### Does that make it more difficult to have a narrative like JK Rowling?

Yes, it does. I set up Mantic because Games Workshop decided not to do licenses because they had stores with their own IP. We noticed the great IPs out there and we have done a game with Hellboy who you may have seen in the movies with Ron Perlman and David Harbour. We have also done a Walking Dead game. These are fantastic because the IP has a story line and we simply make the characters. It is easy to do in one sense, but you quickly get to the edge of that intellectual property. It has a narrative the same as Harry Potter, so they are more limited.

### That is going from the film or novel to a game, what about vice versa?

It is much harder because the whole point of a game is having infinite choices. In essence you are the general fighting this army. Mantic have 16 armies, Games Workshop have 20. If you are an elf, the narrative is, we are elves. If you are human, they are the good guys. If you are an Ork, they are kind of the good guys because they have fun cracking skulls. There is no single linear narrative but rather a world you play in. It is a natural sand box where you pick your army and you fight your army against somebody else. Sometimes you do not ask why those armies are fighting, you are just playing the game. There is no obvious narrative you can pick up and drop.

Once you have been doing it for 30 years as they have, these stories emerge. Black Library novels have been out 20 years so there are characters with resonance which can move into the world of movies or computer games.

### They recently hired Kate March from Warner Bros but why has it taken so long?

The previous CEO, who sold out for millions, was reluctant because he thought the Hollywood effect could ruin the core business. When you have to keep 300 stores running and pay wages, you have to be thoughtful about that. Once there was a changing of the guard, that mentality changed 180 degrees and the share price has reflected that.

### How would you compare the core IP of Warhammer to World of Warcraft?

They start from quite similar places. If one was based on the other, World of Warcraft was based on Warhammer. World of Warcraft came from a civilization building your island with Orks. They progressed it further, as with all emerging IPs; start with Orks, Aelves, dwarves, then go off in their own direction with dragons and demons. Kings of War started from green Orks, dwarves with beards heavily armored that like gold and some kind of human story, but then they drift off in their own direction. After 10 years of growing, they are no longer that similar.

### They take different directions, effectively?

Yes and they emerge and people get immersed in it. Would it not be cool if this is what happened? When you are sailing, what about how you interact with the fishermen? You begin to create new worlds and new parts of it.

### How would you describe the typical Warhammer gamer?

Warhammer 40,000 is picked up by 13 to 16 year old boys. There are an increasing number of girls, but predominantly it seems to attract boys into it at that age. It is a combination of imagination, painting, gaming and collecting. A group of them will get into it at school and play and hang around and read, similar to computer games. They get immersed and it becomes their hobby. That was true when I was exactly that age; it was me and Nick Dignan and Christian Lynn all around there and we all got into it at the same time and then a couple of years later we got out of it.

Some stick throughout university but there is a group who come back to it and make it one of their adult hobbies; collecting, painting and gaming with toy soldiers, miniatures and table top games.

### How do you recruit younger new customers?

If you are asking on behalf of Games Workshop, that is the purpose of their stores. They have 500 stores around the world, situated close to most high streets. If you have an interest in that kind of stuff, you may have read some comics or played a game online, you would visit a Games Workshop store near you. The store manager will give you a game to play and a brochure to take away. You will go online and start looking and it grows from there. You get excited about it and tell your best mate who sees your miniatures. You both go to the store and it starts to grow and develop. But it is organic and word of mouth, although computer games are obviously impacting on that. People pick up a game, play it, then find out more.

### Is it harder to recruit new gamers given the available online choices?

It is, but the means to find out about it is easier than it ever has been. When I was learning about it my nearest store was 20 miles away and the internet did not exist. Once a month, a magazine came through my door and if Warhammer was not in it, I would not know about it. More things compete for your time and also far more information is available than ever before.

### How do you look at the potential size of the market for Warhammer's global IP? Is it just a one out of a 100 or 500 of the population who would be obsessed with table top games for example?

Yes, unequivocally it is a niche hobby and does not appeal to everybody. Those it does appeal to love it, are very passionate about it and are happy to take the time to learn more. You have to be careful thinking this will appeal to everybody, just like fishing or golf does not.

### I was reading some of Kirby’s old letter and he talked about finding customers that have ‘the hobby gene’ as if it’s just genetic.

Yes, there is some of that, of course. We all get excited about this year's Panini stickers or you watch some TV show and you love it, Line of Duty or whatever, and you drift off; you don’t really like cop shows. But there is a period which is intriguing and you start painting and collecting. But those that come back to and stick with it, the hobby gene is as good a description as any.

### Does Games Workshop have a strategy to actively recruit customers?

There is definitely no strategy. You come back to it because you want to. What is it you did when you were a teenager? You played tennis, which you drop at uni then you come back to, or one of those things that you did at uni but, as you get older you no longer want to do, like drinking too much beer. Slowly waking up every Saturday with a hangover starts to wear, so what do you do?

### Will we ever see an increasing number of girls playing?

This is happening – they paint just as well as boys – and it stands to reason. There are more boys doing it but in the painting, gaming and modeling side there is a huge swing. Role play games have also begun to see a dramatic change where it is more imaginative and less of a geeky collecting thing. Much more girls are engaging with role play and board games. Females will play more war games but you will never see a 50/50 split because there seems to be something slightly macho about the player versus player war game.

### What drove sales growth at Games Workshop in the late 90s to early 2000s?

In the 90s, it was predominantly the UK retail roll out from 30 to 120 stores. Everybody who wanted to find a Games Workshop store would not be far away from one. Alongside that we opened independent model shops and game shops with a break out range. Every year, another larger European country got some stores. In the late 90s I opened eight stores in Germany. We got into all the local gaming and hobby stores; that is how international started. From one German salesman to 10 years later, a business in Germany with 30 stores and a team of six translators and 20 other staff.

### Do they play the game differently in Germany?

Interestingly, they were slower to pick it up, but once started were very thorough. Brits got excited and bought any amount of random stuff whereas the Germans thought about it carefully, explained it to you, bought their units and got their army painted. There was a real discipline about the way they approached their hobby. I am generalizing but it was amazing that they were slower to get in but once they were in, their journey was to the point that within years of seeing a small German store start, the quality of the hobby was surprising compared to the UK.

### How would a Chinese potential player approach Warhammer?

That is an area I do not know because I have not been there for a while, but I incubated Games Workshop Japan for four years to see whether we could do it. By the end of that period, we had a room with 50 people playing games in Japanese and rolling the dice, but it did not light a wild fire in the same way it did in some of the European or American markets. There seemed to be a cultural barrier, which was surprising. Tamiya are world class model makers and have been world class tool makers, but there was no crossover from building Airfix kits to war gaming as there was in the UK. That did not happen in the Chinese, Japanese or Indian markets.

I do not know whether that has changed recently but looking at the results it does not seem to as they have had stores there for a while. There may be some cultural barriers which need to be understood, then produce a product which resonates with those markets. In every other market the games which were written in the Nottingham studio, were translated literally word for word and that was the product which was sold. There was never any market adoption in Europe, Australia or America.

### Games Workshop tested licensing but failed; what went wrong?

They took a license for Lord of the Rings, when the trilogy of movies were being made by Peter Jackson.

### Was that the early 2000s?

Yes it was and that was partly a protective move. Several toy soldier companies were getting traction and this was the first time fantasy IP had come onto the cinema properly. Ensuring no one else got it was one of the considerations. Similarly, it was a chance for them to launch a very big IP into a market place where, at the time, 40,000 was doing well. Warhammer was declining, so applying what they now knew to games design, to a whole new IP, could potentially bring new people in, and for sure, there was a real boom in that period.

### That accelerated sales but obviously dropped off after that?

After the movie has ended and the infrastructure had gone up, the costs had gone up and suddenly it was a very few tough years. Going into the Lord of the Rings, turnover was around £80 million. It peaked at 3150 million within four years but dropped back to £115 million. Interestingly, sales had increased 50% over the period, but it had gone to 100% then back down. That is a difficult message to manage when you have PLC shareholders. From there it hovered around 120 until Kevin took over and changed their approach to social media and licensing.

### Their sales went from £78 million in 2000 to £150 million in 2004. Was that mainly the Lord of the Rings franchise which boosted the company?

Yes, it was a bit like a load of adverts for war gaming. What does Warhammer look like and they had a Lord of the Rings game. Gandalf is a wizard, Orks are Orks.

### Were they buying Warhammer 40,000 games or mainly Lord of the Rings?

At that period, we were mostly Lord of the Rings. It was an advert for that. People came in, they started picking it up. It was unheard of that a product sold more than the launch month. The pattern was always launch month, then it declines. A cool game would decline to 20%.

### After how long?

It depends, but three to six months, quite quickly. You have a big launch month, you get it out there, people that are going to buy it, buy it, and then if it is a cool game that is where people's entry product is. Over the period of its life, it would roughly sell a number then go. When you launch the Ork hero or the Ork army, everyone is excited about Orks, so you have your peak number, but within 12 months that has declined to almost none. 12 months later, everyone is excited about dwarves because that is the new release. You see them decline to almost nothing. There were times during Lord of the Rings where items sold more at Christmas than at launch. We saw selling patterns change which we had never seen before.

### Is that a good strategy to acquire new customers?

Yes, but after two years when all those kids have gone off to do something else suddenly your stores are empty because you have not been looking after your existing customers. All your new releases have been about this Lord of the Rings product and nothing for 40,000. That is when they made the decision that if they were going to have 500 stores around the world, they to ensure they are well looked after and regularly filled with people who would spend money.

### Was there less focus on 40,000 and more on Lord of the Rings releases?

Yes and the customers who came with it were gone as quickly as they had arrived.

### Those 40,000 customers must have felt slightly left out?

Yes, they felt left out, but similarly there are some who are genuine 40,000 customers. Some only buy what GW get excited about, so they did that Lord of the Rings journey and returned to their other thing. It is too hard and fast to say they were disenfranchised. We were still releasing 40,000 products, but you cannot exponentially grow your product range. High profile IPs bring with them advantages which small nimble companies can work with, but they also bring inevitable consequences such that if you cannot replace Lord of the Rings with something just as good the year after, you will see your sales decline. For a PLC that is not a great sales strategy.

### In 2005, revenue per store declined from £220,000 down to £150,000; what was your focus to revive the business?

Cost cutting, cost cutting, cost cutting. I had moved up to run the marketing and studio at this point and we reinvigorated some product lines. I launched a product called 40,000 Apocalypse. We spent serious money on tooling, and until recently, had the biggest product launch.

### Is that just an army?

No, a normal game is played at 2,000 points, like a game of chess. The difference between chess and a war game is that you are not limited to one queen, one king, two bishops, two rooks and eight pawns; you can take whatever you want within limitations. You cannot have eight queens because the game does not allow that, but you get to spend your points. For every pawn you buy you can buy one of the back row ones, but rooks are 15 points and bishops are 12 points and knights are 7 points, so pick what you want. Apocalypse, using that analogy, was a 10,000 point game. Get all your armies together, get all your mates together.

Go down to your local scout hut, hire it for the weekend. Put all your tables together and spend the weekend beating the living daylights out of each other, with all the tanks and all the toys you have. Because I came from a gaming background but had spent 15 years of my career in the sales side of the business, I was able to combine the hobby knowledge of what the gamers would want, with the commercial driver of the business. That was one of the high water mark moments of my career.

### When reinvigorating IP, which is effectively what relaunching Apocalypse within 40,000 was, what is the commercial strategy on the gaming side?

One of the big changes which happened in the late 90s and into the 2000s and continues to this day is that, traditionally, toy soldiers were metal. They were hand cast by literally pouring metal into a centrifugal spinning mold, after which they are broken off and packaged. There are no economies of scale in that. The molds are £40 and you cast as many miniatures as a person can cast in a day. Plastic miniatures are very different. The mold costs tens of thousands of pounds, but once you have made it, the only cost is the plastic which is pennies.

One plastic sprue with 10 figures costs the same as one metal miniature, in raw material costs. As long as you can run that tool long enough, you can bring the cost of goods down dramatically. However, you have to be big when paying £10,000, £20,000, £30,000 or £100,000 per tool to bring that down. My job was to make sure we were helping people buy the plastics, releasing things they wanted in plastic, and ensuring we capitalized on those economies of scale which were there for the business as it grew.

### Was it mainly a tooling change?

You put some metal miniatures around the plastic so people buy as much plastic as they can. That is where you drive them towards collecting big armies. With Apocalypse, we offered deals such as, get three tanks for the price of 2.5 in this one box. Therefore, people had the excuse they had been waiting for, buy three of the tanks because it was the only time they could get three for the price two in two boxes. We saved the price of two boxes in that and because it was a high-ticket item sale, we drove volume through the plastics. It was a win-win-win. Customers were getting a great deal, the company was getting a great margin and it was driving volume through the areas we chose, steering them away from buying metal or resin miniatures.

### Do you have to continue creating new games, painting sets, miniatures or characters to keep reviving the IP each year?

The best way to think about it is comparing it with newspapers or comics. How often do you buy yesterday's or last week's newspaper? If you have every Batman comic, which is the most exciting one? It is the next one. I want to see this story develop and I want to find out what happens next. One of the absolute charms of building your own IP, such as Warhammer, is that it is constantly evolving and you can introduce new things. Models which were sculpted 10 years ago start to look a bit dated so you re-sculpt them and release those, and people add them to their army. People who were not playing 10 years ago see them and think they look fantastic.

That Ork hero that was a big release 10, 20 or 30 years ago, can come out again now with a new sculptor and a new take on it, just like Spiderman and Batman movies, which are infinitely re-tellable. People are happy to go along with the journey as long as the journey is interesting and the quality improves.

### How difficult is that? Sales from 2006 to 2016 have not changed.

Correct, they have not, because their marketing and their approach to it got stale. It took a change at the top to the new MD, and Kev, being allowed to pursue some of the strategies he wanted to and you suddenly see that change. It suggests that while moving a story on, selling the Batman comics to the Batman audience is one thing, harnessing the power of a Batman movie to create a whole new wave of Batman fans for your comics is something else.

### Age of Sigmar, which is a new world rather than a new game, seems to have reinvigorated the IP. To what extent do you need to keep evolving the IP and recreating a new world versus launching new armies or new IP, within 40,000 for example?

The truth is, all of the above. You have to stay fresh, there has to be a narrative and it has to be something you engage with. There is no point launching a new IP which does not resonate with people. They kept at it and it really did start to click and then they saw sales growth. At the same time, 40,000 has never been stronger. I do not know the split but I know it is a large proportion of their sales. To put it in perspective, Games Workshop release every two weeks.

### Do you mean a new painting or a set of miniatures or a game?

Yes, more miniatures, more games and they have a monthly magazine. More on the miniatures and gaming side than paint sets because paint sets are largely a recruiter product. As you are getting into it, you buy your first paint set, and add paints as you determine what you are painting because obviously you need different color sets. It is more like a newspaper come comic business than a car business where you bring one car out and sell it for the next five years. Every week you go to your comic shop and buy a few comics. Every week you go to a Games Workshop store and buy a couple of models.

### What went stale at Games Workshop between that period 2005 to 2017?

They did not engage with the move to online and marketing did not progress. They stopped recruiting. The store openings slowed down. Having had such a fright after the Lord of the Rings had an impact, having never experienced a backward step in 30 years until 2005, having only ever grown. Suddenly it shrunk £30 million over 18 months. Do not forget everyone had always said, all the way through the business' life, this is just a fad, computer games will kill it at some point. All of a sudden there was some evidence that it was not as big as we thought it would be. For a little while it got quite conservative.

### Is there a risk we could see sales decline as they did in 2005 and back to £300k per store revenue versus the £500k where it seems to be around now?

Yes, it has had an absolute colossal tidal wave of growth and there could be a period where you spend lots of money on new toy soldiers and start doing something else. I was there in 2005 but I am not there now; I do not know how many new versus existing customers and how much money they spend. It is possible, it could come down.

### But in 2005 you had that mix of coming out the back of Lord of the Rings and not spending money or focusing on 40,000, plus not recruiting customers online, so you could get a double whammy in how it impacts the business?

In 2005, I thought it was inevitable and so did two other people in forecasting. We were shouted down as if, do not be stupid, if you keep believing we will grow, we will grow. The metrics were not there.

### What metrics were you looking at?

Largely unique transactions and there had just been an absolute splurge of new people, 18 months, and then you started to see the transactions going down. But at the time, I was looking at a rolling MAT of transactions, which is a very interesting metric, and your sales start falling at some point later after you have taken the inflation effect out and they’d gone ex-growth; 100% they had had gone ex-growth and you could track each market, as it hit Lord of the Rings, and hit this kind of turbo charge, and then 18 months later it came back.

### Did you see a decline in unique purchases of miniatures or the game?

Yes, the amount of time people were coming in and spending money with you started to decline and at some point shortly thereafter, you will go into self decline.

### Is that a function of the reinvestment in new products, games and worlds, as well as marketing?

When you have Peter Jackson doing your marketing for you for four years, the run into the first Lord of the Rings movie, everyone loved it; cannot wait for the next one. There is the hype and the big actors and Oscars, what would that cost to advertise on TV? There is your recruiter but what happens when it is switched off? All those kids who in normal times would have got 100 this year, 100 next year and 100 the year after were coming through your stores. Your sales would be tracking and your metrics would be there. You have 300, but you got 180 in year one, 160 in year two, but by year three, half of those 180 in the beginning had left.

Year three, no one is left and the cupboard is bare. The 12-year-olds are not ready for it and the 15-year-olds that you should have had another year out of, you had two years ago and have had their money. I do not know what the metrics are these days. They are doing far more of the things which help people recruit and keep them in the hobby and keep them engaged. As always, there are things you can do more or less of, but on the whole it is far more secure than it was then because Lord of the Rings was marketing war games. Now there are far more computer games, books and novels being released and there is much more noise and traffic.

### Could refocusing and marketing the core IP reduce future sales volatility?

Yes, it has moved to a new paradigm and it will be their job to keep growing at the right rate. If they do crack Asia, Japan or India, that is another market which can go. If not, how could they get better penetration in America as they are still infants in the US compared to Europe.

### How would you compare Age of Sigmar to 40,000?

Age of Sigmar is a fantasy version of 40,000. One is sci-fi, laser guns and tanks, whereas the other is fantasy, but both are a protected IP. They are Games Workshop themed. Age of Sigmar is nothing like World of Warcraft, Kings of War or Tolkien. It is pretty mad.

### What makes it crazy?

They blew the old world up and everybody in it. Now everyone floats on crazy discs and there is all manner of crazy magic. I do not know the game as it is too crazy for me, and if I play any game, I will play a Mantic game these days. Games Workshop protected their IP realizing it was a valuable asset. Warhammer was emerged from the 80s and 90s and its Orks are green. They have given them new names and will send their lawyers after you if you copy any of it.

### Could Age of Sigmar have brought old players back into the IP?

40,000 did that more, particularly in the US after relaunching a few years ago. They got it right and many people who had drifted away came back.

### How did you grow store revenue when you ran Games Workshop?

My primary focus was to think about what would have attracted me in when I was a consumer, and could we do more of it. If there was an event on, my mum would drive me into Manchester and drop me off while shopping.

### Games Workshops explicitly say they are not a retailer, yet run retail stores. How do they approach the retail side?

They were ahead of their time in several areas. They had gaming tables, which is essentially event activity in their stores 20 years before Apple did. They had an in-house magazine 20 years before Sainsbury's did. Innovation and creativity allowed them to create a club house where people hung about and bought stuff. It blurred the line between activity and retail space.

### They have move into one-man stores which occupy quite a small foot print?

There have been one-man stores since the 2007 due to cost cutting. When they were at £150,000 per store, salary plus rent plus cost of raw materials did not leave a huge profit.

### Did they break even?

Probably but I do not know the details.

### Can you explain the relationship with trade stockists and how you found new ones?

That was always one of my passions because I came through the school of trade and I was more into that in the early days than retail. Back then, if there was a store in Manchester, you would try to open several trade accounts to service local enthusiasts on the outskirts. As the store chain grew, suddenly prior trade customers were taken over by Games Workshops stores. The aggressive retail opening program was at the expense of independent traders which was fairly unpopular while they rolled that out. They have progressed that now because people know what they are, so when stocking their products, they are aware that in a big area they may open a store.

Offline bricks and mortar gaming stores are Mantic's main market channel. We offer those stores our range of products and help them run demos and events. When they do that, our products sell, so that still plays a huge part.

### Do they run the events for you or do you have to run them?

Yes, they will do or often a local enthusiast frees up their tables for you to play, particularly in the much bigger US stores where rent is lower.

### Do you put your full range in these independent stockists today?

We will if they allow us.

### Would they not favor Games Workshop given the size of Warhammer?

Very rarely are we instead of Games Workshop; we are usually as well as. You might find if there is a Games Workshop store two blocks down the road who do comics, a gaming store would offer our range because Games Workshop stock the entire range 500 yards away. Geek stores who have a GW close by might only stock our miniatures range, but if not, they will stock Games Workshop, Mantic and D&D and we have ranges which are compatible with that.

### What drives the profitability of a business like this? Are retail stores really to drive new customers by giving them the experience and teaching them how to use the products? Is there margin made in both trade and independents?

There was a time when these stores were capped out, which was a recruitment tool. One trade salesman servicing 100 customers made more profit than a retail store. I am unsure if that is still the case because retail revenue has shot up and their online store is an Amazon store for a geek.

### Is there an opportunity for digital channels to include mobile games, as most of the income currently comes from PC games?

Those with IP have opportunities to monetize it easily and more profitably, and Games Workshop is currently proving that. IP creation is a holy grail but it will be difficult. We have been working on Kings of War for 10 years, and it is not even out of the starting blocks yet. There is a colossal amount of money in movies and computer games so it is more likely they would take a computer game and do a mobile version of it or conversely, if they have a mobile version, make a full PC or X-Box version. If you have the opportunity to monetize, it is better than it ever has been.

### What challenges are you faced with today with Kings of War?

The same problems Games Workshop had in the 90s; how to get new customers.

### Obviously a smaller business does not have the budget of a Warhammer?

Absolutely, but there are other put-off factors, like needing 200 figures to play it. You need a big army, but the market is bigger than ever and certain people love that kind of game.

### How do you find customers?

Word of mouth, online, when they blew up the Old World many people wanted to play a rank and flank game, and came to Kings of War from Warhammer. Slowly but surely, we are trying to convert all their old mates who used to play Warhammer with them to play Kings of War.

### Does Age of Sigmar offer a different paradigm?

It is a round based game whereas ours are square based.

### Do you mean a round table?

No, the actual figure is on a round base, which means you can go in any direction, whereas with a square base you have frontage, a flank and a rear.

### Are they harder to play for people who are used to square games?

Yes, because it is a different aesthetic, but the challenges are getting new customers and making great products while trying to stay in the ring with an 800-pound gorilla without getting squashed when they accidentally roll on their back.

### Is crowdsourcing a common way for these miniature games to launch?

Yes, it is very popular at the moment. One of the big barriers to making toy soldier games was the cost of creating an IP, making a game, getting it sculpted and producing it at scale. Crowdsourcing has absolutely knocked that out the way. If you have a job and love gaming, you can design it in the evening and use some money to get it ready for the crowdsource. Suddenly it can be an absolute smash hit and then you have money to complete the tooling, printing, art and writing. It has become one of those enablers but also a threat to existing businesses like ours.

Anybody at any time can come out with a great game. It allows us to approach new games and new IPs and do them really well, but it has also brought in many new entrants and bloated the market from 20 games to 200 games per year.

### Would you approach an IP owner like Hellboy and crowdsource their game with little to no risk of them putting up any capital?

Yes.

### Are those IP owners worried about putting up capital?

We are not forced to take it to Kickstarter; we could just release it through trade. We have done 20 campaigns and delivered all of them, so it is not uncommon. If suddenly you have no business experience and a million dollars in your bank account, it looks like a lot of money. When you deliver it, if you worked hard and were very sensible, there will likely be no money left. You can easily get the stuff in China, but spend too much designing it and making the art cool. Then the Chinese printer asks for £700,000 to print it all, but you only have £500,000 left.

### Is there a material risk of 3D printing changing the industry?

Yes, it is definitely a threat because of our geeky nature. We paint and play with stuff, so if I can pick an item and a printer prints it for me, why would I go to a store and buy it? You would not want to print 20 zombies so maybe you buy a regiment of zombies and they will arrive. But heroes or real stand out figures in your army which you could personalize is different. There is a real opportunity/threat to the existing business model.

### Does that worry you at Mantic?

Interestingly yes, it does worry me because we are committed with our tooling and our bets are placed in many ways in the route we have chosen. The only thing which stops me losing too much sleep is that it must worry Games Workshop more, because the price of their miniatures is four times the price of mine. If someone was going to make a knock off version, they would copy Games Workshop products. I will see how they handle it and employ a similar strategy.

### What could they do?

They could make the STLs available and people could pay for those. There might be enough talented sculptors to create a black market for it. What happened with Spotify versus Napster could also happen here, but music is more ephemeral than a toy soldier and a miniature. Technology is coming and it will change our industry.

### Games Workshop have large fixed costs with tooling and manufacturing?

Yes, absolutely, whereas we are small and nimble. If there is a solution maybe we can replicate it with Mantic or engage with different IPs. Would I print 30 figures before playing Hellboy or would I give you 50 quid and play it tonight? There might be opportunities for us to roll with that, which is different than my Kings of War game. There could be different answers for different parts of the game.

### Are bigger games more protected?

I have a Walking Dead game here I can show you. You have the box which is not necessary, but in order to play this game there are many tokens. To get those off a 3D printed machine, you would have to download them and put on stickers. There is the rule book which is not insignificant. There are cards for each of the characters and then all the minis. This would all take two weeks of 3D printing. All those components mean you could either do it yourself, which sounds like hard work and tedious, or you could give me 50 quid, order it today, it will be with you tomorrow and you can play it on Saturday. Those things will not be instantly replaced by a 3D printer, but if I am collecting miniatures to play a game, I may add a specific one to my gang.

### Do those cost more and offer the highest margin for Games Workshop?

Correct, for Games Workshop. In the Walking Dead war game, there is a character called Negan. If there is a sculptor on the internet which I can download and plug into my 3D printer, why wouldn't I? Two hours later he is ready. An hour after that I have sprayed him and a day later he is painted, ready for the game on Friday night.

### Could it be a mix of both where you buy the basic pack or table game from the Games Workshop and get the bigger figures printed?

Yes, it could well be a hybrid model. There is still value in the rule books, the game and the community. There is value in volume, but it is certainly a serious threat.

My pleasure, thank you William.
