In my [[The 1960s Conglomerate Boom | previous letter]], I described how the Conglomerate Boom of the 1960s showed us how not to build a holding company – with mega-mergers, excessive leverage, and entirely unrelated diversification. If taken a bit further, this last observation on the relatedness of subsidiaries can provide more than just cautionary value. It can also serve as the basis for organizing the vast and eclectic class of businesses we call holding companies (or “holdcos” for short). To that end, in this letter I want to introduce my simple taxonomy for holdcos which does just that.

As you can see on the next page, my taxonomy is broken down into three categories of increasing heterogeneity of a holdco’s constituent businesses: Rollup, Thematic, and Hodgepodge. Each has its own unique investment considerations and points of emphasis, though the lines between these categories blur at the edges. Holdcos do not usually leap but evolve from one category the next. As they grow and add to their collection of businesses, there is a natural undertow towards more diversification unless deliberate action is taken to remain or become more focused. For that reason, it is critical to know not just where on the taxonomy a given holdco is today, but also where it used to be and where it is going. 

Demesne invests across the entire spectrum of holdcos, but the Thematic ones are the preferred sweet spot due to their Goldilocks balance between the specialization of a Rollup and the opportunism of a Hodgepodge. More important than that, however, is whether the holdco has a strong decentralized operating model. The degree of similarity between a holdco’s businesses directly impacts things like synergy, integration, and organizational structure, and hence decentralization. I will be discussing how this plays out differently across each kind of holdco in turn, but the critical contrast between the centralized and the decentralized varieties is the element of choice. Whereas centralized holdcos seek to impose economies of scale on their businesses, decentralized holdcos seek to offer them “unfair advantages”.

## Rollup
The taxonomy begins with Rollups, which are holdcos whose constituent businesses sell essentially identical goods or services. They are typically the kinds of businesses that are geographically confined for reasons of speed, human touch, or transportation costs. Distributors and labor-centric service businesses (from blue to white collar) are the two most common business models, but a miscellanea of other kinds can work too including certain manufacturers and industrial processors. Examples of Rollup-style businesses that come to mind include auto dealers, landscapers, facility maintainers, funeral homes, dentists, technical consultants, pest control, self-storage, building product distributors, equipment rental, and many others.

The limited reach of Rollup-style businesses means that they tend to be neither very large nor especially complex. That makes them (relatively) easier to master, and their homogeneity makes best practices highly transferable. For that reason, many Rollups will institutionalize best practices into mandatory, uniform standards. This happens across all three types of holdcos to varying extents, but Rollups can get the most specific with it given the homogeneity of their businesses – standardized operating procedures, product offerings, uniforms, suppliers, IT systems, branding, etc. That is why Rollups often take the form of branded chains/franchises where the only  variability from location to location is the cleanliness of the bathrooms. Demesne tends to avoid these kinds of mono-brand Rollups because a single brand usually requires a level of standardization that is at odds with entrepreneurial decentralization (but not always).


Rather than trying to engineer efficiencies by fiat, decentralized holdcos instead try to offer their businesses a menu of “unfair advantages”. Thus, decentralized Rollups will be reluctant to formally standardize best practices, preferring instead to have them percolate up from the businesses and then facilitate cross-pollination. They can accomplish this, for example, through internal conferences, seminars, case studies from across the organization, or even simply making informal ad hoc introductions. Internal KPI league tables are another common tool in this vein. Decentralized holdcos
consistently attest that the the desire to be at the top of these rankings, or at least to avoid the bottom, are stronger than whatever monetary incentives they may have in place. For example, the CEO of a decentralized funeral home Rollup recently had this to say:

>“I've had many people tell me you should do best practices and push it down   what you learn, you push down. We tried that many times. It doesn't work. 
 The best practices are bubbling up, and we make those available now on technology tools... We have league tables every month. If you're below 50%, 
 you're failing. They know what they have to do, and they've got a lot of support doing it. You don't want to fail in this company because you're being subsidized by a winner.” – Mel Payne, Carriage Services CEO (Q4 2020 Earnings Call)
 
Taking on the role of facilitator rather than command center will also begin to reveal common pain points across the businesses that can potentially be addressed with hyper-tailored shared services, another section on the “unfair advantages” menu. The key difference between shared services in a decentralized model and those in a centralized one is, once again, the individual businesses’ freedom to opt in or out of them. . Businesses in a decentralized Rollup are even free to contract with external third parties instead, if they so choose. However, Decentralized holdcos that offer these kinds of shared services must be especially vigilant that they do not creep and begin to usurp the entrepreneurial discretion of the businesses.

An example of a decentralized holdco that does this well is Watsco, a Rollup of HVAC equipment distributors. Among other things, they currently spend around $30 million per year developing technology tools for their businesses. For example, one of the most valuable tools is a product information system that has painstakingly digitized specifications and warranty information on ~900,000 SKUs across ~1,000 vendors in an industry where many competitors (and suppliers) still operate with paper catalogues and order forms. Hyper-tailored technology investments of this scale would simply be out of reach for an independent, family-owned HVAC distributor. Whether
Watsco’s businesses adopt these technology tools is up to them, but the value proposition is so compelling (backed by hard evidence from other companies in the group) that they almost always do.

In contrast, not only are shared services in centralized Rollups mandatory, but they also disregard the standalone integrity of the individual businesses. Consequently, various functional groups will get pulled out of them en masse, and consolidated centrally (e.g., sales, marketing, R&D, etc.). This might be sensible for certain back-office functions that are noncore to the products or customer experience but beyond that, mileage will vary significantly. I have found that the centralization of sales staff is a particularly alarming development because it separates the customers’ first touchpoints from the front lines where the product is actually provided. The CEO of a
landscaping Rollup admitted that his own company had made this blunder: 

>“When I joined BrightView, we had a centralized approach to sales that was implemented at the time of the company's formation... There are many efficiencies to be gained from BrightView's national scale, but centralized sales is not one of them. We need our business development teams on the ground in our branches and in touch with the customers and communities they serve.” – Andrew Masterman, BrightView Holdings5 CEO (Q1 2019 Earnings Call)

A related issue to be aware of when evaluating Rollups for decentralization is the use of common terms like “P&L center” or “business unit”. This nomenclature is suggestive of decentralization but can mean very different things from company to company. In some cases, a “P&L center” may be a truly standalone, self-sufficient business reflecting a genuine decentralized structure. In others, it may be little more than an accounting attribution for a branch with little discretion of its own. Remember, the secret sauce of decentralization is the fostering of entrepreneurialism. That starts by measuring the financial performance of each business independently, but more importantly requires that they possess the agency to make substantive strategic choices. When enough essential functions have been surrendered to a centralized corporate center, one must question whether the individual businesses can even properly be called “businesses”, let alone entrepreneurial ones.

Centralized Rollups may not be bastions of entrepreneurialism, but that does not mean they cannot still be very lucrative and rewarding for their shareholders. Of the three kinds of holdcos, Rollups are indeed the ones that handle centralization best because the execution risk is lower given the combination of size, simplicity, and similarity I have been highlighting. Those traits also make them better equipped to improve troubled businesses, which is why I am more amenable to turnaround acquisitions in Rollups than in the other kinds of holdcos.

Still, Demesne’s preference remains with decentralization, even for Rollups. Aside from that, I also look for prospects that operate in fragmented markets, have an established track record, and a long remaining runway for continued acquisitions. With that said, in my own experience, I have found that Rollup runways always seem to be shorter than advertised, perhaps because the lowest hanging fruit gets scooped up quickest. Markets that have always been fragmented and largely unconsolidated have probably been that way for a reason. But if there is a catalyst making it more difficult for the small independent operators of the market to compete, such as rising regulatory burdens, the setup for a Rollup can be especially attractive. Whatever the case, I would rather own a business with a dynamic addressable market than a static one. I am therefore especially drawn to Rollups that flash the potential to break out of their narrowly defined primary markets into adjacent ones, thereby significantly expanding their investment universes. If a Rollup manages to do so successfully, it can turn into what I call a Thematic holdco.

## Thematic
Occupying the middle ground between the Rollups and Hodgepodges are Thematic holdcos. Neither as homogenous as the former nor as diverse as the latter, Thematic holdcos are Demesne’s sweet spot for the balance they strike between the strengths at each end of the spectrum – the specialization of the Rollups and the capital allocation flexibility of the Hodgepodges. As the name suggests, Thematic holdcos are comprised of businesses that sell different kinds of products but share a common theme. There is admittedly an element of judgment on what exactly constitutes a theme, but they are generally oriented around some combination of traits like industry, customer type, geography, business model, or technology. Some themes will be more tightly defined than others. As the theme becomes more or less focused, the Thematic holdco will more closely resemble a Rollup or Hodgepodge, respectively. A couple decentralized examples from previous letters include Addtech, a European conglomerate of value-added distributors for the manufacturing and infrastructure sector; and [[Constellation Software]], a global conglomerate of vertical-market software businesses.

Though a theme does impose some constraints on its acquisition universe, this rarely proves to be a real impediment for a well-oiled Thematic holdco. In fact, it is more likely to be an asset because sellers appreciate interacting with someone who speaks their language. This is especially the case for sellers who want to remain with the business and take it to the next level as part of a “club” of like-minded and supportive entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, on the holdco’s side, specialization in certain themes makes them smarter buyers of those kinds of businesses. The former CEO of a business that was purchased by Addtech describes the convergence of these dynamics when recalling the acquisition of his company:

>“Many private equity players questioned that our business model would work in the future and told us our commodity products would probably go down. We disagreed and realized there would be difficult board discussions over the following five years, but Addtech told us they had seen this type of business before. The most important question was asking what the management team wanted for the future, which is an efficient way of being on the same team...They (private equity)were definitely more focused on the financial side and getting buy-in from management, whereas that was not our primary concern. We wanted to be in the right type of family and have the right structure to grow in.” – Former Energy Products CEO at Addtech CEO (Interview by In Practise)

Thematic holdcos place into focus a central motif of Demesne’s decentralization investment thesis: niches. As we saw in the previous section, Rollup businesses primarily serve geographic niches. The more loosely defined mandate of Thematic Holdcos, on the other hand, opens the doors to a panoply of different kinds of niches beyond just geography, including industry, customer type, business model, technology, and all the combinations thereof. Thematic holdcos therefore have an exponentially greater “niche surface area” than Rollups from which they can spread out into further adjacent niches.

Most Thematic holdcos, however, do not explicitly focus on niches. Instead, it is more common to focus on scale, and therefore a fewer number of more substantial businesses. Niche businesses have many virtues – pricing power, high margins, customer stickiness, sparse competition, etc. – but scale, by definition, is not one of them. Yet despite that critical limitation of a single niche business, there is an effectively limitless number of business niches. The catch is that to collect them at scale requires an operating model that embraces rather than flattens fragmentation. In other words, it requires decentralization.

Like decentralized Rollups, decentralized Thematic holdcos will distinguish themselves by avoiding uniform standardization and by providing “unfair advantages” on an opt-in basis, even if best practices are a bit less transferable and shared services a bit less tailored than is possible with a Rollup. At the same time, the comparative heterogeneity of a Thematic holdco opens up new possibilities for unfair advantages that are not applicable for most Rollups, such as helping domestic companies enter international markets or establishing formal boards and cross-board membership at each subsidiary.

Thematic holdcos’ greater heterogeneity also has implications for the shape of their decentralization. Thematic holdcos manage their heightened heterogeneity while maintaining decentralization by creating clusters of higher-similarity businesses, each acting as a more focused sub-holdco.

“Unfair advantages” are coordinated at the level of these clusters rather than the top-level parent company. This clustering process can continuously replicate itself within the clusters too as they become larger. [[Constellation Software]], for example, divides itself into six high level clusters consisting of dozens of software companies each, but each cluster likewise has further sub-holdcos organized around industry verticals (see below) where “unfair advantages” can be increasingly surgical. As you zoom in on the clusters, they begin to look and act more like Rollups. A nice side benefit of this approach is that when a particular cluster becomes large enough, it can be separated as its own independent holdco. In fact, that is what happened with Constellation’s European-focused Topicus cluster earlier this year.


Juxtaposed to clustering structures are matrix organizations, a red flag for centralization. In this kind of structure, the holdco is cross-sectioned by geography, function, business line, and perhaps further vectors. From a distance, it can look like clustering, but the difference is that the management of decentralized clusters do not intertwine. In a matrix, each of the various cross-sectioning vectors has its own chain of command and they all intersect with each other. It is not hard to see how this can put the company on a fast-track to bureaucracy and lots of people with the title “Vice President”. The contrast between the matrix model and the decentralized clustering model is summarized nicely in the graphic below from ABB, a large robotics, automation, and electrification equipment conglomerate which has undertaken a multi-year effort to transition to the latter from the former.

Regardless of structure, the flexibility of a Thematic holdco to branch out into adjacent areas puts it on a trajectory of diversification. Eventually, that diversification can incrementally take it to a place where its original theme no longer applies. It is at that point that I would classify it as a Hodgepodge holdco.

## Hodgepodge
Hodgepodge holdcos are exactly what they sound like – amalgamations of unrelated businesses. The strength of a Hodgepodge is that it can be very opportunistic, buying any kinds of businesses it pleases regardless of what it already owns. That carte 
blanche can be powerful in the hands of savvy capital allocators, but combustible in the hands of irresponsible or poorly incentivized managers. This is what befell the infamous conglomerates of the 1960s, when misleading accounting standards and the blind spots of antitrust policy led to an explosion of increasingly larger and unrelated acquisitions for the sake of size without any regard to price. The largest and most famous Hodgepodge holdco is undoubtedly [[Warren Buffett]]’s [[Berkshire Hathaway]]. Assembled over the course of almost sixty years, Berkshire now owns an enormous stable of disparate businesses ranging from insurance carriers to homebuilders, aerospace manufacturers, railroads, fast food chains, and much more, including a substantial stock  portfolio. However, despite Berkshire’s legendary track record and near-universal admiration, it is not the kind of Hodgepodge holdco you should expect to see in Demesne’s portfolio. In fact, it exhibits several red flags that I explicitly seek to avoid.

Before getting to those, however, I want to highlight the biggest thing that Berkshire gets right in my eyes: decentralization. Anyone familiar with the company knows that it keeps a miniscule headquarters of mostly administrative staff, about 25 in total. Essentially complete autonomy is ceded to the various subsidiary CEOs, who likewise operate entirely independently of each other. There are no integrations, synergies, or collaborations whatsoever. Berkshire is a control investor, but an almost entirely passive one.
There is nothing inherently wrong with the passive approach, but Demesne has the luxury of being selective. I will always prefer decentralized holdcos that act as more than just passive investors by offering the kinds of opt-in “unfair advantages” that I have already discussed (best practice exchange, tailored shared services, collaboration, etc.). Those capabilities are what I think separate the advanced decentralized holdcos from the rest. However, I do not want to overstate that point. 

There is a lot to be said for simply buying businesses at reasonable prices and not screwing them up. As powerful as “unfair advantages” can be, most of the mileage of
decentralization comes from simply following its foundational maxim: “First, do no harm.” Berkshire stands as a testament to just how far sitting on your hands can take you. However, buying businesses at “reasonable” prices is increasingly challenging the larger they are. This is the predicament that Berkshire finds itself in today, as it has become so large that the only acquisitions worth pursuing must be quite substantial. That is the curse of Berkshire’s success, but there are many much smaller holdcos that suffer from this predicament not from circumstance, but by their own free choice. Consequently, Demesne will usually only consider passive Hodgepodges in the mold of Berkshire if they show a special knack for buying businesses in the smaller, unlisted, and niche areas of the market, where prices are structurally more reasonable.

As for those Hodgepodge holdcos that want to offer something more while still maintaining a decentralized, entrepreneur-friendly environment with “unfair advantages” for their businesses, the answer is clustering. I have already described this tactic in the discussion on Thematic holdcos. Indeed, the line between Hodgepodge and Thematic holdcos can be a blurry one. Uncoincidentally, many decentralized Hodgepodges were once more focused Thematic holdcos that gradually became more diversified over time.

Similarly, I find that Hodgepodges that began with a completely generalist mandate (like Berkshire) are much less likely to adopt clustering later on, and so I tend to avoid them. These observations underscore a point I have made throughout this letter: it is important to understand not just what a holdco looks like today, but how it started and where it is going. 

Consider [[Lifco]], a Swedish holding company that was originally a collection of dental, medical, and natural foods distributors spun out of a larger conglomerate in 1998. It was subsequently taken private in 2000 and the new owner decided to focus on the dental area by selling the other distribution businesses (i.e., it was trimmed down to a Rollup). Six years later, it was merged with a cluster of excavation tools businesses that were also owned by the same control investor. To this day, [[Lifco]] still regularly acquires companies in these legacy clusters of dental distribution and excavation tools where its specialized expertise is most established. But over the years, it has also 
gradually expanded its circle of competence into new niches, forming new smaller 
clusters along the way in construction materials, contract manufacturing,  environmental technology, forestry, and service/distribution (collectively and vaguely labeled “Systems Solutions” for reporting purposes and in the graphic below).

By now I hope it is becoming clear why Demesne prefers Hodgepodges in the mold of [[Lifco]] rather than Berkshire17. There is no such thing as a company that “naturally” belongs in a passive portfolio of disparate businesses. It can still work out well, as Berkshire has demonstrated, but a specialist always has the potential to be a better owner. Decentralized clustering transforms a Hodgepodge from a mere generalist holdco, into a holdco of specialized holdcos who have something unique to offer. Of course, the strong preference is that these specialized sub-holdcos are themselves decentralized and entrepreneurial but even if they are not, it is still better to have a handful of smaller siloed bureaucracies than a single integrated super-bureaucracy. The heterogeneity of a Hodgepodge usually serves as a kind of forcing function against truly universal standardization and integration – you cannot standardize or integrate a car insurance company with a burger chain. Centralized Hodgepodges can therefore be identified less by standardization and more by the bureaucracy of middle managers that mushrooms overtop their portfolio of businesses (a standardization of decision-making, if you will).

There is no better example of this than General Electric during the successive tenures of Jack Welch and Jeffrey Immelt18 (who was fired in 2018). Before being forced into a significant restructuring and divestment program in mid-2018, GE carried a corporate staff of ~26,000 people who were not assigned to any particular subsidiary (compared to ~25 at Berkshire!). With so many managers centrally overseeing what appeared to be America’s strongest corporate empire, GE built a reputation as the premier training ground for corporate executives. In reality, it was a cesspool of entitled bureaucrats and cutthroat corporate politics. Origin stories are once again helpful to acknowledge here, as the most centralized Hodgepodge holdcos (and the most entrenched bureaucracies) are often built on the foundations of highly regulated monopolies, especially if they were once or still are controlled by the government (e.g., telecom, banking, mining, heavy industries). It is not uncommon to find these kinds of Hodgepodge holdcos in emerging market countries with weaker governance and/or underdeveloped capital markets. They are also especially prominent in many parts of Asia, where business and political culture is especially predisposed to formal hierarchies. I am thinking in particular of Japan’s keiretsus and South Korea’s chaebols, interlocking webs of companies that are tightly controlled by their eponymous families; or in the case of China, its State-Owned Enterprises controlled by the CCP.

There are certain other industries besides highly regulated monopolies that will immediately make me leery of a Hodgepodge holdco. For example, in my previous letter “The 1960s Conglomerate Boom”, I discussed how insurance companies became a particularly hot commodity for their utility in exploiting the accounting standards at the time. GE’s demise was likewise attributed in large part to the aggressive and opaque underwriting in its GE Capital unit (e.g., its long-term care insurance portfolio). Though there is nothing inherently wrong with financial services businesses, they are a bright red flag in the context of Hodgepodge holdcos where the complexity of consolidating financials across unrelated businesses can more easily obscure financial engineering.

Similarly, there are other kinds of businesses that arouse my suspicion, even if they are not smoking guns per se. Those that come first to mind are listed below.
• **Iconic consumer brands** – A disproportionate number of conglomerates begin as manufacturers, distributors, or other B2B businesses. Consumer brands, especially mass-market ones, are entirely different animals. Also, I cannot help but question whether a Hodgepodge’s acquisition of an iconic consumer brand was motivated
more for the cachet of the logo than for its business value. 
• **Media businesses** – E.g., movie studios and television networks, the ultimate glamor businesses. 
• **Real estate** – A huge asset class, but it comes with lower expected returns than operating businesses. Entering real estate is a smoke signal that a Hodgepodge holdco is not good at sourcing operating businesses to acquire. Trophy real estate assets are an especially bad sign for obvious reasons.
• **Public equities** – This too is often a sign that the holdco cannot sustain a healthy acquisition pipeline, either because they are mediocre at sourcing or are simply too large. Even worse, most Hodgepodges with significant public holdings trade at a discount to their Net Asset Value.

## Lessons for Demesne
To summarize, here are the major takeaways for Demesne’s research process covered in this letter:
• **Opt-In**. Decentralized holdcos are distinguished by the freedom their businesses enjoy to opt in or out of proposed best practices or tailored shared services.
• **Unfair Advantages**. Decentralized holdcos offer their businesses unfair advantages by facilitating (but not mandating) the spread of best practices through tactics like internal conferences, internal board memberships, and KPI league tables. Similarly, they can offer optional shared services for common pain points.
• **Specialization vs. Opportunism**. Acquisitive holdcos face a tradeoff between specialization and acquisition opportunism. Thematic holdcos occupy the middle ground and for that reason are Demesne’s preferred sweet spot.
• **Holdco History**. A holdco’s original mission and subsequent evolution has a lot to tell us about its future.
• **Clustering**. Clustering is a distinctive decentralized holdco tactic that can help Thematic and Hodgepodge holdcos balance specialization and opportunism within a decentralized framework. Conversely, beware of matrix organizations.
• **Rollup Holdcos**. These are relatively simple and usually geographically constrained businesses. Aside from decentralization, look for a large, fragmented market with much runway for consolidation. Rollups that flash the potential to become Thematic
holdcos are especially interesting.
• **Thematic Holdcos**. Thematic holdcos should preferably have a focus on niches. Clustering is the go-to method for managing complexity.
• **Hodgepodge Holdcos**. Passive Hodgepodge holdcos like [[Berkshire Hathaway]] are less interesting than holdcos of specialized holdcos like [[Lifco]], but they can still be considered if they can consistently source in less efficient areas of the M&A market. Watch out for Hodgepodges with a very large corporate staff. Holdings in regulated monopolies, financial services, mass-market consumer brands, media, real estate, or
public equities are red flags.


## Closing Thoughts
I developed this taxonomy of holding companies with those that have been constructed primarily through acquisition in mind. That is the form taken by nearly all of the entrepreneurial, decentralized businesses that fit Demesne’s thesis. However, there are rare examples of companies that show a special gift for regularly creating new companies internally and empowering them with a unique level of entrepreneurial autonomy. 
You might be familiar, for example, with Amazon’s famous “two-pizza teams” strategy, whereby new businesses are planned and launched with nimble, entrepreneurial teams with significant autonomy, but small enough to be fed with just two pizzas. That was how Amazon Prime, Amazon Web Services, Amazon Video, and others initially began. I do not share Jeff Bezos’ view that it is still “Day One” at Amazon, but there are a handful of other much smaller companies that seem to have figured out their own formulas for this kind of internally generated entrepreneurship. Some of the lessons highlighted by this holding company taxonomy surely still apply to them, but they comprise a mostly unexplored frontier of Demesne’s territory.
