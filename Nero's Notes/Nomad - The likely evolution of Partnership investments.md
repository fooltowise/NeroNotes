# Nomad - The likely evolution of Partnership investments

In the office we keep a list of companies assembled under the title "Super high-quality thinkers".

This is not an easy club to join, and the list currently runs to fifteen businesses, Entry is reserved for the intellectually honest and economically rational, but that alone is not enough.

There are many companies that do the right thing when their backs are against the wall, and this list excludes those temporarily attending church. The anointed few are there because they have chosen to out-think their competition and allocate capital over many years with discipline to reinforce their firm's competitive advantage.

Good capital allocation takes many forms and does not necessarily require a firm to grow. The Partnership's successful investment in StageCoach has been due to the firm's shrink strategy, not its growth, although that may come in time. 

At National Indemnity (an insurance subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway), the firm's ability to write insurance only when pricing is good and stand back when pricing is poor, even if revenues decline by 80% and remain depressed for many years, is a wonderful example of capital discipline and good capital allocation. After all, why grow if returns are going to be poor?

However, surprisingly few companies have the strength to just sit it out, or shrink, as the pressure to grow is often overwhelming. The clamor comes from inside the company (reinforced by poorly constructed incentive compensation), Wall Street promoters and short-term shareholders.  When faced with this barrage, the voice of the long-term shareholder often goes unheard. 

We ask companies with poor economics why they want to grow. And senior management, with their hands on our purse strings, look back at us incredulous at our line of questioning. It is just not that easy to resist the urge to grow, even if economic results look so-so.

The "super high-quality thinkers" are our best guess of those firms whose shareholders could abdicate their right to trade stock (allocate capital themselves)  sure in the knowledge that their capital will be well allocated for years to come within the businesses. 

This list is a group of wonderful, honestly run compounding machines. We call this the "terminal portfolio". This is where we want to go. The question is, why is this list not the same as the current Nomad portfolio?
