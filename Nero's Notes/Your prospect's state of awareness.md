# Your prospect's state of awareness - how to capitalize on it when you write your headline

You have now completed the first two stages in writing your ad. You have defined the mass desire that makes up your market - for example, the desire to lose weight , shared by millions of women all over America. And you have selected the one performance in your product that satisfies that desire most deeply - for example, a liquid meal in a glass, delicious, filling, already measured for you, as easy and pleasant to drink as a chocolate malted.

This definition of your market, and the selection of the product performance most likely to capture your market, forms the *core concept*, or theme, of your ad. You now know where you are going to start - with your market; and where you are going to end - with your product. *The bridge between those two - their meeting places - is your ad.*

*You ad always begins with your market, and leads that market inevitably into your product.* The beginning of your ad - your headline, is the first step in this process. Therefore it concerns itself entirely with your market. It may never even mention your product or its performance. It is based entirely on the answer to these three questions:
1. **What is the mass desire that creates this market?** (which we have already discovered.)
2. **How much do these people know today about the way your product satisfies this desire?** (Their state of awareness.)
3. **How many other products have been presented to them before yours?** (Their state of sophistication.)

The answer to question 1 gives you the nation-wide force that creates the market. The answer to question 2 and 3 gives you the location of that market in relation to your product. Your strategy for exploiting or overcoming the answers to these last two questions will give you the content of your headline. Let's first re-define the job we are going to ask our headline to do, and then see how each of these last two questions tells us what that headline should - and should not - say.


## Your headline's real job

There has been much confusion about how much of a selling job your headline should be required to do. *Actually, your headline does not need to sell at all.* It does not have to mention your product. It does not even have to mention your main appeal. To demand that a headline should do any of these is to place the full selling burden on approximately 10% to 20% of the total physical space of your ad... that physical space taken up by the headline itself.

*Your headline has only one job - to stop your prospect and compel him to read the second sentence of your ad.* In exactly the same way, your second sentence has only one job - to force him to read the third sentence of your ad. And the third sentence - and every additional sentence in your ad - has exactly the same job.

It is simply common sense that the more of your story you can force your prospect to read, the more thoroughly you can sell him. To attempt to do the same selling job in ten words, instead of a hundred, or a thousand, is to shoot craps with your clients money. You might as well buy only enough space to print your headline, and use the rest of the budget for repeat insertions.

It is the copy writer's job to force the prospect to read his client's full story - not  just a skimmed version of it. Only to prospects actively seeking the client's specific brand name product, and in a case where you can offer them a special price reduction, can your headline do the full selling job. To admit a complete selling job with any other kind of headline is simply to admit defeat.


## What your prospect's state of awareness demands from your headline

We have already assumed that the only reader you are looking for is the prospect for your product. That means that he shares a defined desire with thousands, and perhaps even millions, of other people all over America. *But how much aware is that prospect of that desire? Is he aware only that a problem or need exists, or is he aware only that a problem or need exists, or is he aware if the can be satisfied? And if he is aware that a means of satisfaction exists, does he realize that it lies in your group of products, or specifically in your product by name, or more specifically in your product at a given price?

The answer to these questions will help you determine the State of Awareness of your market - their present state of knowledge about your product and the satisfaction that your product performs. It is at this precise point of awareness that your headline begins.

In its natural development, every market's awareness passes through several stages. The more aware your market, the easier the selling job, the less you need to say. Let's go down the awareness scale step by step. We'll start at the Most Aware - the most mechanical selling job - and proceed to more and more difficult problems, requiring more and more creative solutions.

### 1. The most aware

*The customer knows of your product - knows what it does - knows he wants it.* At this point, he just hasn't gotten around to buying it yet. Your headline - in fact, your entire ad - need state little more except the name of your product and a bargain price. 
For example: "Rever Zomar Lens, Electric Eve Camera - Formerly $149.50 - Now only $119.95".

The remainder of the advertisement can summarize quickly the most desirable selling points. Then add the name of a store, or a coupon, and close.

This is the typical department store, discount store, mail-order-bargain-catalog type of advertising. It takes advantage of the full weight of all the advertising that has been done on the same product before it. Its addition - its news - is the price - or a free gift - or instant delivery - or proximity in the neighbourhood. Its prospect is *fully aware* - he has all the information he needs. Here the copy writer is nothing more than the merchandise manager's phrase-maker. The price is the most important part of his headline. There is nothing creative about his job, and he should receive the lowest possible scale of pay.


### 2. The customer knows of the product but doesn't yet want it

*Here, your prospect isn't completely aware of all your product does, or isn't convinced of how well it does it, or hasn't yet been told how much better it does it now.*

Here - in the approach to this market - is the great bulk of all advertising. Here you are dealing with a product which is known - which has established a brand name - which has already  linked itself with an acknowledged public desire, and has proven that it satisfied that desire.
Here your headline is faced with one of seven tasks:
1. To reinforce your prospect's desire for your product.
2. To sharpen his image of the way your product satisfies that desire.
3. To extend his image of where and when your product satisfies that desire.
4. To introduce new proof, details, documentation of how well your product satisfies that desire.
5. To announce a new mechanism in that product to enable it to satisfy that desire even better.
6. To announce a new mechanism in your product that eliminates former limitations.
7. Or to completely change the image or the mechanism of that product, in order to remove it from the competition of other products claiming to satisfy the same desire.
In all seven cases, the approach is the same. You display the name of the product - either in the headline or in an equally large logo - and use the remainder of the headline to point out its superiority. The body of the ads is then an elaboration of that superiority - including visualisation, documentation, mechanisation. When you have finished weaving in every strand of your product's superiority, your ad is done. 

Here are sample headlines presenting solutions to all seven of the problems of this state of awareness: 

1. To reinforce your prospect's desire for your product.
   
   Association:
		"Steinway - The Instrument of the Immortals."
	   "Joy - The Costliest Perfume in the World."
   Example:
	   "Which Twin as the Toni?"
	   "Hair Coloring so Natural Only Her Hairdresser Knows for Sure - Miss Clairol."
   Sensory Sharpen I/O:
	   "Tastes like you just picked it - Dole."
	   "The skin YOU love to touch - Woodbury."
   Illustration:
   *Anyone of the thousands of superb pictorial ads in the food, fashion, cosmetic, jewellery and similar industries. Perhaps best summed up by Life Saver's classic headline: "Please don't lick this page."*

   
2. To sharpen his image of the way your product satisfies that desire.
   Much like the sensory sharpening illustrated above; but concentrating here on the physical product itself, or on the mechanism by which it works:
   
	"At 60 miles an hour, the loudest noise in a Rolls Royce is the electric clock."
	"The amazing story of a Zippo that worked after being taken from the belly of a fish."
   
3. To extend his image of where and when your product satisfies that desire.
   "Anywhere you go. Hertz is always nearby."
   "Thirst knows no season" - in a winter ad, at a time when cold drinks were only consumed during the summer - "Coca Cola".
   
4. To introduce new proof, details, documentation of how well your product satisfies that desire.
	   "9 out of 10 screen stars use Lux Toilet Soap for their priceless smooth skins."
	   "Jake La Motta, 160-lb fighter, fails to flatten Mono paper cup."
	   "In Boston, the #1 tea drinking city, the #1 tea is Salada."
   
5. To announce a new mechanism in that product to enable it to satisfy that desire even better.
	   "Hoovers new invention washes floors and vacuums up the scrub water."
	   "Worlds only dog food that makes its own gravy - Gaines Graw Train."
   
   
6. To announce a new mechanism in your product that eliminates former limitations.
	   "You breathe no dusty odors when YOU do it with Lewit."
	   "A new Zenith hearing aid - inconspicuous beyond belief."
   
   
7. Or to completely change the image or the mechanism of that product, in order to remove it from the competition of other products claiming to satisfy the same desire.
Here we are dealing with the State of sophistication of our market - the amount of exposure they have already had to similar products. Every product during its life history encounters this problem. All of chapter 3 will be devoted to some of the approaches to its solution.

We now move on to the less aware markets - with their more difficult copy challenges, and their greater demand for the unprecedented.

### 3. How to introduce new products

*The prospect either knows, or recognizes immediately, that he wants what the product does; but he doesn't yet know that there is a product - your product - that will do it for him.*

Here the problem is two-fold. First, to pinpoint the ill-defined, as yet uncrystallised desire that is slowly spreading through great masses of people all over America. And second, to crystallise that desire, and its solution, so sharply and so dramatically that each and every prospect will recognize it at a glance.

The three steps in the process are simple. Name the desire and/or its solution in your headline. Prove that that solution can be accomplished. And show that the mechanism of that accomplishment is contained in your product.

However, starting with a market in this still-amorphous state of awareness, and continuing with each of the more difficult challenges to come, *the execution becomes more and more important than the mechanics.* Here the copy writer contributes more and more to the value of the product in the public eye, and to its total volume of sales. Here the innovator comes into play. Here the ratio of salary of copy writer to production supervisor shoots up abruptly. For this is the domain of the idea man.

What are the attributes he needs?

First, *analysis*. As a copy writer you will find it necessary to define the particular market most receptive to your product, its location in relation to your product in terms of awareness and sophistication, and the driving emotional forces that have created both that market and the potential for the sales of your product within it.

Second, *intuition*, which may be described as the ability to sense a trend at its start, gauge its force and direction, determine the precise moment when it burgeons into a profitable market.

And third, *verbal creativity*, as discussed in the next three chapters, and throughout the rest of the book. The ability to give a name to the still-undefined. To capture a feeling, a hope, a desire, a fear in words. To create a catchword or a slogan. *To focus emotion, and give it a goal.*

Let us see how great writers in the past have taken these amorphous desires, and brought them into razor-sharp focus statement in their headline: 

"Light a *Lucky*, and you'll never miss sweets that make you fat."
"Who else wants a whiter wash - with no hard work?"
"How to win friends and influence people."
"To men who want to quit work some day."
"When *doctors* feel rotten - this is what *they* do."
"Now! Run your car without spark plugs."
"Who ever heard of 17'000 blooms from a single plant?"

And dozens more. Here, amorphous desire has been crystallised in the headline. then sharpened and expanded in the first few paragraphs; satisfied and documented in the body of the ad; and focused inevitably on the product throughout.

Sometimes the simplest statement of the desire is the best. "How to win friends and influence people" needs no verbal twist to increase its impact. At other times, the desire itself must be reinforced by fresh proof that it can be achieved, "When doctors feel rotten, this is what they do". Or by mystery, "Now! Run your car without spark plugs!"  Or by wonderment "Who ever heard of 17'000 blooms in a single plant?". The next two chapters will discuss, first, the strategy of determining when to use a fresh approach; and second, how-to sharpen that first statement of desire with verbalisation.

### 4. How to introduce products that solve needs.
*The prospect has - not a desire - but a need. He recognizes the need immediately. But he doesn't yet realise the connection between the fulfilment of that need and your product.*

This is the problem-solving ad. It might be thought of as a special case of the desire ad mentioned above, since the technique of writing it is so similar. Here you start by naming the need and/or its solution in your headline. Then dramatise the need so vividly that the prospect realises just how badly he needs the solution. And then present your product as the inevitable solution.

Again, this type of ad runs from the most naked statement of the need alone, to the most complicated verbal twists to bring it to the peak of impact. To start at the beginning, the most effective possible headline for your particular problem may be as simple as this: 

"Corns?"

Here, only the problem itself is mentioned - nothing more. Or it may be necessary to states both problem and solution immediately: 

"Stops maddening itch."

Many headlines in this category promise the removal of previously unconquerable limitations. They are especially popular in catalog selling:

"Lets portable transistor radio play on ordinary household current."

And many combine all three elements - the problem, its solution, and the removal of the usually expected limitations:

"Shrinks haemorrhoids without surgery."

There are headlines which promise substitutes for unpleasant or expensive tasks:

"Now! A ring and piston job in a tube!"

And there are headlines which promise to prevent a future problem, before it can occur:

"Look, Mom! No Cavities!"

But many times the problem is not so clearly defined, not so obviously on the surface. You may know the general area of the problem - for example, people's embarrassment at speaking poor English. But you may not be sure of which avenue is the most effective in reaching them. Here the emphasis of a single word - the emotional sharpening of an already easily-identified image - provides the answer:

"Do YOU make *these mistakes* in English?"

And, where the solution to the need has been promised before - where the direct statement of the solution has lost its force and freshness - then verbal twists are needed to restore that novelty:

"How a bald-headed barber helped save my hair."

### 5. How to open up a completely unaware market


*And finally - the most difficult. The prospect is either not aware of his desire or his need - or he won't honestly admit it to himself without being lead into it by your ad - or the need is so general and amorphous that it resists being summed up in a single headline - or it's a secret that just can't be verbalised.*

This is the outer reach of the awareness scale. These are the people who are still the logical prospects for your product; and yet, in their own minds, they are hundreds of miles away from accepting that product. It is your job to bridge that gap.

Let me repeat what I said when we first began to explore these five stages of awareness. Each of these stages is separated from the others by a psychological wall. On one side of that wall is indifference; on the other, intense interest. A headline that will work wonders in the first stage - for example "Dial Soap - 90 a cake" will fail completely when addressed to a third-stage market where your prospect doesn't even realize that soaps can be made with built-in deodorants. And a third-stage headline - for instance "Who else wants a whiter wash with no hard work?" - will be old had, no-news to todays housewife, who has been barraged by whiter-than-white advertising for twenty years.

To sum up, then, a headline which will work to a market in one stage of awareness will not work to a market in another state of awareness. Nor will it work, even to a market in which it has been successful, once that market passes on to a new stage of awareness.

Most products are designed to satisfy a specific need or desire. They are born into markets that are in at least the third or fourth stages of awareness. They may therefore never be faced with the problem of an unaware market.

However, many products actually pass out of public awareness or out of public acceptance at some time or other during their life histories. the desire they satisfy dries up, or other products serve it better, or they are branded "old fashioned".

Again, we are dealing with a matter of statistics. When a product begins to slip... when volume falls off, even though advertising budgets are increased.... when the name of the product no longer sells as much... when a direct statement of the product's function no longer sells as much... when a direct statement of the desire or the need that the product fulfils no longer sells as much, then that product needs to be reborn, and its problem is the problem of opening up an unaware market.

Again, this is the most difficult, the most challenging problem. There are few positive milestones to guide you. But fortunately there are some completely self evident negative rules that can eliminate many blind alleys, and set you face to face against your task. Planning a headline for a completely unaware or resistant market, then, is first of all a process of elimination. 

Here are the first paths:

1. Price means nothing to a person who does not know your product, or want your product. Therefore, eliminate all mention of price, or price reduction, in your headline or prime display type.
2. The name of your product means nothing to a person who has never seen it before, and may actually damage your ad if you have a bad model the year before, or if it is now associated with the antiquated, the unfashionable, or the unpleasant. Therefore, keep your product out of the headline, and be extremely wary about breaking the mood or disguise of your ad with a prominent logo.
3. And this is the hardest fact of all to accept. At this stage of your market, a direct statement of what your product does, what desires it satisfies, or what problem it solves, simply will not work. Your product either has not reached that direct stage, or has passed beyond it. And you cannot simply shift from one desire to another. You are not faced here with a problem of sophistication, but one of complete indifference, or unacceptability. Therefore, the performance of your product, and the desire it satisfies, can only be brought in later. You cannot mention them in your headline.

So you cannot mention price, product, function or desire. What do you have left? *Your market, of course!* And the distinct possibility that by broadening your appeal beyond price, product function or specific desire, you can reach the maximum limits of your full potential market; consolidate splinter appeals; and increase the sales of your product at a fantastic rate.

Once you have accepted the challenge of writing this kind of ad, then your product and its attributes fade into the background, and you concentrate exclusively on the state of mind of your market at this particular moment.

What you are doing essentially in this fifth stage is *calling your market together* in the headline of your ad. You are writing and identification headline. You are selling nothing, promising nothing, satisfying nothing. Instead, you are echoing an emotion, an attitude, a satisfaction that picks people out from the crowd and binds them together in a single statement.

In this type of headline, you are telling them what they are. You are defining them for themselves. You are giving them the information they need and want, about a problem still so vague that you are the first to put it into words.

Here, above all, is the type of headline that never attempts to sell a product or performance, but simply tries to sell the remainder of the ad itself - the information that follows on the page. The only function of this headline is to get the prospect to read the next paragraph. And this second paragraph pulls him into the third; and the third into the fourth; and right on down the page, paragraph after paragraph.

Meanwhile these paragraphs are building a steady progression of logical images, from the first identification with the headline, to a growing awareness of the problem or the desire to the realisation that a solution is at hand, and to the inevitable focusing of that desire and that solution onto your particular product.

This, then, is the general strategy of dealing with an unaware market. The application of this strategy, when all direct methods have failed, has produced hundreds of great headlines. It would be impossible to classify all of them, since each solution establishes its own new pattern. However, there are definite landmarks and directions we can distinguish. Here are some of them - starting with the general principle they used, then the problem they solved, then the headline itself, and then the most important structural paragraph of body copy.


## Giving words to a hidden dream

Problem: to expand the market for home correspondence courses beyond that obtained by "Earn more money" and "Gain more skill" headlines. 

The solution:

			THE UNIVERSITY OF THE NIGHT
		The young Lincoln, poring over borrowed school-books far into the night - seeking in the dim  light of his log fire the transforming light of knowledge - eager to grow - eager to do... here is an example which has inspired the man who strives against the odds of circumstances to make his place in the world.
		Tonight, in cities and towns and villages... thousands of men will drop their daily labors to fight, beneath the lamp, the battle that Lincoln fought...
		Up from the mines, down from the mast of ships... from all the places where men work, they will go home and take up their books because they yearn to grow, because they seek higher training, greater skill, more responsibility.
		Some of them are men who work in one field whereas their talents and desires are in another. Some... are halted in their progress because they do not understand the higher principles of their business or profession. Some left school in boyhood because poverty made it necessary...
		Fifty years ago these men... would have had no place to turn for the courses of study and for the personal guidance they need.
		Thirty years ago there was founded a school to help them - a school created for their needs and circumstances - a school that goes to them no matter where they are - a school...
		Created in response to a need, the International Correspondence Schools have developed their scope and usefulness to the growth of that need...
		
		
## Exploiting a hidden fear

Problem: To re-vitalise the sales of a coffee substitute, long after health headlines and pep headlines and taste headlines had failed. Secondary problem: To overcome a slipping brand name, that was no longer an asset in either the headline or the logo. 

The solution:

			WHY MEN CRACK...
		An authority of international standing recently wrote: "You have overeaten and plugged your organs with moderate stimulants, the worst of which are not only alcohol and tobacco, but caffeine and sugar..."
		You know them. Strong men. Vigorous men, robust men - men who never had a sick day in their lives. They drive. They drive themselves to the limit. They lash themselves *over* the limit with stimulants. They crack. Often, they crash.
		
		You have seen them afterwards. Pitiful shells. The zest gone, the fire gone. Burnt-out furnaces of energy.
		"He was such a healthy-looking man..."
		He was. His health was his undoing. His constitution absorbed punishment. Otherwise he might have been warned in time.
		"For every action there is an equal and contrary reaction" You learned the law in physics. It applies to bodies.
		For every once of energy gained by stiimulation, by whipping the nerves to action, an ounce of reserve strength is drained... But repeated withdrawals exhaust any reserve. Physical bankruptcy. Then the crash....
		It's time to get back to normal, to close the drafts, to bank some of the fires...
		Avoid stimulants. What is good for the boy is good for the man...
		Borrowed energy must be repaid!
		Two million Americans families avoid caffeine by drinking Postum. And two million American families are better off for it...




















## Leading Into an Unacceptable Problem by Starting with a Universally accepted Image

Problem: To gain both publisher and prospect acceptance for a woman deodorant. A direct statement of the performance of product would not only offend, but would never be published. 

The solution:

				WITHIN THE CURVE OF A WOMAN'S ARM
			A frank discussion of a subject too often avoided.
			A woman's arm! Poets have sung of its grace. Artists have painted its beauty.
			It should be the daintiest, sweetest thing in the world. And yet, unfortunately, it isn't, always.
			There's an old offender in this quest for perfect daintiness - an offender of which we ourselves may be ever so unconscious, but which is just as truly present.
			Shall we discuss it frankly?
			Many a woman who says, "No, I am never annoyed by perspiration," does not know the facts...
			Of course, we aren't to blame because nature has made us so that the perspiration glands under the arms ar emore active than anywhere else. Nor are we to blame because... have made normal evaporation there impossible.
			Would you be absolutely sure of your daintiness?
			It is the chemicals of the body, not uncleanliness, that cause oder. And even thought there is no active perspiration - nor apparent moisture - there may be under the arms an odor...
			Fastidious women who want to be absolutely sure of their daintiness have found that they could not trust to their own consciousness; they have feld the need of a toilet water which would insure them against any of this kind of underarm unpleasantness, either moisture or odor.
			To meet this need, a physician formulated Odorona - a perfectly harmless and delightful toilet water...
			
			
## To project a hidden desire which cannot be put bluntly into words

Problem: to capitalize on research findings that smoking cigarettes gives men a feeling of virility, importance, sexual strength. Any verbal expression, however, would be instantly rejected as absurd and offensive. 

The Solution:
			The Marlboro Tattoo ad: With its virile men (cowboys, racing car drivers, sky divers, etc.) whose appearance alone projected more of an image of raw virility than any number of words could ever convey.

## Using a common resentment or unvoiced protest to capture a far greater market than the direct statement of the solution of that resentment would produce

Problem: To sell a do-it-yourself book on television repairs. Although all owners of TV sets were the potential market, only a small fraction considered themselves interested enough or capable enough to respond to a direct promise headline: "Save up to $100 a year on your TV repairs!" Most were afraid they could not make the repairs themselves. Therefore, the market must be broadened to include the non-handymen owners, by exploiting the existing resentment against TV service contracts. 

The Solution:

				WHY HAVEN'T TV OWNERS BEEN TOLD THESE FACTS
			Was your set purchased after the spring of 1947? Then here is the full, uncensored story of how you can avoid those $15-$20 repair bills - avoid those $30-830 a year service fees - and still get the perfect, movie-clear pictures you've dreamed about!
			How many times this week have you had to get up to fix a jumpy TV picture? How many times have you had to put up with ghosts?
			90% of these breakdowns are unnecessary!
			All these breakdowns may have seemed tragic to you at the moment they happened - but here is the real tragedy! Do oyu know that the same exact set that you now have in your fron room... has been playing in manufacturer's test rooms for months - and playing perfectly!
			These sets have been subjected to "Breakdown Tests"... These sets have been tested against every conceivable type of viewing hazard... And, in almost everyone of these cases, these sets have produced perfect, movie-clear pictures, without major breakdowns, for as much as one full year! here are some of the reasons why:
			*What TV experts have learned about your set*
			If your set were properly cared for, as these sets were... it need break down only once dring the entire year...
			If your set were properly cared for, it can actually give you perfect, movie-clear reception the other 364 days of the year...
			And most important, these experts have discovered that you do not have to be a handyman or a mechanic in order to coax this performance... Here's why:
			*5 Minutes a week for perfect reception*
			These TV experts have discoverd that your TV set is a great deal like your body in this respect - that it gives warning signales before it has a major breakdown...
			Now, if you had the knowledge to make a few minor adjustments, on the outside controls of that set, then you could correct those symptoms...
			If you do not have that knowledge... then your set will weaken, you will have a constantly bad picture...
			It's as simple as that. You pay a repairman - not for his work, but for his knowledge. If you had that knowledge yourself - then you would not have to pay him at all...
			Now suppose that you had a TV expoert at your elbow 24 hours a day. Suppose that every time your set began to flicker, or jump... this expert would show you exactly what knob on the outside of your set you could turn...
			Suppose that every time you were annoyed by ghosts... this expert would show you a simple non-mechanical trick...
			Yes, and suppose that even when your set went black, this expert could show you...
			*All the information you need about your TV set!
			This is exactly what a new book, the TELEVISION OWNER'S GUIDE does for you...

## Projecting an ultimate triumph that the prospect will identify with

Problem: To sell music lessons by correspondence to a greater audience than would respond to a direct "Play real tunes on the piano in five days" approach. 

The solution:

				THEY LAUGHED WHEN I SAT DOWN AT THE PIANO. BUT WHEN I STARTED TO PLAY!
			Arthur has just played "The rosary". The room rang with applause. I decided that this would be a dramatic moment for me to make my debut. To the amazement of all my friends, I strode confidently over to the piano and sat down.
			"Jack is up to his old tricks", somebody chuckled. The crowd laughed.
			"Can he really play?" I heard a girl whisper to Arthur. 
			"Heavens, no!" Arthur explained. "He never played a note in his life. But you just watch him. This is going to be good..."
			*Then I started to play...*
			Instantly a tense silence fell on the guests. The laughter died on their lips as if by magic... I heard gasps of amazement. My friends sat breathless - spellbound.
			I played on and on and as I played I forgot the people around me. I forgot the hour, the place, the breathless listeners. The little world I lived in seemed to fade - seemed to grow dim - unreal. Only the music was real... It seemed as if the master musician himself was speaking to me... not in words but in chords. Not in sentences but in exquisite melodies!
			*A complete triumph!*
			As the last notes of the Moonlight Sonata died away, the room resounded with a sudden roar of applause. I found myself surrounded by excited faces. How my friends carried on! Men shook me by the hand - wildly congratulated me - pounded me on the back with their enthusiasm! Everybody was exclaiming with delight - playing me with rapid questions... "Jack! Why didn't you tell us you could play like that?"..."Where did you learn?"... "How long have you studied?"..."Who was your teacher?"
			"I have never even seen my teacher," I replied. "And just a short while ago I couldn't even play a note."
			"Quit your kidding," laughed Arthur, himself an accomplished pianist. "You've been studying for years, I can tell."
			"I have been studying only a short while," I insisted. "I decided to keep it a secret so I could surprise all you folks."
			Then I told them the whole story.
			"Have you ever heard of the U.S. School of Music?"
			A few of my friends nodded. "That's a correspondence school, isn't it?" they exclaimed.
			"Exactly," I replied. "They have a new simplified method that can teach you to play any instrument by mail in just a few short months..."



## Projecting the result of a problem in such a way that it will be identified with by people who would reject a direct statement of the problem itself

Problem: To increase the sales of mouthwash, not only on a germ theme (which could be immediately accepted), but on the more universal social offence theme, which would be rejected in its direct form. The idea of bad breath was too insulting to be taken by the public "straight". 

The solution:

						OFTEN A BRIDESMAID BUT NEVER A BRIDE
					Edna's case was really a pathetic one. Like every woman, her priimary ambition was to marry. Most of the girls in her set were married - or about to be. Yet no one possessed more charm or grace or loveliness than she.
					And as her birthdays crept gradually toward that tragic thirty mark, marriage seemed farther from her life than ever.
					She was often a bridesmaid but never a bride.
					That's the insidious thing about halitosis (unpleasant breath). You, yourself rarely know when you have it. And even your closest friends won't tell you.
					Sometimes, of course, halitosis comes from some deep seated organic disorder that requires professional advice. But usually - and fortunately - halitosis is only a local condition that yiedls to the regular use of Listerine as a mouth wash and gargle. it is an interesting thing this this well-known antiseptic that has been in use for years for surgical dressings possesses these unusual properties as a breath deodorant...

## Projecting the result of an accomplishment to attract people who would be frightened away by the work implied to achieve it

Problem: To broaden the market for home correspondence courses, beyond that possible with a direct statement fo the immediate result - learning or skill. An attempt must be made to direct the prospect's mind away from effort, to reward. 

The solution:

						"HERE'S AN EXTRA $50, GRACE-"
					I'm making real money now!
					Yes, I've been keeping it a secret until pay day came. I've been promoted with an increase of $50 a month. And the first extra money is yours. Just a little reward for urging me to study at home. The boss saw my spare time training has made me a valuable man to the firm and there's more money coming soon. We're starting up easy street, Grace, thanks to you and the I.C.S..."

## The list never ends

Every day new solution, new patterns are being created. Wherever the direct appeal fails, or loses its power, you should begin to explore a fifth stage headline.

However, there are two vital points to remember in connection with this problem. First of all, this type of headline is infinitely more difficult to bring home to the target than any of the other four types. You are far more likely to miss the mark on this headline, because you have far fewer guideposts to direct you. *Your headline no longer refers to your product, but it must therefore refer even more strongly to your market.* It cannot simply be a startler, or an attention-getter, or humorous, or cute. Nor can it mask the fact that it has no headline behind a pretty picture. Most copy writers use a fifth stage problem to write an empty headline, and are therefore simply wasting their client's money.

Because it is so easy to wander off into an irrelevant headline, keep this one cardinal rule in mind. **Your prospect must identify with your headline before he can buy from it.** It must be *his* headline, his problem, his state of mind at that particular moment. It must pick out the product's logical prospects - and reject as many people as it attracts.

And, if it is an effective headline, and it works, then it too will become outdated as your market moves on to a new stage of awareness. And you will be presented with another problem, just as challenging, just as rewarding, as the one you have solved before. You never step in the same river twice. No market ever stands still.


## A final word on style in advertising copy

Markets change; desires change; fashions change. And so do the acceptable styles of advertisements change. Certain advertising styles - the form your advertising message takes - grow tired with time - then stale - then actually laughable. At the turn of the century, effective ads were written in verse; twenty years later, no one would believe them. In the 1920s most of the great ads were narrative stories - either first-person confessions, or third person revelations, or comic strip dramatisations. Today everything but the comic strip is gone - and we see less and less of it every year. When a new style is born, people believe it, and it reinforces the message it is carrying. When that same style grows trite, people cannot see the message for the advertisement.

Meanwhile, one more note here. In effective advertising, though styles may change, strategy does not. If you study the piano and bridesmaid ads in this chapter, you will notice this: that while the narrative style of both is now old-had, you can still respond to their power. Both tap desires that still exist - though now perhaps directed toward different products and different problems. And both evoke those desires, and channel those desires, so effectively, that if they were rewritten in today's idiom, and applied to different products, they still might sell millions of dollars worth of good today.
