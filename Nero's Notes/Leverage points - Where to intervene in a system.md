In order of increasing efficiency:

12. **Changing Constants and parameters**

For instance, changing the constants regulating the inflows and outflows of a stock

11. **Buffers : The sizes of stabilizing stocks relative to their flows**

Increasing buffer size increases stability, but has often a physical costs and makes the system more resistant to change

10. **Stocks and Flow structures - Physical systems and their nodes of intersection**

The best way to correct a poorly laid system is to rebuild it with a better layout, however for physical systems this is often hard to do.

9. **Delays : The length of time relative to the rates of system changes**

Intervening on delays can make the system more or less stable:

- Too short delays cause overreaction
- Too long delays cause damped, sustained or exploding oscillations


8. **Balancing feedback loops : Strength of the feedback relative to the impacts they are trying to correct**

Make sure the goal of the feedback loop is correctly set (right goal). If the impact of the loop is important, make sure that the feedback information is strong (no noise polluting the clarity of the information). Make sure as well that the loop has enough power to correct the system in the designed range (ex: a thermostat is useless when the room has open windows)

7. **Reinforcing feedback loops : Strength of the gain of the loop**

Sometimes it is better for the whole system to slow down the growth rate of the loop

6. **Information flows : the structure of who does and who does not have access to information**

Here it is all about creating new feedback loops/ removing useless or destructive ones

5. **Rules : Incentives, Punishments, constraints**

4. **Self organization : The power to add, change or evolve system structure**

3. **Goal : the power of changing the purpose or function of the system**

2. **Paradigms : The mindset out of which the system arises**

Always ask "What is true". If something you believed before is a foundation of the systems and reveals itself to be false, it will have huge impacts on the system

1. **Transcending Paradigm : Choose which mindset is the best adapted to the situation**
