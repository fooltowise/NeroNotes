# Greek and Roman Stoics
### Greek Stoics

- Stoicism started in Greece with Zeno of Citium, Cleanthes and Chrysippus
- Greek Stoics were interested in logic (they thought man's  distinguishing feature is his rationality), physics (to explain the world, mainly with a deist view) and ethics
- By ethics, one does not mean the modern sense of the word (ex: is abortion good or bad?), but eudaemonistic ethis, i.e having a "good spirit". Stoics are not concerned  with moral right or wrong, but with having a good spirit, that is living a good and happy life.
- What do we mean by "living a good life"? Be virtuous! Again not in the modern sense of the word. Chastity and humility have nothing to do with stoic virtue. For the Stoics, virtue means excellence as a human being, i.e how well one performs the functions for which humans were designed.
- To be virtuous is to live as we were designed to live, in accordance with Nature. For instance, we have the ability to reason. Zeno would thus say that we were meant to be reasonable.

### Roman Stoics

- The main roman stoics are Seneca, Musonius Rufus, Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius
- Roman stoicism has eliminated the study of logics and physics, and focus entirely on ethics
- Roman Stoics made a change in the Greek ethical program. Although the main objective is still to be virtuous, they added a second goal: the attainment of tranquility. In roman stoic texts, virtue is rarely mentioned but tranquility very often. Stoic tranquility is a psychological state marked by the absence of negative emotions , such as grief, anger and anxiety, and the presence of positive emotions, such as joy. For the roman Stoics, the goals of attaining virtue and attaining tranquility were connected, and therefore they thought that by being virtuous one would reach tranquility.
