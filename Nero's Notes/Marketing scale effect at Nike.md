# Marketing Scale Effects at [[Nike]]

[[Nike]] is so massive, they spend more than 3 billion in advertising and associating with celebrities and famous athletes. It represents 10% of their sales. 
If Under Armour wants to spend the same amount in advertising, it is going to be around 80% of their sales! 

As a result, [[Nike]] is able to command a much larger mind share, which becomes a self reinforcing effect. More people buy [[Nike]]'s products -> More Sales -> More advertising -> More mind share...
