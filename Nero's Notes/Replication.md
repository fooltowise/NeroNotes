Replication as a mental model teaches us that we don't always have to reinvent the wheel. Often a good starting point is what others are doing. 

Once you get a sense an a feel for the environment you can adapt to better suit your own needs. What we need to remember is that effective replciation requires enough structure and space to produce a copy, but enough flexibility to adapt that copy to changes in the environment.

Just because something has worked for a while doesn't mean that it will continue to be effective in perpetuity. Maintaining a successful appraoch requires an ability to grow and modify that approach as required (see *Auftragstaktik*)
