# When skin in the game does not work

Skin in the game is very effective to prevent risk in the first place. That is why we are generally happy when a CEO has a large equity stake in his company. The wealth and reputation of the CEO are tied to its stock, so he makes sure to steer clear of any obstacle in the first place.

**However, once a problem arises and threatens to bankrupt the company, the risk *increases* that the CEO will engage in fraudulent behavior.**

An example of this is the wave of [[Profile of Control Frauds| control frauds]] in the S&L industry in the 1980s when interest rates rose and made most players insolvent.
