### What originally attracted you to join Diploma?

I was approached by Diploma. I liked their decentralized approach, with a small head office and the individual operating companies being autonomous, to a degree. They were independent with clear P&L accountability so they could act quickly to what's going on in the market, with a light touch head office function sitting above them, bringing them together. I liked that approach because of my experience with larger companies. When you've got a big centralized function, it quite often stifles your growth opportunity with the smaller companies that are acquired. Also, the products and technologies resonated with me in terms of my background, so it helped me understand the business quite quickly.

Their approach to M&A is quite interesting, in that it was led by an understanding of the business, the products, the markets, and the applications, rather than being led by lawyers and corporate finance people. When you're developing a relationship with a potential seller, it's on the basis of understanding their business, products, and markets, and, of course, the legal and financial stuff. That was the approach taken when approaching potential sellers of small to medium-sized businesses. I think it works better to build that affinity with the seller when going through that process.

### You touched on M&A. How decentralized is Diploma, really?

Less now. From what I know, I think things have become more centralized. I think the companies are still operating independently, but there's a bigger center now in the organization.

### Do they still have their own P&L?

Yes, they still have a degree of independence, an ability to react quickly to the market, agility, and everything else, but there's a bigger center now. The company has grown significantly, so that's understandable. It was very decentralized, and we only got involved from a group standpoint when the companies needed help. If there was a specific project they needed help with or were struggling with and needed assistance from the group, we would parachute in and help out. Or if there were specific business improvement projects like an ERP implementation or something like that, we'd aid them, but generally, they were left to themselves. As long as they're hitting the numbers, of course.

### Deployment never used to make them give the same ERP, backbone in tech, or HR system?

No, we operated a consolidation tool. A group from financial consolidation would take the outputs from any ERP system, consolidate them, and present them in a common format; we didn't insist on any particular ERP system. As time passed, we started pooling like-minded businesses together in a particular geographic region, and it made sense to look at stock and things like that in different locations. Still, generally, it's horses for courses because some of the businesses have manufacturing elements. Most don't, but some do, and therefore mandating an ERP system that was probably overkill for certain businesses wasn't a good idea, so we tended to let them do their own thing.

### How would you describe the M&A philosophy when you joined?

It was very much a buy-and-build approach, targeting small to medium-sized businesses instead of larger transformational deals. The approach was to find companies that you could clearly invest in, gain some moderate synergies, and drive organic growth. We didn't go for large deals that would take a lot of risk. It was very much a series of small deals in areas where the business has done well but could do better with some investment and pushing to its next growth phase. Those are the characteristics. We were pretty straight on valuation models but then used flexible structures like earn-outs, we’d sometimes put in call options so we could get that attractive package together for potential sellers.

### Did you have a certain minimum margin or earnings for the last five years that you’d look for in a company?

> The criteria we were looking for were margins that were upper teens digits, double digits. If they were much lower than that, there was a path to get them to what was 20% operating margins. Typically, that meant that we looked at businesses that had strong gross margins. If you've got strong gross margins, you could do something with the cost base even if the operating margins were lower. If your product margins and, therefore, your gross margins are low, you haven't much room to maneuver. We looked for strong gross margins businesses, which indicates a differentiated product and service in the market against the competition. We looked for companies with a good track record of profitable cash-generative growth.

Generally, looking for companies with niche products and/or applications, and having strong, capable management. That was important because of the decentralized model. We generally wanted them to retain management. We need them to be strong and capable to continue that growth path but recognizing that they're now within a group construct which means they have to comply with governance and compliance requirements that you’d expect to see in a listed company environment.

Those are the main criteria. Depending on the sector, we also looked for opportunities for cross-selling, utilizing buying power, that kind of thing, but generally, all acquisitions made were made in their own right. They had to stand up in their own right. We didn't justify any acquisition on the basis of synergies. In my experience, synergies are always harder to get than you think they will be. I think it's more of a risky strategy if you justify acquisitions and the valuation money paid for the company on the basis of you will get these wonderful synergies in the future. So our philosophy was very much a case of look, in a standalone business, does it stand up and justify itself for that valuation? And then great, if we can get the synergies, enhance the margin, drive the growth afterward, that's fine, that's upside.

### Were these mainly distribution businesses with 20% margins or were they mainly product niche companies, product companies?

> Both; it's the same thing. They were value-added distributors of niche products and services for particular market applications. The overall philosophy in all my time at Diploma was around this value-added distribution model. I’ll explain what value add is in a moment. They were all essential products; everything that was sold was always needed. Whenever you get macro-economic fluctuations, the cyclical nature of economies, these products are always needed regardless. Different parts of the business were more susceptible to economic changes than others. Still, overall as a portfolio, it could ride out those peaks and troughs better because the products were always needed. That was the model. It was essential products and services. Then the value-add piece differentiates Diploma from just buying and selling product as a distributor. It will determine what value add means depending on which part of the business you're talking about.

Again, a lot of it is around stock availability, so making sure you've got it. You can't sell it if you haven't got it. It’s about monitoring, looking at usage profiles, ensuring inventory was adequately managed to meet the market's needs. But it's also adding other things to that chain. A couple of examples in the aftermarket seals area, for example, value add there means availability and responsiveness. Typically, the products would be hydraulic seals used for an excavator, a piece of construction equipment. If that hydraulic cylinder goes down on that piece of construction equipment, then you're out of action, and you can't continue with your project. For example, in the Hercules business in the US, we had a model where if you ordered your products and your seal kit to repair your cylinder by 7:00 P.M., you’re guaranteed to have it anywhere in the US by 10 A.M. the next morning. If we didn't have it in stock, we could manufacture those seals rapidly, put them in the box and send them out to the customer. That drives very strong gross margins because of availability and responsiveness.

On the OEM side of the Seals business, there was a much slower pace, not looking at next-day delivery, but adding various services. For example, an OEM will come to a Diploma company and say, I’ve got this particular product; I've got a sealing application. Let's face it, who's a sealing expert? Our customers generally weren't people that understood sealing. So they would come to us and ask for advice on the design, on the material selection for that particular application. Depending on what material you use, it will be compatible with the liquid, fluid, or gas that was being sealed, and that chemical compatibility is really important for the life of the seal. We would help them specify the material, do the testing on the materials, give them a certificate to comply, and then supply throughout the production run of that particular product for the OEM. That's kind of a high-level thing that was done. We would help them in the design process. We’re the partner in that process, and by doing that we got specified in. Once you’re in, you’re there for the whole production run, which might be a year, five years, or 10 years, with that customer.

But that derives different margin profiles. Of course, that's not as high a margin as the aftermarket side of the business. In things like controls, again, if somebody's buying wire or cable, rather than just supplying a reel of cable, we would want to know what their actual product was, and we could help them cut it to the length needed. We could then terminate that cable for them in advance, so it helps their manufacturing process. It's all of these add-ons that were done, so rather than just buying a simple product, you were buying a product that's partially complete, inspected, and quality controlled, certified, and so on to help the customer.

### What was the biggest risk to these businesses in seeing potential big downs in your revenue or margins?

Generally, it's very little risk, which is the good part of the model. In the businesses that we would acquire, as long as you keep your discipline regarding the acquisition criteria that I mentioned earlier, if you meet those criteria, and do your due diligence and it's executed properly, there's very little risk. The main risk, depending on how much we'd pay, is ensuring the company delivers on the growth forecast that's used to justify the acquisition and deliver the expected internal rate return. There are always the things like customer retention and supplier changes because, generally, there was no customer concentration with any of the businesses we acquired. You might get 1% of revenue from the biggest customer, but even if you did lose a customer, it wouldn’t make much difference.

Management risk is always a factor when acquiring companies. They'll say the right things pre-acquisition, but then post-acquisition things change. Ensuring we retain good management means they're still engaged to grow the company and incentivize them accordingly with a revenue approach.

### If you could estimate, what would you say of total revenue is recurring revenue?

That’s a difficult one. It was never measured as a metric.

### Capex versus opex? How would you measure that recurring nature?

Everything is opex. It’s not selling capital items.

### It's not contractually agreed, though, so it's more like run rate business rather than contract.

Again, it depends on which part of the business, which business, and which sector. In some cases, for example, Kubo in Switzerland, they've got long contract production runs that they're supporting for customers, but equally, they do things that are next-day delivery, so there's a bit of blend within that. It’s not recurring in the sense that some of it is contractually baked in for, say, five or 10 years; you could regard that as recurring. But a lot of it is run rate type business; it's the kind of business that you can look at on a sales per day or sales per week basis. It’s not lumpy in terms of revenue.

### Because through 2007, 2008, and 2009, they’d acquired some businesses to drive inorganic growth, but it seems like volume and price didn't get destroyed that much.

> In the financial crash, the main reason that Diploma did well is that they didn't destock. Most other companies during the financial crash said, let's destock as quickly as possible. We're not going to buy anything, and we're going to sell everything that we've got. Then, of course, when there was the inevitable graph where it drops rapidly but it balances out quickly, nobody had any stock apart from Diploma companies because the strategy was, we’re going to retain our stock levels. We're going to come out of this, and when we come out of this, we want to be able to serve the market. That's one of the reasons why in the 2009 and 2010 period, when everyone was coming out of the financial downturn, the Diploma companies did well because they had stock availability. People were desperate to start producing again and getting product out to customers, and they had nowhere else to go.

### Even at the heart of the crisis, it seems that they used acquisitions to boost revenue even if organic volume or growth was down.

That’s right. There’s always that approach of a combination of organic growth compounded by acquisitions, and depending on the timing of those acquisitions it will determine how that looks within a given financial period. Also, remember that the products and everything that we did was essential.

### How do you define essential?

It’s things that are always needed. Let's take seals; you can't do without seals. People think they're simple products. In some cases, they're moderately simple, but the material science is quite complex. We encounter seals every day in our lives, but we take them for granted. They stop things from leaking. They stop things from blowing up. Nothing would function in your car, central heating system, or anything you can think of without seals. They are things that are needed. If your product goes down or just fails because the seals have worn out, you need new ones if you want the thing to work. They are critical, and quite often they’re safety critical. Think about every sort of man-made disaster we can think of over the last 30 or 40 years, the Space Shuttle blowing up: seal failure; Piper Alpha in the North Sea: seal failure. Every time there’s an industrial accident with an explosion, it's a gas or fluid that's leaked out: seal failure. So while they are relatively innocuous and people don't think about them, they're very important to how the world and the industrial system work. Without them, we'd be in real trouble. People in the industry understand that they're safety-critical. Therefore, the price for a moderately simple product can be quite high because of the material science that goes into it and the criticality of those parts.

### Take the Seals division, for example then. I know they divide the revenue between international, aftermarket, OEM, and MRO in the US, but how much is truly value-added versus more commoditized trading in third-party brands?

The vast majority is value add. There's very little pass-through of basic, here's a bag of O-rings, here's 1,000, pass it on. If somebody wants that, they'll go straight to the manufacturer; they won't go to the distributor in between. It's focusing on niche specialized areas where Diploma companies can add value in that process. It can be as simple as a little black rubber ring or a very complex mechanical seal and a complex mechanical seal can be £100,000. These are used in the mining industry, for example, in Australia, where they’re going through high-pressure acid leaching processes, and this thing is sealing pressurized hot acid. You can see that’s why they’re prepared to pay that amount for it, and also the safety and criticality of it. There's very little of what I want to call the more commoditized pricing end of the market; I wouldn't want to estimate the market, but it's virtually zero.

### Back to the M&A, what would be the max? How would you look at valuations in terms of multiple EBIT?

We were pretty strict on it; we didn’t want to overpay.

### Is that from Bruce?

Bruce, yes, and Nigel. The pair of them were pretty strict, and they're absolutely right. We would typically pay between 5X and 7X times EBIT. I have noted, more recently, that Diploma talks about multiples of EBITDA and not EBIT, which is an interesting distinction; how much depreciation and amortization are in these businesses? I don't know, but we always used to talk about multiples of EBIT. We would talk about that five to seven, we had a minimum internal rate of return based on a discounted cash flow model that we'd run over a 10-year cycle based on some conservative estimates of growth and what we could do with operation margins, and that would determine what we'd accept in terms of valuation. Most of the time, there's a difference between sellers' and buyers' expectations, so we would typically bridge that with an earn-out. As I mentioned earlier, in some cases, we would seek to look at buying a majority but have the seller maintain a minority under a put and call option which we could then use and exercise at periodic times in the future. That’s often a good way to retain talented management we want to keep in the business.

### Let's say I have a business doing one million in EBIT. You'd then want to pay 5X or 6X, 6X EBIT and model out DCF. Would you model GDP plus revenue growth? How did you look at being conservative in those estimates when you modeled out the DCF?

There were a number of factors that we'd look at in market growth. The model was always, the message was GDP plus, revenue growth, but we were really looking at the market growth characteristics within each of the sectors in which we operate. For example, for Kubo, we might say, what does central Europe look like in terms of its industrial growth plans? What are things like the PMI indices? We'd get market reports about growth rates and always take that with a pinch of salt, of course, and assume a more conservative level. Typically, I would run a three-point analysis, or I'd do a most like case, so we'd have a range of what we would come up with and then look at the valuation in that context.

### Take Kubo, for example, 22 million EV was paid, then 2.4 million profit after tax. But there was a bit more of EBIT than amortization, so how did valuations change during your time?

They didn't. I don't recall the numbers, off the top of my head, for the Kubo acquisition. That was probably one of the slightly higher ones for valuations at that point, but it was a very high-quality business, and we could see a good path to scaling that business significantly. Typically, our strategy around M&A was what incremental things can we bring to the group, either new products, new applications for products, services, or entry into a geographic territory that we didn’t have in terms of coverage. Kubo had a very good central Europe location; it gave us access to the Italian, German, and French markets, and Switzerland being in the middle of that worked quite well. It also brought a number of new products into the group that we didn't previously have, for example, gaskets and very high-quality precision molded rubber parts.

### Would you use their warehouse and infrastructure for the other parts of the seal groups to get to those locations? How would you look to expand?

The main rationale was having that central base but being able to sell out into those other regions. Because the Swiss speak multiple languages, they're very easy to access geographically, and some markets are big enough to justify a presence in their own right. Ideally, I'd have loved to have bought a seals company in Germany but we didn't find anything suitable then. So the Kubo location seemed a good starting point for that process to better access those geographic territories. As I said, bringing on those other products and capabilities was also really important to differentiate what we had in terms of an offering and, of course, there’s the opportunity for cross-selling. Can we justify the acquisition on things like synergies and cross-selling? Still, there's a lot of opportunity to bring products and services in from other parts of the group and to sell Kubo's products and capabilities in other geographies by using that capability.

### Is that a very big benefit?

It's always harder to do than it sounds, but yes. We did that quite often, in terms of being able to cross-sell that capability. In particular, we replicated the gasket capability in other locations and started new product lines in other locations, particularly in the US.

### How did you look to finance acquisitions between their equity and cash?

At the time, the quality was always no debt. We funded everything from cash, which naturally dictated the pace of acquisitions in cash generation, building up cash reserves, deploying an acquisition, and then doing the same thing again. There was no appetite at that time from the board to use debt or equity to raise cash, unlike today, where we see things differently. It was always through cash and very risk-averse regarding debt.

### Why do you think the M&A strategy has changed under the new management?

> I think it’s clear, the problem is as the company gets bigger, the harder it becomes to move the dial. As the numbers of revenue get bigger, doing smaller deals doesn't make much difference in percentage terms. You have to start going bigger to do that, and I think it's clear that the current management wishes to accelerate that program of acquisitions and build a bigger group, which is the right thing to do. But what comes with that is larger, more transformational deals come with more risk. If it goes great, that's fine, brilliant. If it doesn't, it's far more exposed, particularly when it's funded with debt.

The old approach was a lower risk but lower potential return in doing a high number of smaller deals, so the approach now with this larger deal is potentially higher returns and potentially higher risk. That debt, from what I've seen, the previous debt that was raised for the Windy City Wire acquisition, leveraged in terms of multiples of EBIT, they seem to be well managed, they're not out of control; it's well within normal bounds in terms of leverage. The placing that’s recently been done to raise $235 million for the Tennessee Industrial Electronics acquisition, which I haven't looked at yet, for $76 million, that's part of it.

### You're raising nearly 10% of your equity. That's huge.

. I think it was 7.5%, if you share capital.

### Either way, that’s a huge amount of capital on top of what's required for the acquisition.

That’s right, clearly there’s a pipeline they're looking to fund – and of some scale – to be able to do that.

### What do you think about that strategy?

I think it makes a lot of sense from a placing point of view. If you're going to do an equity raise, do a placing; that is a very good way of raising the capital to fund that. From what I've seen, it seems like the shareholders responded quite well to that. The current climate, to me, is a riskier strategy, with interest rates rising and everything else, so debt's a different story. But the shareholders will always want to see a blend of equity dilution plus debt rather than having it all on the shareholders as debt. I think it's the right thing to do. I think there was a clear change when the new CEO came in regarding his approach. He's far more expansive regarding what he wants to do from an M&A standpoint. I can’t comment particularly on the deals that have been done.

### What do you mean by expansive?

Bigger.

### Bigger deals, bigger empire, everything?

A bit of both, bigger deals, more geographic expansion, focusing on particular territories. There seems to be quite a lot of focus on the US with Windy City Wire and this Tennessee Industrial Electronics acquisition, so there’s a lot going there. It seems Tennessee Industrial Electronics focuses on this expanding automation market in the US, which again makes a lot of sense strategically, so I can see why they’re doing it that way. But if you're going to start moving the dial on this business in terms of its revenue and profit growth, then doing a $20 million deal and adding $2 million of EBIT to the numbers isn’t going to make much difference. I think there’s a blend, from what I’ve seen.

### He says he’s doing smaller deals, as well.

Yes, there’s a blend of small to medium-sized deals and the occasional larger one, which, from a portfolio standpoint, makes some sense to balance out the risk of those acquisitions.

### What would you have done?

I'd probably be in a similar position to Johnny, regarding what he's doing. It also depends on the board's attitudes toward this kind of risk profile. Still, I think he's played a good balance between being more expansive and growing more quickly but not adding too much risk in terms of the debt levels and the business and everything else. Windy City Wire, I think from memory, was about 10X or 11X EBIT.

### It was 10, I think,

The multiples have certainly crept up. But if you look at the correlation between deal size and multiple, that’s part of the equation. You can plot the graph.

### You see a return in capital come down because of that. Where the arbitrage isn’t there and you're buying companies at 5X EBIT, and your equity is traded at 30X.

That was always the plan.

### It’s the beauty of it.

But bigger deals command bigger multiples as you get bigger. That has always been the way.

### What's so hard about scaling the numbers of small acquisitions?

You can do that. It's a better approach in terms of balance and risk. If one goes wrong, nobody's going to notice, but the management effort to do that is quite significant.

### But why is it? If you do 20 deals at $5 million, that's $100 million. And there are three groups.

For 20 deals at $5 million, it’s as much effort to do a $5 million deal as a $100 million deal or a $500 million deal. Well, there's a slight difference.

### Or half the valuation.

You end up spending huge amounts of management time trying to do multiple smaller deals. It's easier to do one bigger one. But of course, the flip side of that is the risk profile. If the DD is robust and the growth forecasts are credible, and we can standard behind them, then why not. There’s always that argument. We used to have this argument all the time about what is our minimum threshold. Is it worth doing a $5 million deal? Where do we stop? But also, how high do we go? Where do we think the risk is? And with a cash-only funding mechanism, that does naturally limit the size of the deal you can do.

### What did Bruce say was the limit of the size? What was the range?

We didn't ever come up with an absolute limit; we'd always look at the right thing. But the sweet spot for us was doing enterprise-value deals of $20 million to $30 million. That was the ideal size.

### It's still quite big, though. Did you have private equity bidding as well, on those types of deals?

Our strategy was always to find companies not on the market. We did it through relationships, through networks. Typically, I would get to know a company that may not be for sale. You get to know them, then three years later, they knock on the door and say we're ready to sell now. Can we have a conversation? It was very rare that we saw a company comes through a broker with an information memorandum.

### You never really used to do that?

A couple came through that we looked at, but we were never typically up against PE houses and things like that where they were driving higher multiples.

### Thinking about scaling smaller acquisitions again. The business unit heads, can those guys who run the unit not do the acquisitions?

No.

### Why not?

These guys are good at running the business. They're good at running the warehouse, and they're good at supporting their customers, having internal sales, CRM systems, and doing all that great stuff. They might be able to do the initial find the business and have a quick chat, but as soon as it starts getting into initial offers, heads of agreement, and due diligence, they don't understand how that works and nor would we want them to. Depending on how confidential it is, we typically get them involved in the commercial due diligence. If there was a particular specialism and we needed somebody who understood that market and those products, we would get that management involved. But managing that process through to completion, understanding the complexities of the shared purchase agreement and the joys of warranties, indemnities, and everything else, you wouldn't want to get those guys near it. So we kept that at group.

### This leads to bigger acquisitions because only a few people are doing it.

That’s right. Of course, you could build a bigger team at the center to do more and more smaller deals. For me, I think a blended portfolio is the right way to go. A series of midsized deals, you'd have less risk associated with those, but with the occasional larger deals that make absolute strategic sense, they're no-brainers; doing that as a portfolio approach, I think, is the best way in. It seems Diploma is doing that now, from my outside view.

### How did you determine whether these are no-brainers? $76 million EV, 10X EBIT.

You have to look at historical data. I always look at that and first ask what market it is in. Is it a growth market? Automation in the US, yes, it's a growth market. Understanding their differentiated products and services and whether they are genuinely differentiated or it's just a me-too operation, so they've got that competitive positioning, that's important. Track record, look at the growth rates. For the last five years, if they've averaged a 10%, 15%, and 20% compound annual growth rate, what are the chances that it will continue? If it was bumbling on, they just had a good year, and suddenly, will it carry on in the future? Is that just a blip? Those would be the things I'd be looking at in understanding whether it's a no-brainer. But also understanding the margin profile. So making sure that the quality of earnings is what we think it is, and we can continue to drive operating leverage through that business to drive margins up in the future.

### How do you think the CEO of a company like Diploma should be compensated?

Probably more than me. That’s a very loaded question.

### I mean the structure. I don't mean the actual dollar.

I think a usual executive structure of a decent base salary to attract top quality executives plus a bonus that’s based on actual performance, in terms of financial performance plus other metrics. It’s not just about the numbers, it’s about the ESG and all those other things. And then an LTIP program that aligns the executives' remuneration with the experience of the shareholders. I think the old approach – and I assume it's still the same – was looking at adjusted EPS growth and total shareholder return as a measure, so share price growth plus dividend.

### Do you think that’s fair?

As a public company? I think yes and no. I think the danger is, at the moment, within executive directors in public companies, with share prices doing what they’ve been doing over the last few years and the volatility, many of those themes have not been particularly successful. There's a lot of private equity dry powder out there right now that could cause a brain drain regarding executive compensation within public markets. I think it needs a bit of a fresh look, but I don't think some of the external unaccountable bodies such as ISS and Glass Lewis are particularly helpful with some of this stuff. But again, I think the principle is right to align the experience of the executive directors to that of the shareholders. It can't be different from that.

### As you said, Diploma had that PSP plan, 300% of base every year, invest over a certain period, 75% is a three-year adjust to EPS growth. I guess that seems okay, though the leverage could impact that a bit, I assume.

Yes.

### Then total share return, as you say, could be challenging but is probably fair anyway. Should there be a return on the capital metric here?

I think that's more a bonus-related objective, year-to-year, rather than long-term. I'm increasingly seeing, and I think this is right, the LTIP having an ESG element within it, looking at sustainability being a key element, environmental performance, and that kind of thing. Making sure that ESG is aligned with executive remuneration is pretty important. Otherwise, incentive set behaviors, so if you don't have that in there, they will prioritize profit over CO2 emissions, for example.

### Do you think EPS is more affected than free cash flow per share?

I think EPS is a good measure overall. It's affected by the new corporation tax rate, which is not helping, but I think it's a fair measure. Again, free cash flow and looking at cash flow metric is more of an end-year bonus objective rather than a longer-term intent.

### What were your thoughts on the Windy City deal?

I don't know a huge amount about Windy City, so I think it was a big deal in Diploma terms; especially historically, a very big deal. Funded with debt; that 10-and-a-half-time mold.

### It doubled EBIT, I think he said in the last call.

Doubled EBIT, wow. Then, in that case, I think it was a bloody good deal. So it makes a lot of sense to me. From what I understand, one of the keys for that business, in particular, is that some very strong leaders took the previous owners to where it got to continue that through. Management retention and incentivization are probably key to driving ongoing performance in that business. Over time, I'm sure that, under Diploma’s ownership, looking at succession and managing that risk.

### Why did Bruce leave or retire?

I think Bruce had been there 20-odd years, and it was clear that he had been very consistent and highly successful. You reach the point where you've been doing that for 20-odd years – and he was heading toward retirement age – and it makes sense to exit and allow somebody else to come in with new energy to take it to its next growth phase. He took it from virtually nothing to a $2 billion market cap.

### How did he do that? In your mind, what was the secret?

In the early days, it was offloading all of the parts of the business that weren’t contributing particularly or weren’t core. Aligning it to those three market sectors, aligned to the essential products.

### Like trading businesses or commoditized businesses.

Yes, building materials and weird stuff, a long time ago. He came in with that remit and had a very clear strategy. The thing that used to bore every analyst presentation was hearing, I’m going to remind you of our business model, which hasn't changed. It's the same thing over and over again, just rinse and repeat. He was very consistent and disciplined with that. I think that what resulted in success was that he could incrementally do the same thing repeatedly and consistently with the same model, and it delivered. Of course, there were bumps in the road, as there always are, but it was pretty consistent as a trajectory. That worked well, and I think he got to the point where, after 20-odd years, it was time to wind down, which he deserved.

### Do you think, as you said, he didn't have any leverage on the cap structure? Do you think he should have had a bit more?

That’s a difficult question. I’ve seen examples of companies funding an acquisition program with debt and paying high multiples and then being found out pretty quickly when those companies don't grow. I looked at it then and thought it was the right strategy. I look at it with 20/20 hindsight and think maybe we could have taken on up to maybe 1X EBITDA. Not a significant amount, but something like that would have made some sense. Equally, you've got to have things to buy. There's no point in raising debt or equity unless you’ve got something to spend it on. Looking at our acquisition pipeline then, it didn't stop us from doing anything.

### Smaller in the revenue base, and you could grow with those five million deals, with five or six of them.

Yes, I tended to do bigger deals. But there were some at that sub-five million.

### How would you compare the 30 million deals that you would prefer versus the smaller deals? How would you compare the returns?

That’s a good question. In terms of relative performance, generally, the bigger deals do better than the smaller deals because they get more attention. I think that's the point. If you do Windy City Wire, it's going lead on itself and let it get on with it, it does command attention. Generally, sometimes if you buy a company for a million, a small company somewhere, and subsume it into another part of the business, it doesn't necessarily get the attention it deserves. I think there's a tipping point. You get to a certain scale where this has to succeed and therefore gets more management time and attention.

### But it's a balance because then you can start tempting yourself when you're buying these assets and saying, we can do this to it, we can do that, and then you start getting into synergy land.

Always avoid synergy land.

### Which is a challenge because you’re paying 10X, so you’re like okay, we can do that, we can cross-sell this, I'm going to spend more time on it. You better get it right.

Absolutely. We had a policy at the time, and I still agree with that policy that justifying acquisitions on synergies is risky, to say the least.

### How do you compare Diploma today to 10 years ago?

Very different in that I think the decentralized model is kind of still in place. The operating companies still work independently to a degree with group oversight. I think the center has become a bigger function, again, but it's a bigger business. There's more to manage, and it makes sense. Even when I departed the business, we were about 14 people at the head office dealing with a business with over two billion market cap, and we kept it light. We kept it light touch deliberately. We were a very disciplined, solid team; we monitored things closely and waded in when needed. But we weren't building bigger centralized functions, and I think the main difference now is that it seems there are more centralized functions within the business. And, of course, as we already talked about, their slightly more risk-based approach of going for bigger deals.

### It's almost like they haven't got much choice. If you want to grow at 15%, 20%.

Yes, it does drive you down that path. For example, you can do five or six smaller deals or one deal to get an extra 100 million in revenue.

### What do you think is the normalized organic growth for the group through the cycle?

I haven’t looked at market growth data in the particular sectors for some time, but I think you can assume upper single-digit/lower double-digit growth.

### It seems to be there, which seems to be high.

If you look at the market sectors that they're in, they're all growth sectors. Seals are driven by industrial OEM activity. If you look at the industrial OEMs, they’re all growing at double-digit rates, certainly post Covid that's happening. If you look at the aftermarket sector, a lot of that is driven by construction rates, so a market leading indicator like new housing starts in the US is a good indicator.

### If that turns, which it seems it might, how do you think that will impact Diploma?

If housing starts to slow, the activity within the aftermarket seal sector will slow. The business has diversified a lot in recent years away from just hydraulic seals for aftermarket, so that may be less of an impact now than it would have been, which is good. Typically, what's happening in other sectors offset that. You see a bit of an ebb and flow with housing starts and industrial OEM activities. And everything I'm seeing right now with industrial OEM activity is on the up. So that's a driver there. Medical life sciences will always have a nice consistent growth rate. Controls, a lot of that is driven by industrial activity levels within particular markets and a lot within aerospace and defense, historically. I don't know if that's still the case, but civil aerospace activity is certainly increasing significantly post Covid. Also, defense activity related to the defense primes spending a lot more on equipment now being funded by central governments to support a new world order after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It’s all those things together. Standing back from it, I would look and say, overall, you would really expect to see those growth rates in the upper single digit lower double-digit organic, and then compounded up with some acquisition on top.

### Powerful model.

Yes, it's a great model. It's just that constant buy, build, compound up, and go quickly. That’s one of the things I loved about it.

### What’s the biggest risk, in your mind?

I would say macroeconomics, as I just mentioned. There's always that factor, everyone's in the same boat there, but I think that's limited based on this spread of risk in the portfolio. The main risk is something we’ve already touched on, to move the dial, that means executing on some larger deals and ensuring that return on investment is achieved, making sure that they don't overpay for some of those deals, and trying to keep the leverage under reasonable control. If you balance that out altogether, I think the risk is relatively minimal.

### Is there any risk of obsolescence in some of the fasteners or interconnects, micro-controls? What’s your view on that?

Deployment companies are all very disciplined; it's instilled in them from group. This is one area we did get into in terms of inventory management, looking at usage rates and obsolescence risk in terms of the portfolio. In financial terms, I can only speak historically, it was always managed as a pretty risk-averse approach in terms of stock provisioning to make sure that we weren't in a position where we got big stock write-offs affecting the P&L. All the ERP systems that you use are pretty sophisticated looking at usage rates and reorder rates.

### These are also quite long product life cycles, right? Is there any risk that you don't spend enough on R&D, you're behind the curve, or you get out-competed by someone else?

The company doesn't do R&D. What it does is make sure it's well positioned to support the customers to do their R&D. They would be doing a lot of work on working with customers on future products, particularly in the industrial OEM side of the Seals business, so you've got the seals coming there. But to be honest, the technology in that space moves relatively slowly, so in terms of risk of displacement by some new technology coming in, it’s minimal, close to zero. What is important in the Controls business is ensuring that the business keeps abreast of technology changes in the industry more widely. Still, generally, they work with suppliers that are already doing that. For example, take the Controls business in the UK that works with TE Connectivity, who are leaders in that field. It’s their job to do the R&D and the deployment business's job to support the customers and deliver that product to them. I think that’s a significantly lower risk than most.

### Take the Seals business, for example; how did you look to price products in terms of the pricing power?

The maximum we could possibly do. Look at the aftermarket side of things. Frankly, when somebody wants it desperately, they want it tomorrow and we can command premium pricing. So gross margins were very high. And I think turning that sector, the ability to pass on input cost increases is significant.

### You do it quickly? Instant?

Absolutely, it’s instant. If our supplier puts the price up 20%, we can just put our price up instantly, no problem.

### And you say, it’s a supplier price increase.

Honestly, you want it tomorrow. If they bought that same seal kit from the OEM, it would be five times the price. If you've got a Caterpillar excavator and want to buy the Caterpillar seal kit for your hydraulic cylinder, it would be five times the price.

### Because you’re buying at scale.

There's plenty of headroom because the margins they command are huge. So that side of it is one thing. On the OEM side of things, it depends on the duration and nature of the contract. Most of the contracts will be baked in at a certain price with ratchets in them for inflation, so you'd have that coming through anyway, but it's harder to do that. You're more likely to get a margin squeeze on a long-term supply agreement with an OEM. But equally, there's always room for our suppliers to put their price up 20%, so we need to work out how we share that pain; that's the typical approach with the customer.

### How much exposure did you have to Life Sciences?

Relatively little. From a group standpoint, I managed the group health and safety risk, risk management, product safety, etc.

### The big Canadian business.

Yes, that's a really interesting business. I think the key feature of Life Sciences at the time, and probably still now, is that they focused on geographically dispersed countries. In places like Canada, the population is spread out all over the place, it's an affluent population with a longer life expectancy. Most medical device OEMs are American or German. In places like Australia and Canada, where they've got disparate aging affluent populations, how do they go to market there? They could go themselves, but it will cost them a lot. So they typically use deployment companies to access those markets, then there’s the value-add side of things like providing reagents and things like that. Overall, it’s the same thing, it’s essential, but it's very careful on geography.

### Are there any other segments you could enter or have thought about entering in the past?

The debate about having a fourth leg was continuous. Is there a fourth leg we can go into here? Generally, that conversation would come up, and we would discuss, and ultimately, we said, within the three legs we've got, there's still so much to go at. That's still the case now, even in the business as it is today. I think the problem is that you’re going to get to the point where how many larger distributors that are value-added are out there for acquisition.

### I’m surprised there are so many already. Where did you find them?

We kept finding these new companies out there, and we would buy them. I don't know if that may become an issue, but plenty of privately owned small to medium-sized businesses are still out there. The market is very fragmented, and there are still those to go after, as well as the occasional bigger ones. I think there's plenty to go after, still, in the three segments, so I don't think there is the need to create a fourth leg right now. Some things we did look at ended up becoming a subset of those three rather than a fourth leg in its own right. And to be honest, you'd have to do something sizeable to justify it.

### Windy City could arguably be a fourth leg.

It could be, but it's nicely within the Controls sector.

### When you say nicely, is there anything shared between that, or is it just a reporting thing?

Regarding synergies, do you mean, within the existing business?

### Yes.

There is some within it, but I think it’s convenient to put it into a reporting bucket that makes sense.

### Right, and then the management team can oversee that and take it up to the board and stuff like that.

It makes sense that we don't want to create things for their own sake. It sells wire and cable and things like that, and so does Rayfast in the UK, and that's in Controls, so there isn't a reason to put it in its own segment.

### What other segments were you looking at then if you were to move in one?

Things we looked at were filters, sensors, pumps, and various other areas. Valve was another area that made sense, so expanding out. But inevitably, we looked at the market dynamics of those, and they didn't fit the business model in many cases. You'd think sensors would be quite interesting in terms of more complex value-added type thing, but they were relatively low margin, which was quite a surprise for us. The company ended up doing filters, so that was part of the strategy. We found that valves were strongly linked to oil and gas, which is strongly linked to the oil price and cyclical in nature. When we were looking at it, oil prices were at the bottom, and it wasn't anything that we wanted to get involved in terms of that cyclicality.

### Looking back during your time, what did you mainly learn from Bruce and your time at Diploma?

A hell of a lot. He was fantastic, and Bruce was great to work with. I learned a lot about how to do acquisitions, how to run a PLC, and the requirements of being a PLC regarding governance, compliance, and everything else. So a lot from working with him and with Nigel Lingwood actually, from a finance point of view. So a great team; I enjoyed working with them.

### Any last comments? It seems like it’s a phenomenal business. If this business can grow high single digits organic growth, and lay on acquisitions, the return on capital might be teens, a bit higher, but what’s the limit for this business 5X from here?

I think it’s the availability of things to buy and the consistency of execution in that acquisition process. We will have ups and downs in organic growth based on macroeconomics that we can't control. Still, that is limited by the spread of risk in the business; it's just the ability to continue and then to build through acquisition. Building up that extra cash through the recent placing means they're in a strong position to deploy that cash and continue doing that. So whether it's 5X or 3X, who knows? But it's certainly got the opportunity to continue to grow strongly, in my opinion.

### Thank you very much for your time.
