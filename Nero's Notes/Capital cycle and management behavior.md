# Capital Cycle and Management Behavior

High current profitability often leads to overconfidence among managers, who confuse benign industry conditions with their own skills - a mistake encouraged by the media, which is constantly looking for corporate heroes and villains. 

Both investors and managers are engaged in making demand projection. Such forecasts have a wide margin of error and are prone to systematic biases. In good times, the demand forecasts tend to be too optimistic and in bad times overly pessimistic.

High profitability loosens capital discipline in a industry. When returns are high, companies are inclined to boost capital spending. Competitors are likely to follow (engaging in a [[Prisoners Dilemna]]) - perhaps they are equally hubristic, or maybe they just don't want to lose market share.

Beside, CEO pay is often set in relation to company's earnings or market capitalization, thus [[Incentives|incentivizing]] managers to grow their firm's assets.  When a company announces with great fanfare a large increase in capacity, its share price often rises. Growth investors like growth! Momentum investors like momentum!

Investment bankers lubricate the wheels of the [[Capital Cycle]], helping to grow capacity during the boom and consolidate industries during the bust. Their analysts are happiest covering fast-growing sexy sectors (higher stock turnover equals more commissions). Bankers earn fees by arranging secondary issues and IPOs, which raise money to fund capital spending. Neither the M&A banker nor the brokerage analysts have much interest in long-term outcomes. As the investment bankers incentives are skewed to short-term payoffs (bonuses), it's inevitable that their time horizon should also be myopic.

It's not just a question of incentives. Both analysts and investors are given to extrapolating current trends. In a cyclical world, they think linearly.

There is a lag between a rise in capital spending and its impact on supply, which is characteristic of the capital cycle. The delay between investment and new production means that supply changes are lumpy (i.e the supply curve is not smooth, as portrayed in the economics textbooks) and prone to overshooting.  In fact, the market instability created by lags between change in supply and production has long been recognized by economists (it is known as the [[Cobweb effect]]).

The capital cycle turns down as excess capacity becomes apparent and past demand forecasts are shown to have been overly optimistic. As profits collapse, management teams are changed, capital expenditure is slashed, and the industry starts to consolidate. The reduction in investment and contraction in industry supply paves the way for a recovery of profits.
