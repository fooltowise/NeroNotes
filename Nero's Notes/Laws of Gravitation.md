- Tycho Brahe was the first to suggest that we should measure the position of the planets in the sky to deduce the laws of their movements. He set up to document the movements of many planets in his observatory.
- Kepler analyzed this data and observed that the movement of planets followed three laws:
    - The planets are describing an ellipse in the space, with the sun being located at one of the focus points of the ellipse
    - The planets are faster when they are closer to the sun, and slower when they are the farthest. The exact relationship is that the radius vector of the trajectory of the planet sweeps equal areas in equal intervals of time
    - The time taken by the planet to do a revolution around the sun is proportional to the semi-major ax of its elliptic trajectory, to the power 3/2:  
    $$ T \propto a ^{\frac{3}{2}} $$

- Then Newton made several major discoveries and deduced major laws:
    - The inertia principle : If an object is not subjected to any force, then its trajectory will stay the same (same speed, same direction)
    - The law of mechanical dynamics: the only way to change the trajectory of an object (either to change its speed or its direction) is to apply a force on it
    - The force needed to give a certain acceleration to an object is inversely proportional to its mass. Another way to say it is that the force is equal to the mass times acceleration : 
    $$ \vec{F} = m \vec{a}$$
    
 Finally Newton had the genius insight that the planets were not "pushed" by something, but rather that they "fall" towards the sun, attracted by a force called gravitation. This force is proportional to the mass of the two elements and inversely proportional to the squared distance between them. This insight allowed to re-demonstrate the three Kepler laws. Newton then demonstrated that this force was not only applicable for the planets to the sun, but for _any_ couple of objects. If you have two objects A and B, they both attract each others thanks to the force of gravitation, equal to :
 
 $$ F = G \frac{M_A M_B}{d^2}$$ with G = 6.67.10^-11 N m^2/kg^2
