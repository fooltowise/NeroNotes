# Shifting current expenses to a later period
### Excessively capitalizing normal operating expenses

- Improperly capitalizing routine operating expenses
  - Watch for sizable increase in capital spending in cash flows from investing activities
- Watch for improper capitalization of marketing and solicitation costs (ex: "deferred membership acquisition costs" as an asset on the balance sheet)
- Watch for earnings boosts after adopting new accounting rules (promulgated by the standard setters)
- Be wary of unusual asset accounts on the balance sheet
- Watch for an increase in software capitalization
- Watch for growing advances and prepayments
- **Improper capitalization of costs also inflates operating cash flow**

### Amortizing costs too slowly

- Be alert for boosts to income by stretching out the amortization period
- Be particularly wary of big income boosts from stretching out depreciable lives
- Be alert for slow amortization of inventory costs (especially when the accounting used is a "**program method**" with the provision for COGS lying as an asset on the balance sheet)

### Failing to write down assets with impaired value

- watch for an unexpected inventory buildup. Monitor this with DSI (Days sales of inventory = inventory/ cost of goods sold *365)

### Failing to record expenses for uncollectible receivables and devalued investments

- Watch for a decline in bad debt expense. When all the reserve accruals are moving in the wrong direction (i.e declining), run for the hill!
- Watch for a decline in allowance for doubtful accounts
- Watch for a decline in loan loss reserves. **red flag: loan loss reserves decline relative to bad (nonaccrual or nonperforming) debt**
- Be extra cautious when companies lend money to their own customers, to ensure that the company is not boosting sales by lending to customers that wont be able to pay back their loans
- Watch for tricks to make losses from impaired assets disappear
