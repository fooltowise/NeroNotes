## Factors driving EXPI's competitive advantage

- Bits of [[Network Effects]]: A new agent entering the network means more revenues to share for existing agents
- Scale Economics shared (to a certain extent) the more agents do real-estate transactions, the more EXPI reduces its commissions, which leads to lower fees for real-estate buyers and sellers and thus more transactions.
- Great [[corporate culture]]:
	- The company makes sure that its direct customers (the agents) have a great deal: very low brokerage fees and a lot of sharing of revenues.
	- The company makes sure that agents also think and act like owners through their large holding of the company's stock
	- There is a self selection of agents: someone who wants to do only a little amount of transaction during the year will be better off in another brokerage company. Customers are self-selecting: only those who think they can do a large amount of business will select EXPI. **Talented agents will grow inside the company, for the benefit of everybody.**
- Very good understanding of the [[Superpower of Incentives]], coupled with operand conditioning: once an agent has a good experience with the company, he is likely to continue to use it.
- Glenn Sanford, CEO and Chairman, owns 30% of the company, and his wife 20%. The insider ownership is very high. See [[Owner Operators]]
- Decentralized organization. Everything has been virtualized in Virbela. See [[Decentralized Organizations]].
- Needs very little capital to grow free cash flows. This is very similar to a franchise business model.
