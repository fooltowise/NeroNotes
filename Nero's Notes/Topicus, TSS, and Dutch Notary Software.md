# Topicus, TSS, and Dutch Notary Software

by #InPractise 

### To give you some perspective on this, I have been a long time Constellation software shareholder in my fund, and we have Topicus shares because of the spin off, so am learning more about how that business works. Could you talk about your background at Van Brug Software, what that company was about and how TSS acquired you?

My background was that I started working for a notary where I was involved in IT. In 1986, there was no computers or software, only personal computers with DOS and WordPerfect 4.2. Later I got to be more involved in the business of Van Brug Software, the company I later bought in 2008.

### Good timing.

Yes, the crisis hit me hard and I almost went bankrupt in 2009. The banks saved me because we didn't show any red figures. At the end of 2014, I got a message from TSS via LinkedIn. I had never heard from them before; they were bought by CSI and were looking for niche markets and new businesses to buy. They were interested in the notary software business and wanted to talk to me, and at that time, I was thinking about keeping the company and not expanding abroad, so this was a step I could take. I had a meeting and it instantly struck me how they handled businesses they would buy, which were the principles of CSI adopted by TSS. At that time, they were recently bought by CSI, so I was the first company they bought after that. The whole transaction took three months because I'm organized so all the contracts and networks were in place.

They made me an offer which I accepted and, on 1st of April 2015, the transaction was signed with a notary and the shares were transferred. In the beginning, I stayed on as MD of my old business, and learned a lot from the principles of CSI, TSS. I'm a quick learner and eager to learn and I adopted one of the main principles of CSI, which was value-based pricing. I should have done that before I sold my company because I doubled profits in the first year. Profits were half a million when I sold the company and 2.5 million when I left four years later, simply by adopting value-based pricing, but also charging customers for development we have done in the past.

A simple example is the integration to the Dutch citizen registry. We did that for free as I thought I was helping my customers and would get more customers doing that. That was not true, but we kept it for free. Ramon Zanders, my manager at that time, asked me why I did that for free, and I was less reluctant to raise the prices as it was no longer my company. I had to deal with angry customers, but no financial issues for me other than a smaller bonus. I raised the prices and they all kept using that module. I was the king of value-based pricing within CSI, and did many lectures and presentations about that. I learned to look at my own business in a totally different way.

They have a reputation of buying companies and raising the prices in the Netherlands, which is partly true. What I like about TSS is that they care for their businesses. In the end, it's about revenue, but they do have a strong principle of software for life. Keeping your customers is more important than hunting for customers within your business, and with a sticky market such as notaries, it is an easy target. I like notaries but I pity them because they don't know how to explore their own market and make their customers understand why they need a notary. It's a difficult market but it's very important because they assure legal contracts; I know it's handled by a notary, so I'm fine.

### Going back to the transaction itself, my understanding is they present you a term sheet with their offer? Did they stick to that without there being a lot of back and forth, and they didn't renege on certain things?

> They said this is the offer, take it or leave it. I sensed they were honest, and later when I was doing M&A myself, I saw the file about the transaction of Van Brug and the quote from the director of M&A stated, non-negotiable, this is the offer. That is one of their principles; it's straightforward. Of course they want the deal, but if it's over the top, they never do it. As an M&A person, it annoyed me because I had a perfectly fine business for TSS, IRR of X minus one, but it had to be X, otherwise no deal.

### No deal. Were there other potential bids you were considering or just that one?

No, I had more after I became portfolio manager of four businesses within TSS – three with notaries and one with accountancy – and I was looking for more businesses to buy. I was less an entrepreneur and more an Excel guy.

### When you sold your business to TSS, there were no other potential buyers?

No.

### Why was that?

No options at that time.

### Because it's so specific and such a niche?

I was known within the notary business; I know the processes and markets. I also know the surrounding niches such as real estate agencies, so I felt comfortable looking to expand within that market.

### Talk about the notary business as it gives me an idea of the kinds of businesses TSS likes. Why is it a difficult business? Can you talk about the notary world?

There are very small and very big offices in the notary world. The top 10 is a different ball game, but there are 900 notary offices in the Netherlands.

### Just in the Netherlands?

They are legally educated so they are not good entrepreneurs. When I offer a new module to a notary and say I can give you a win-win, it will cost you €2,000 per year, but you will have €4,000 revenue. They say, but I'll have to pay you €2,000? €2,000 is a lot of money; I have to sign many deeds to earn that money. They are reluctant to invest because they have legal minds, are not entrepreneurial and have small offices with an average of 10 employees. You have to tell them a strong story and they have to believe you; it's a personal relationship every time. Mailing doesn't work; you have to go in person. Fees for notaries are no longer regulated. Where it used to be a stock fee for the deeds they signed, now there's competition between them which makes it difficult. They don't switch software applications quickly because it works. We have one competitor software supplier whose software is ugly but works, so why should they transfer to a lean and mean?

### You said there were 900 notaries in the Netherlands with an average of 10 employees; that's a lot of potential consolidation. Are these businesses also in Europe?

Latin notaries exist in 20 European countries. It's about Napoleon and his influence in Europe, nothing like the notary in America or Britain. When you buy a home, you have to sign a deed with the notary present, which is still on paper. I am now involved in a startup making a consumer platform for notaries, real estate agents and mortgagors, so I'm active in the notary world which is interesting because they are mandatory. They handle a lot of cash.

### It seems like it's not a hard business to get into with 900 of them?

Buying software for notaries is complex because of the real estate registry.

### I'm getting confused, there are notaries and businesses who sell software to them, which is what you were doing. How many software providers are there?

There are five software suppliers to those 900 notary officers.

### The software is complex and notaries with software are unlikely to change?

> No, which is why we are looking as a startup to RPA, because we are too dependent on software suppliers if they are willing to communicate with our API. Now we are looking at RPA to get the data of the consumer in the system of the notary. That's because they are looking out for their own businesses, so I don't blame them.

### When you stayed on as an MD of your business and started looking for other businesses to acquire, did you find the same things you had in your business? You said you learned about value-based pricing and charging customers for development; did you bring those principles to the businesses you acquired, then revenues went up?

> Yes, I supported the M&A department by giving them prospective businesses to buy. I told my story because I was still enthusiastic about TSS principles. Last week, I spoke with someone in the M&A world who was looking at a company to sell to TSS. I asked if the founder was selling his company and if he had enough money? That was the case and if he was looking out for his company, clients and personnel, he should consider selling to TSS. I strongly believe that, and when I sell the company that I have now started in five years, I would consider selling to TSS. They do not pay the highest prices but look out for the company. I like the principle of software for life, and they do not buy a company then sell it five years later. They never sell their companies, so it gives me a good feeling to have sold my company to them because it's still there. They are doing great with all the principles I started and my successor carried on with.

### You mentioned you had an advantage at TSS because you were Dutch. Did you have a lot of competition for businesses you wanted to buy when you were at TSS?

Yes, it was hell. I'm an entrepreneur in the genes, but if you make contact with a company and meet for coffee to tell them about TSS, it's a long road to buy the company. TSS contact 100 companies but only buy one, which is not for me. My leaving TSS was forced because I had a new manager who thought my term was up; five years and he kicked me out. No hard feelings towards TSS, only to that person. He handled me wrong but shit happens.

### Did the other managers of businesses you acquired typically stay or leave?

One sold and later on I hired him and he's still within TSS. I lost two MDs, but that's what happens because half the MDs leave in the short term. In accountancy, I had a software company called CreAim, whose owner sold and stayed on as MD. He didn't think it was necessary to report monthly, and left because he couldn't cope. The mother company CSI is publicly listed so there are legal obligations. I had the discussion with him and told him if he didn't comply, he would have to leave. The next day, he gave me his notice and left the company. It took me five years to be kicked out, but the lessons TSS taught me help me find investors for my startup as I have a business case.

I learned from TSS to be in the middle of the owner, investor and entrepreneur. I was a typical entrepreneur with a good idea I wanted to build and sell to our customers. Now I first ask the customers if they will sign for it and pay for it, and when they say yes, we build it. On the other hand, I'm listening to myself as a startup; we are building a product which we are going to sell. What I'm saying is not completely true, but as a whole it's a very good principle. When you look at MDs within companies owned by TSS and CSI, the principles are good, but new initiatives or startups are out of scope which is where they are missing out on good opportunities.

If I went to my old company as the portfolio manager with a startup, it's non-existent, innovative and you could integrate it into your software and get revenues from it, but I got a list of things I had to apply to, and they were in the template to tell TSS why they should invest in that module. I was trying to integrate with them but that is too rigid, and they miss out on opportunities as a result. Revenues are great, as are their shares, so who am I to complain about it, but sometimes they smash the entrepreneur side out of you which is a shame, because people within TSS told me I was one of few entrepreneurs there, which is not a good thing.

### TSS and Topicus say they operate on a decentralized model, but when they take over a business, they say you have to certain things or you are out. How much autonomy do you have when you become part of the business?

> Businesses have autonomy and MDs make their own decisions, but they have to report everything. New initiatives are entered into a template, and it needs permission from the top to run it. You can raise prices but if it affects revenues, you need permission, whereas you can change the building you rent or hire new personnel without permission. They employ an 18 month rolling forecast. We bought a competitor of my old company and I thought I could integrate Van Brug modules, but I failed with that. Revenues were sometimes low and each month for three years I was asked why I didn't follow up on my promise. It is all about reporting figures and you are constantly checked. The templates you complete are combined with bigger templates which go to CSI. Mark Leonard knows my KPIs better than I do.

I once went to Canada to talk about Van Brug's transaction-based pricing, and he spent five hours because he wanted to learn from a small Dutch entrepreneur's value-based pricing principles. He gave tips and listened to me, which made an impact because of who he is. I enjoyed the boss sitting at the table in his t-shirt with this big beard, joining the conversation.

### That's fascinating; did you have any other interactions with him?

Yes. One of the CSI TSS principles which is not in the books is learning from each other. I presented my story to possible acquisitions and those we acquired. I learned from them and they learned from my mistakes. I never had a problem speaking about my mistakes, especially before TSS, about having modules without revenue. I often spoke with other MDs and portfolio managers.

### Your business was successful so it was a good template for them?

I learned that my company was the first Ramon Zanders bought within TSS. I doubled the profits and IRR skyrocketed, but he didn't like the business to start with.

### Do you have any interactions with Robin, the CEO?

The first time I met him, there were 12 Dutch MDs in a small room of 25 people. Today there will be hundreds of MDs due to their European acquisitions. They now have TSS Blue and TSS Public, but in the beginning, I interacted with Robin van Poelje.

### What was your impression on him as a leader and CEO?

He is a great leader on the business side and presents the principles well. There was always competition and he was in the top three, along with Han Knooren, whereas Ramon was never great at presenting. Robin was a nice guy to talk to, but when I left the company and I sent an email thanking everyone for their cooperation, he never responded. When you are out, you're out, and when you are not, he can be tough on you if your results are down. It's not a bad thing but it reflects on him personally.

> I once had lunch with him and he asked me for a tip. I told him we should be more proud of being part of TSS because our results were great and our customers were happy, and the moment I said proud, I lost him. The CEO and group CEOs drive average cars like an Audi A4, not too fancy, because we have to look normal. We have to be in a normal building without receptionists because that costs money. On my first visit to TSS, I waited in the kitchen where everyone was eating lunch; that was my first impression, so being proud of their accomplishments is not the case. They never outwardly boast about how successful they are, which is not for me.

### I'm curious how the compensation worked when you were an MD. Could you make a lot of money and what metrics did they focus on?

When your revenues are stagnant, you lose your bonus. My salary was €150,000 and my bonus was once €250,000 when my businesses performed well. That cost me my job because my new manager thought he could use that bonus.

### Were bonuses based on anything other than sales?

They awarded bonuses mainly based on recurring revenues.

### It's all about revenues because it's very high margin.

Yes, of course it's important to lower your costs which will help your bonus, but 80% was based on recurring revenue growth, then you received nice bonuses.

### When you were an MD doing M&A, did you go outside the Netherlands?

They asked me to go abroad which sounds exciting to be in Rome on Tuesday and Poland on Thursday, but smaller Dutch businesses in the legal and financial market sufficed.

### Would other MDs do that?

Yes, because it's about growth within HR. It's difficult not to grow as an MD or an employee of TSS, because if you don't comply, you are left behind. At one point, I was happy, I got nice bonuses and my companies won prizes within TSS, so no worries. Do I want to buy companies? It's interesting to look at other companies but I'm okay. That didn't help either, because they constantly look at your potential, and you can easily be dropped if you don't continue to grow.

### There's a difference in organic growth rates between TSS and Constellation and TSS is always better; it sounds like the TSS culture drove increasing those revenues?

CSI wasn't that strong in Western Europe, and TSS had a whole market to expand and acquire businesses. I'm not that up to speed but I see many acquisitions on LinkedIn. Within the businesses, organic growth is always possible, and that's how they acquire businesses. I was often frustrated when I found a company with 18% IRR, but it was too expensive for them and there weren't enough possibilities to grow. They buy companies with growth potential, unseen by the owner. They choose business which are easy to buy and grow. I don't know if they will grow forever, which is possibly why they bought Topicus, to try out a completely different culture than that of CSI.

### How are they different?

> Before Topicus was acquired by CSI, if you wanted to do a new initiative, you would go to Topicus because the culture is different. I was surprised when TSS bought Topicus and I thought it wouldn't work because of the culture clash. Old colleagues have told me the TSS culture lies with Han Knooren and Ramon Zanders, so their companies remain CSI companies. I don't know how it works with the old Topicus because I know there are some funding possibilities for new initiatives within Topicus. I was telling my children that investors invested €1,5 million into my startup, which translates into a company valuation of €3 million. We have no revenues, so if I approached TSS, the company would have no value.

### That is different.

It's been two years since they acquired Topicus; I should have a cup of coffee with Ramon Zanders because I'm curious.

### I've heard Topicus has more of a willingness to experiment, but I didn't understand it as much until you talked about it. I also heard they have appetite to do bigger deals than TSS.

Yes, they want pink elephants, the big acquisitions, not Van Brug.

### You mentioned their ability to grow forever but nothing grows forever. When you were there, did you feel like there were many M&A targets?

Yes, there's a long list of targets but there are no easy buys from the TSS perspective because they do not pay the highest prices. They have to be able to make the company grow and have a high IRR.

### Is there something we haven't talked about which might be worth knowing?

No, I look back at a great company I sold my company to, and I learned a lot. I left in a bad way, but it's about the principles and the dashboards.

### It sounds like there are new companies being created all the time, so there's new targets, and you may sell again at some point.

Yes but I have to be in business four years before they will be interested. An M&A person already contacted me to have a cup of coffee in future. He was linked to me in the software environment as they fill in all the targets, and he had to make sure he drinks coffee with me every year. I was laughing because I'm already a target. They stay in contact with the entrepreneur or owner so that when he wants to sell, he thinks of TSS, which is a lot of work.

### Thank you, this was very helpful, really good information.

Good to hear.
