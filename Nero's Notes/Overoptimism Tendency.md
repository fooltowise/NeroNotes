# Overoptimism Tendency

About three centuries before the birth of Christ, Demosthenes, the most famous Greek orator, said: "What a man wished, that also will he believe."

Demosthenes, parsed out, was thus saying that man not only simple, pain-avoiding psychological denial but also an excess of optimism  even when he is already doing well.

The Greek orator was clearly right about an excess of optimism being the normal human condition, even when pain or the threat of pain is absent. Witness happy people buying lottery tickets or believing that credit-furnishing, delivery-making grocery stores  were going to displace a great many super-efficient cash-and-carry supermarkets.

One standard antidote to foolish optimism is trained, habitual use of the simple probability math of Fermat and Pascal, taught in my youth to high school sophomores. The mental rules of thumb that evolution gives you to deal with risk are not adequate. They resemble the dysfunctional golf grip you would have if you relied on a grip driven by evolution instead of golf lessons.
