# Partial Monopolies
Broken competition occurs when competition exists in part of the marketplace but not all of it. The most common place of broken competition is localized supremacy: when a company enjoys dominance in some regions, but not others. Consequently, assessing market share on a country-by-country basis is often more illuminating than looking at aggregate global market share figures.

Take the beer industry. Ambev's stellar Ebitda margins in Brazil - comfortably above 50% - reflects its insuperable position in this market, itself a function of significant logistical barriers to entry.  Contrast with Heineken, which, despite enjoying leading positions in many countries in Western Europe, generally faces at least one other strong competitor in each location. The result is a materially lower margin profile than Ambev.

Another form of broken competition is linked to [[Switching costs]]. This occurs when a customer buying one upfront product, such as a razor or a software package, gives the producer something close to a monopoly by purchasing additional products such as replacement razor cartridges or software upgrades. For some companies, the economics of partial monopoly are so compelling that there is a greater value in the back-end than in the front-end (See also [[Front Book, Back Book]]).

The extent of the attraction depends on the competition for the sale of the upfront product. If the upfront market is highly competitive, then most of the back-end monopoly subsidizes the upfront purchase. Consider cell phone service providers, where front end competition led most to give cell phones to users for free, becoming a 100% user acquisition cost. 

Contrast this with the compressor market.  In addition to excellent service margins, market leader Atlas Copco also achieves solid margins on original equipment pieces. The combination has allowed Atlas Copco to sustain high return on capital and strong operating margins for many years, despite the cyclicality of its end-markets.

**The investor should always try to evaluate why an industry may develop along the cell phone model or the compressor model.**
