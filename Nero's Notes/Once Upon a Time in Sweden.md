# Once upon a time in Sweden
## by [[Demesne Investments]]

In 1906, a young Swede named Arvid Bergman and his German friend Fritz Beving formed a company they named Bergman & Beving. These two young engineers had been classmates and work colleagues in Germany around the turn of the century. At the time, they were witnessing the rapid industrialization and technological advancements led by England and Germany. Sweden, on the other hand, lagged behind, but that’s where they saw a business opportunity. The concept was simple – import and distribute the new technical products being developed abroad into Sweden.

Their first supplier was a company called Carl Schenk, whose automatic scales proved to be a hit. Slowly but surely, Bergman & Beving continuously expanded their catalogue and supplier base into various other specialty measuring instruments, and increasingly into adjacent technical products. For example, in the 1920s, the company began offering ultraviolet lamps, spectrographs, microscopes, mavometers, and vacuum pumps. In 1941, the firm began distributing Radiometer’s pH measurement equipment, a partnership that still exists to this day at Bergman & Beving’s life sciences-focused successor company, Addlife.

The company has progressed in this manner for over a century, methodically expanding into different product areas, adding technical services, moving into foreign markets, and even manufacturing its own niche products. In 2001, the company split into three roughly equal-sized companies - Bergman & Beving, Addtech, and Lagercrantz. In recent years two more companies were spun out - Addlife and Momentum Group.

It is difficult to summarize the breadth of products now sold by these five companies across a total of over 200 underlying subsidiary businesses, but I’ll attempt to outline them in the broadest of strokes: Addtech, Addlife, and Lagercrantz each distribute technical niche products, components, and related services, including their own brands. Addtech focuses primarily on industrial and infrastructure customers, Addlife focuses on the life sciences, and Lagercrantz focuses on electronics and communications. Bergman & Beving (now the smallest of the five) owns a number of tools, fastenings, workwear, and building products brands. Momentum Group, the newest of the bunch, is Bergman & Beving’s largest customer, acting as a reseller of
such products.

Thankfully for shareholders, the proliferation in Bergman and Beving’s product lines and independent companies has also proliferated value. The chart below shows the cumulative total return of the combined Bergman & Beving complex from the beginning of 2001 (the year it split into three pieces) through March 13, 2020. The combined annualized compounded total return over this period is ~17% , an impressive measure by nearly any standard.

For Bergman & Beving, it is hard to overstate how much has changed since 1906, both within the company and the world around it. Arvid Bergman and Fritz Beving, as ambitious as they were, could not possibly have foreseen how far their humble 
partnership would evolve. Most of the products these companies sell today hadn’t even been invented when they set out! However, it would be wrong to repeat the old saying that “the only constant is change.” It is just as instructive to take note of what did not change. Foremost among them is a commitment to entrepreneurial decentralization. The official history of the company dates the inception of the decentralized model to the World War II era. Facing labor shortages due to the war,
Bergman, Beving, and Knut Stenberg (who had joined as the third partner), divvied up the products between themselves, with each taking full responsibility of their own product groups and suppliers. Other resources were shared. The implementation and approach certainly underwent refinement and evolution (which continues to this day), but continuously strengthened over the years. See, for example, what Bergman & Beving wrote in its 2001 annual report, just before the simultaneous spinoffs of Addtech and Lagercrantz:
>The Bergman & Beving Group is permeated by a belief in decentralization, where the ability and will of its employees drive the business forward within set requirements for earnings growth, profitability and development. Bergman and Beving’s corporate philosophy can be summarized in five key words: 
>**Simplicity** is an all-embracing concept. Co-workers are encouraged to work with as little paper and as few reports and meetings as possible.
>**Efficiency** is a matter of doing the right things and of doing things right. Spending time on finding those activities that give the most is an important priority for us to be successful. Our work is concentrated to our customers, with customer benefit as the guiding-star.
>**Willingness to change**. The Group structure with “small-scale operations on a large scale” allows us to modify the organization to accommodate the requirements of a forever changing world around us.
>**Accountability and freedom** go together. Without one, the other is impossible. Accountability and freedom will only work in a decentralized organization. Bergman & Beving’s organization is decentralized and decisions are made as close to the customer as possible.

We can see in this enumeration of corporate values how the decentralized philosophy was sharpened over the years. Those that have read Demesne’s previous letters will already begin to recognize familiar themes. Redundant paperwork and frivolous meetings are the hallmarks of bureaucratic creep and should be minimized. “Small-scale operations on a large scale” is superior to the slavish pursuit of “economies of scale” that characterizes standard management wisdom (Premium Brands and [[TransDigm]], as discussed in a previous letter, would agree). Freedom, accountability, and decentralization need each other to flourish. Customers cannot authentically be a company’s “guiding star” unless decisions are made as close to them as possible.

Nineteen years later, not much has changed. Compare the above excerpt with
the one below from Addtech’s 20196 annual report. 

>Entrepreneurial spirit and a small-scale approach are part of Addtech’s DNA. We run a highly decentralised business that combines the flexibility, efficiency and entrepreneurial spirit of small businesses with the resources, network and long-term perspective of a large corporation. Each company enjoys considerable freedom in choosing customers and its paths to the market, but also bears considerable responsibility to meet ambitious expectations in terms of profit growth and profitability.


In the interest of space, I have relegated similar examples from recent filings of the other companies in the Bergman & Beving complex to the Appendix. Though I have nuanced thoughts on which of these companies do the better job of adhering to decentralization best practices, the thematic undercurrent is present across all of them. The consistency in principles that we observe across the Bergman & Beving complex has unsurprisingly resulted in similarly consistent strategic decisions. Take the following two closely related tactics, for example.

### Proprietary and Customized Products
Bergman & Beving began life as a distributor, but all of its successor companies have an explicit goal of increasing the proportion of revenue derived from their own brands, proprietary products, or customized solutions. Some are further along than others. Customization is a natural extension of the customer proximity and flexibility built into a decentralized model. Similarly, decentralization tends to foster a movement towards
proprietary products because they tend to be associated with smaller, niche markets that meet specific customer needs. Such niche products tend to get overlooked in hierarchical organizations that because they appear too small to matter individually. Yet in aggregate, they can be significant not just in magnitude, but also customer stickiness, higher prices, and better margins. The catch is that the only way a large number of niche businesses can be effectively managed is by delegating authority to the periphery. By decentralizing decisions close to the customer, the Bergman & Beving
companies are equipped to identify niche customer pain points and address them either by building or buying.

### Technical Authorities and Collaborators
Technical expertise is a core competency for every Bergman & Beving business. Their customers have technical needs but may not know exactly how best to satisfy them. They rely on the Bergman & Beving business units to be technical experts who can advise them on which products work best together and are most suited for their processes. Orders are no longer just orders. They become customized configurations designed to meet bespoke needs. This is naturally intertwined with the aforementioned tendency towards customization and proprietary products. Decentralization enables the business units to truly be advisors and collaborators who become intimately familiar with customers’ staff and processes. Loyalty is cultivated
primarily because that knowledge and customization is hard to replace. But the loyalty between people who work closely together should not be underestimated either.
These are just two examples of common tendencies I’ve observed in decentralized businesses, and I’ll continue to highlight them as I discuss other companies. The Bergman & Beving complex is a rich source of many such tendencies and best practices, but I’ll only touch on one more in this letter.


## Splitting and Spinning
Before wrapping up, I want to address the conspicuous splintering of Bergman & Beving into five different companies over the last two decades. I don’t know the current verdict held by the quantitative finance literature on the topic of spinoffs, but I know that it has been an unusually persistent source of excess returns for a long time. There are a number of reasons proposed to explain it, but I think the most impactful one for long-term value is the sense of entrepreneurialism, ownership, and focus that becoming independent can invigorate within the company. It so happens that an inordinate number of Demesne’s holdings and prospective holdings have spun, or been spun, at some point in their histories. This is not by design, but it is not a coincidence either. Carried to its logical conclusion, a business philosophy built upon decentralized entrepreneurship will eventually merit a complete separation of a business under the right conditions. This is, in fact, the exact reasoning that Bergman & Beving’s CEO articulated in 2001 just before it spun out Addtech and Lagercrantz:

>The creation of three independent listed entities is a natural continuation of Bergman & Beving’s organizational evolution. Sales departments, or profit centers, were created during the 1960’s. During the 1970’s operations were incorporated in subsidiaries. Divisions were formed in the 1980’s and during the 1990’s operations were divided into business areas. We are now continuing this development by establishing three independent listed companies.

Similarly, there are some decentralized businesses which actively divide their internal business units into smaller ones for the same motivations. While consolidating business units may be a very sensible thing to do even in the context of a decentralized operating model, when I do see this kind of corporate mitosis, it’s a pretty good signal that a business is committed to the ethos of entrepreneurial decentralization. It is a strong indication that the business’s executives are able to relinquish power and are wary of pursuing economies of scale at all costs – two traits that are the exceptions, rather than the rule in the corporate world.
Even though both internal and external spinoffs seem to be a more common phenomenon amongst decentralized businesses than the general averages, it’s something I would like to see more in some of the more mature businesses I follow. It is by no means a deal-breaker, but I can think of at least several large, mature decentralized businesses that might benefit from it.

Finally, I’d like to make one final point related to the inefficiencies and opportunities presented by special situations like spinoffs. An attentive reader probably noticed in the total return graph posted earlier in this letter that value creation has not been distributed evenly amongst the various members of the Bergman & Beving complex. Indeed, it speaks to the value of knowing the history and nuances of the entire picture to be properly equipped to identify moments of opportunity within it. It’s especially true of the Bergman & Beving companies in particular, which have a combined market capitalization of less than SEK 35B, which is the US Dollar equivalent of just ~$3.6B9. Even collectively, let alone individually, these businesses are hardly worth the time and effort of much institutional investors to get to know.

## Lessons for Demesne

To summarize, here are the major takeaways for Demesne’s research process covered in this letter:

• **Persistence of Decentralization**. How long has the company been operating with a decentralized operating model? Where did it originate? Has the commitment to decentralization survived a regime change? Does the company or management have connections to other decentralized businesses?
• **Proprietary or Custom Products.** Does the company have a predisposition or strategic intent to increase the amount of business generated by proprietary or custom products? More commoditized products may well still have their place, but the proprietary stuff is evidence that the company is continuously looking to fill niche needs of higher value to their customers.
• **Technical and Relationship Selling**. Are the business units of the company authoritative sources of technical expertise for their clients? Do they collaborate with customers, even helping them design products or manage parts of their processes? This is something that decentralized businesses are built to do well, and hierarchical ones aren’t.
• **Spinoffs and Corporate Mitosis**. Does the company have a history of spin-offs? What happened to those companies once they were independent? Does the company actively split its internal business units to promote accountability and ownership?

## Closing Thoughts
In light of the fear that the coronavirus pandemic has incited across the world, I ask the reader to consider where the Bergman & Beving family of companies stands today in spite of all it has endured since its inception in 1906: Two World Wars, the Great Depression, the collapse of the global gold standard, epidemics and pandemics, countless trade wars, the Cold War, genocide, totalitarianism, oil crises, stock market crashes, global terrorism, and much, much more. Any from this litany of tragedies provided ample temptation to despair, because despair flourishes when we feel powerless in the face of hardship. However, Bergman & Beving managed not just to survive these hardships, but to thrive. It did this by empowering its people with the
freedom, responsibility, and support to continuously adapt, evolve, and better their lot. During times like these, the doomsayers may have the limelight, but the long-term belongs to the optimists.

## Appendix 1: Snippets on decentralization from company filings

### Addtech
>Entrepreneurial spirit and a small-scale approach are part of Addtech’s DNA. We run a highly decentralised business that combines the flexibility,  efficiency and entrepreneurial spirit of small businesses with the resources, network and long-term perspective of a large corporation. Each company enjoys considerable freedom in choosing customers and its paths to the market, but also bears considerable responsibility to meet ambitious expectations in terms of profit growth and profitability.

### Addlife
> AddLife is an attractive and responsible owner of niche companies. In our decentralized and entrepreneur-driven model, each subsidiary is responsible for its own business activities within the context of the requirements for growth, profitability and sustainable development set by the Group. The model creates leverage by enabling us to benefit from AddLife's combined resources, networks and industrial expertise, along with the flexibility, commitment and business acumen of a small company.

### Lagercrantz
>The operations are conducted in a decentralised manner, and each subsidiary is followed-up in relation to clear objectives. Therefore the degree of independence is high where the management team of each subsidiary can work with considerable freedom and own responsibility. This also means that critical business decisions are made, where they are made best – close to customers and the market. Each subsidiary strives to develop a leading position in a limited market, product/customer or geographical niche.

### Momentum Group

> Momentum Group has a decentralized organisation, wherein business decisions are made in close proximity to the customer and suppliers. Within the framework of the Group’s vision, business concept, strategic goals and guidelines, operating activities are conducted independently within the subsidiaries with accountability for earnings and profitability. This allows greater flexibility to adapt the offerings to customers’ needs. Through the total size of Momentum Group, the subsidiaries are supported by the large company’s resources, experience, expertise, contact networks and access to the capital markets.

## Bergman & Beving

>We rely on our decentralised organisation to develop, market and sell our products and brands, and our strength lies in our customer closeness in the markets where we operate. Our strong individual brands differentiate themselves through high recognition and high preference level in their target groups. Focus on strong brands and high-quality proprietary products is central to our strategies.
