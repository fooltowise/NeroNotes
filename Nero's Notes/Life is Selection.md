# Life is selection

The second biological lesson from history is that life is selection. Some individuals are better equipped than others when facing the big test of survival. Nature has not read the universal declaration of human rights, and we are all born with physical psychological and cultural differences. Nature likes differences as a necessary material for selection.

Inequalities are not only natural, they increase with the complexity of civilization. Economical development specializes functions and differentiates everyone's capacities, making men's worth unequal to their groups.

Nature smiles when it looks at the union of freedom and equality in our utopias. **Freedom and equality are two twin enemies**, and when one prevails the other dies.

Leave men free, and inequalities multiply in geometrical manner (19th century in England and USA). In order to limit inequalities, one must restrict liberties (Russia, 1917).

Even when they are repressed, inequalities grow. **Only the man with below-average economic capacities desires equality. Those aware of their superior economic skills want freedom; and at the end, superior capacities have it their way. Utopias based on equality are biologically doomed.**

The best a philosopher can shoot for is an equality of legal justice, and of education opportunity. **A society in which all potential capacities are allowed to develop and function will have a survival advantage in group competition.**
