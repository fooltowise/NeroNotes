### We are investors in public markets and are trying to research the online gambling industry – which is attractive because of growth – and, specifically, publicly traded players like Evolution, Playtech, and many operators in the US. It is a very interesting market because of the developments in Europe, the US and in Asia. We wanted to learn more about the industry and have been looking at Evolution for a while so we understand their business, but are curious to hear how you see the different industry players. Could you give us your background so we can understand your industry role?

Online gaming is not an industry you can learn somewhere; there are no universities to give you background, so it was all about experiencing different companies, meeting the right people and trying to put projects together. My background is very practical and hands-on. In 2011, I began as a dealer and learned the business from the inside. Two years later I left Evolution. When I joined Evolution, they were scaling and, firstly, adding language dedicated tables, which for live dealer is a big step towards localization. I was part of Italian speaking tables because I lived in Italy, but there was also Turkish, Spanish and other languages, which was new to the industry.

After leaving Evolution I kept consulting smaller operators. Coming from a European background and switching to Asian, I understood their different approach, player expectations and business model. In 2014, I joined an Armenian company and helped them to open a live casino product. They were very sports book oriented, but have a global presence today. They are an aggregator who also make their own products. It was initially focused on the tiny Armenian market which has a high percentage of gamblers. It was great to be both a supplier and operator, reselling products to other operators and markets. People asked us to open online websites in other markets but our product was not a good fit, so we integrated many other suppliers. That was another great opportunity for me to learn those products because when you integrate, you have all their documentation and can study the product as much as you want. The project was successful and today their live casino is huge. They serve many markets and have dedicated tables with Fashion TV. They were a family business with a lot of nepotism and hired people who had no clue about the business, who suddenly became your boss and you had to teach them, then have them manage you.

### Family oriented, but in a bad sense.

Most of the time, I would tell them what they were trying to do was wrong, or what a better option would be. There was a time when I had the freedom to create product, but once it was ready, many stakeholders would have nonsensical requests. At that point I left the company and joined Ezugi, who are now part of Evolution. Ezugi was a tiny Israeli company which were only live dealer focused. They had a shitty looking product which was generating huge money. Many people say that your product should look perfect, but Ezugi showed me that was not key; it was more about connections, how you sell your product and flexibility.

Ezugi did not develop everything in house, contrary to BetConstruct, who used cheap labor and had 10,000 people working for them when I left. Ezugi saved their resources because the Israeli labor force is very expensive. They wanted to sell it and have many connections, so they used many third-party providers. They would accommodate operator requests within months. When I joined them, the industry was changing technology from Flash to HTML5 and most companies were upgrading their live dealer product, which lives for five to 10 years. Usually, they accumulate legacy and become so complex that it becomes too difficult to manage it.

Matching sports book back office to live dealer back office was a complete mess, so we had to rebuild the platform to make it independent, but integrate back with the common platform. Ezugi wanted to kill Flash and improve user experience, and had five studios worldwide which required standardization because each independent studio had a different owner, so the quality and productivity differed, making it difficult to work like that. They had no developer team when I joined so we built a new developer hub in a cheaper labor market, to improve UI/UX and introduce new technology. We chose to build a new 2,000 square meter studio in Romania, which could accommodate 50 tables. We created new developer and product teams. Ezugi had already started negotiating with Evolution, but employees were unaware. We had a special project with the third biggest iGaming company to create a solution for them similar to what Evolution had, but with better commercials.

We spent one year deeply studying Evolution, and we got to their level of quality. We were very close to launching this project, then suddenly Evolution acquired Ezugi, which was unfair to everyone who had worked on it because we discovered we were fighting against something non-existent.

### Were they aware Evolution would buy Ezugi, or were they also surprised?

They were not aware.

### Were they not aware of their intentions?

They saw them as a threat, which is why they purchased them.

### I wanted to know why Evolution decided to buy Ezugi.

Ezugi was the first company who openly started copying Evolution, instead of reinventing the wheel.

### I thought the main reason they acquired Ezugi was to help them enter the US market and remove any potential competitors there because of Ezugi's license.

You are correct, but I am trying to show you all the pieces of the puzzle. Evolution were annoyed by Ezugi's behavior and started negotiating with them. Ezugi urgently needed investors and Evolution needed to enter the US market, so it was a win-win situation.

### Correct.

It was the first acquisition for Evolution, but I left Ezugi after that because I was psychologically upset. For me it was very unfair and because I was approached by Evolution several times to work for them, I knew their salaries and internal situation, and did not want to join them at that time, so I left. While this was happening, Pragmatic Play had acquired Extreme Live Gaming, whose owner and CEO was a former CTO of Evolution.

### Correct.

That gave Pragmatic Play hope they could catch up with Evolution. The code base was so old and badly maintained, that when I joined the company we started again. It was such an old product and operations were very inefficient as their live casinos were located in London, which was a super expensive location. Our strategy was to move it all to Romania, because, at that time, Pragmatic Play already had a studio with slots in their Romanian office. Their investors also had an office in Romania so we moved all the studio operations there.

We analyzed the code and quickly developed a first version, to show Pragmatic Play had a new product. After that, we simply killed that solution and built a new one on top. That was an acquisition of a live dealer company – but mainly for learning purposes – and we had to develop a new solution because very little of the code and existing business was useful. My position was head of product and we built a studio with all the operations, product and developer teams from scratch. Then we built the commercial offer and marketing strategy. Pragmatic Play is another Israeli company who are very pragmatic in their choices. Their former CPO didn't believe in innovation.

### Was that the one coming from Evolution?

No, it was one of the shareholders of Pragmatic.

### The one who came with Extreme?

Yes, they planned to keep him for a while, but got rid of him after a few months.

### That guy who came as a former CTO of Evolution with Extreme, is no longer part of Pragmatic?

He was never part of Pragmatic; he simply helped with knowledge transfer for several months, then they ended the relationship. He started a new business in Australia.

### Okay, perfect.

Pragmatic Play was in a new vertical and didn't have much knowledge so there was a lot of coaching them about what to do with the product and how to grow it. They didn't want to bring any new products to market and had a similar attitude as Ezugi did, who wanted to create proven solutions based on the leading suppliers, which were Evolution and Playtech. They would take what the best performing in each market and offer a more competitive price. The companies who offer more than one product can collaborate better, because signing new agreements with compliance, legal and integration is very painful. When a small company offers a big company a product, they hesitate because they need to make a new integration, but with Pragmatic it was a different because they have single point integration. Once you integrate with them, adding any new product or update requires very little integration effort.

### Does everything go through the same pipeline?

Yes, which is where Evolution understood they could not only go with live dealer, which pushed them to acquire NetEnt and Red Tiger. They understood if they wanted to keep their position, they would also need to have slots. Evolution are very smart and instead of introducing normal slots, they brought something new to the market. Evolution is an encyclopedia to the rest of the suppliers. They invest so much in data and when they move, we all know they will be successful, so you can copy them without hesitating.

### When you say invest in data, is that because they have more players compared to competitors and their data is proprietary, or do they pay for data access?

You need to understand what your end users are doing and you gather this data in two ways. Internally, you use heat maps and activity tracking to study their behavior. You also do AB testing, but if you have good relations with operators, they provide a lot of data. Evolution created dedicated tables in branded environments which was a success for them. They have a joint effort with operators to ensure their offering will be successful.

### Evolution will continue to scale and have more dedicated tables and better relationships with operators, giving them more data which allows them to innovate better, and everyone follows them because of that, and on top of that, they have the distribution network and introduce new games which are a success because of the data. Is that unique to them and no one can replicate that or have access to that data? Once Playtech, Pragmatic or any other player had a decent volume of players, could they get similar access to data and innovate and replicate what Evolution are doing, without being a pure copycat?

Any company can do the same if they have enough investment and courage. Pragmatic Play invests in live dealer, but don't have the courage to innovate.

### Why don't they have the courage to innovate if they can access the data?

They don't want to be pioneers. They never wanted to enter the US market. They never wanted to introduce new products which never existed on the market unless they saw they were performing well in other markets. Building a platform for live dealer is complicated because it has video streaming and you need to compromise to ensure you have a light solution which can perform on any user device. When you track user activity, it slows down the system, so you need to build it carefully.

When you have a new platform and try integrate with new operators, they demand high performance, which you cannot guarantee if you start tracking your users at the same time. New companies sacrifice this part in order to integrate earlier and have a faster product. Once they reach a level of growth, they can slow down acquiring new users and focus on growing existing relationships. This is the point when you start investing in data. New companies have no data and rely on what works in the market.

### That makes sense.

It is a compromise between performance and how quickly you can launch, while offering something the market will accept. Evolution has everything in this blend, which is why they are leading because they never allowed their platform to become outdated and old-fashioned. Compared to others in the market, maybe only Playtech is similar, in terms of timeframes. Evolution has passed the period where they are hungry for new relations, and can grow their data to understand what to do next. They have all those pieces of the puzzle.

### A specific question on the competitive dynamics in live casino in Europe, where Evolution has 70% market share of live casino for the past few years. Pragmatic is gaining share and entering the market with a good product and marketing strategy. Do you think that is happening and if so, why? Thirdly, what are the long-term consequences of Pragmatic not being innovative because Evolution clearly are?

Pragmatic Play can reach a level close to Evolution with their current approach. They are a games portfolio and quickly grow their product titles. Pragmatic Play built their studio from scratch in eight months. They have the potential to come to Evolution's level, but there are several reasons why Evolution will continue to lead for at least 10 years.

### Why is that?

Maybe five for sure, because I cannot believe anybody can beat Evolution. Let's see how it goes, especially with the war in Ukraine. To scale to the same level as Evolution, you need to have the same operational part. You can easily replicate software but it is difficult to replicate the effectiveness of their operations. I am talking about the broadcasting studio. Evolution currently has over 800 tables and this year there will be more than 1,000, whereas Pragmatic Play have only 100.

### Correct, 10 times.

Evolution have 10,000 employees, 10% of whom work on slots. To grow quickly you need to train people quickly, and Evolution has an academy for dealers and developers. They have their own school for training where they choose to work with the best talents. Pragmatic is not there and when somebody joins their team, they have almost no experience and need to be taught. They need to come from other live dealer providers to at least have some experience, so they don't have their own mechanism for growing talent.

### I imagine Playtech or Pragmatic would try to hire ex Evolution staff?

They do but they have to pay them double the salary.

### Do they have to pay double to get them?

Yes, because they don't have the same infrastructure. Working at Pragmatic Play is very stressful, and you cannot go on sick leave if you have responsibilities. When I had Covid, I was in hospital for 10 days and had to attend to all the calls, otherwise everything would stop. My boss was typing me messages, we need you in a call, please join. It was not human in some cases and there were waves of people like me who left Pragmatic because they were squeezed like a lemon and had no life balance.

### They are too aggressive, yes.

You start feeling something is wrong because you live with all this stress. Now they keep recruiting people from Evolution but give them stratospheric salaries, but it will take time for those people to build the same machine Evolution has, where they take any person off the street and turn them into industry experts.

### Evolution was first to build that infrastructure and have that academy, which the whole industry benefits from, so you might have to pay double the price but you don't have to invest in that effort?

Evolution does not pay high salaries, especially to the product team.

### Will they eventually learn how the industry works?

This is what is currently happening, but when those people leave, they do not have enough skill to build something similar. Scaling quickly to reach the size of Evolution will take time because you need to find the right people and build the right teams with all the flows and processes as you grow. It is challenging to constantly scale and introduce many new things into the market. People leave and you need new people who you have to pay crazy money, which is where Pragmatic sit.

### The second part of the question was around innovation; this was the first time I heard Pragmatic don't want to innovate. For the time being, they simply copy Evolution or industry wide games, but I was surprised to hear they only want to follow. How important is innovation in this industry?

Pragmatic Play want to become number two within five years of appearing, so by next year they will change their strategy, but until then they focus on finding what performs best in the industry and have that in their portfolio. By 2023, it is possible they will have enough product knowledge and resources to study data and figure out something themselves.

### Is that why you are confident Evolution will remain top player for five years?

They didn't want to become number one; they wanted to become number two, and are successfully getting there. After that they would like to have the leading position, but they don't have the same global coverage Evolution has, nor do they cover as many platforms.

### What do you mean by platforms?

Pragmatic have mobile and desktop with no solutions for terminals or mini games.

### Is that important or will mobile and desktop suffice?

It may define your relationships with big companies.

### Okay, got it.

This is another point why Pragmatic needs time, plus they are focusing more on the Asian market and are doing much better than Evolution.

### Why do you think that is?

They came into the market earlier and have much better connections, whereas Evolution only opened their Asian office six to eight months ago. Pragmatic Play has had their office there for two years and have very solid relations with huge businesses in that area. Evolution's product is purely European style and not what an average Asian user would expect. They want everything on the screen whereas Evolution has this clean Swedish approach, where what you don't need is hidden. Asia wants everything on the screen which is why Evolution is not well accepted, specifically in China where they simply cannot compete. They are leading in in South Korea and Japan, and have become popular in Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, who are more inclined to something international, and don't mind European style. In some of the countries they are doing well, and they declared 30% of their income is from Asia.

### Was that for Pragmatic?

For Evolution, but Pragmatic have a slightly bigger business there than Evolution.

### You said Ho Gaming was very different compared to Europe; how difficult will it be for Evolution to deliver the experience Asians want and how successful will they be with that effort?

In the current scenario, they need to create an entire new offering, dedicated to that market, but they don't want to do that because it would compromise on performance. Instead, they are promoting their product the same way Coca Cola creates advertisements which any reseller can use. That is very successful in Europe and will becomes successful in Asia as far as any social media channels can be used. If you type in how to win in roulette on YouTube, you will find hundreds of videos with Evolution Gaming games streaming, showing how to play and how they are winning huge, which creates solid brand recognition. For some players, if they saw it happening on Evolution and an operator has five different suppliers, of course they will be looking for Evolution because they saw it happening there.

Instead of creating something dedicated to Asia, they educate players for now. They created all possible live casino games from land-based casinos, then did game shows, which was a pivot point in the industry because they created it specifically for Generation Z. They know online gaming tends to be more entertaining and most new users never stepped into a land-based casino, so they need to create a mobile-driven product for them. They are very socially active and need to be entertained simply, because consumers want simple.

### TikTok like.

Imagine starting blackjack and trying to win, compared to playing a money wheel where you only have six bets and can cover all of them if you don't know what to do. They started that market and expressly stated in their 2020 annual report, that they want to continue creating products for new generations. They were first to discover it and the others simply follow them.

### One comment on their Asian market strategy, on their 2022 new games road map, half of those were specifically for the Asian market, games I have never heard of like Fan Tan or derivations of Baccarat.

The Southeast Asian market has all those weird games where they count tiny chips which makes no sense to Europeans, but they are very passionate about all those games. Ezugi cover the Indian market which is huge, and Evolution also have an offering for India, but they also cover Asia by offering European style game titles which are familiar to local players. Then consider that since they are entering the US market, how big the Asian communities are in Canada and the US. They need to keep the product as it is, European style, and try to fine tune it under the Asian style, so that they can easily sell into both Asia and the US.

### Would you expect the level of growth we are seeing in Evolution in Asia to accelerate even more because of that strategy and they are just starting to develop their operations in Asia, or will it be more of a long shot because there are many things to accomplish before getting to grow even faster?

Now they have RNG, they try to use that a lot. Their road map stated that they want to produce many new slots and game titles in live dealer. Slots is more popular and is two to three times bigger than live casino.

### Do you expect that to continue in the future?

Sports book is first, slots is second and live casino is third, then lottery and poker.

### And bingo, yes.

They want to ensure they can convert all those slots players into live casino, because live casino players are very loyal. I have friends who continue to play after 10 years.

### Do you mean loyal to the category or loyal to the specific games?

There is a human factor because they can talk to the dealers.

### I want to understand that better as I'm not a gambler. Is it that you are already within Evolution game and familiar with it and don't want to play other blackjack providers, or are you a loyal live casino player not wanting to play slots or bingo?

An operator could have three suppliers of live casino and hundreds of slots. A small percentage of players play both, but usually players prefer to stick to one game type because it requires you to learn strategy in order to win. Slots player who only know slots are usually much younger and their bets are not that high, so they play games they like and have played for a long time. A new slot will only be played for a few months. New slots are booming for the first three months, then their activity starts decreasing, which is why we have so many slots being produced.

Live casino players are very different. If a slots player is converted into live casino, his activity in slots decreases, but when he starts playing live casino, he will start talking to dealers and other players, and build a community which keeps people engaged. That is why life time value of a live casino player is much higher than a slots player, and even higher than sportsbook because sportsbook players only play during events, then they disappear. That is why it is a big task for Evolution to convert sportsbook and slots players to live casino.

### We cannot talk about game shows without mentioning Crazy Time, where the number of players only grows higher and it has been a huge success for Evolution. Will that activity decrease if someone else comes with a better offer, or will there continue to be loyalty to Crazy Time as there is on black jack or roulette which have been played for 100 years?

Dream Catcher was the first money wheel game created in 2018, and if Crazy Time was not there, it would be still be quite popular. Crazy Time cannibalized Dream Catcher which they would have to close at some point, but it was still alive, so the same thing will happen with Crazy Time and it will be very popular for five years. They will create similar games after gathering data and seeing what attracts players and brings in the most profit. They can see what players request in this game because with live chat you can gather a lot of feedback.

When I was in Pragmatic and I saw Crazy Time during Expo, I was ready with Speed Bonanza, which they released after I left the company. It was simply to copy the mechanism of a very simple game like a money wheel, and make it more interesting with bonus games from titles which were familiar to players. It requires one year to create such a game and so there is a lot of cost investment in it, but once you create the game, it will live for a minimum of five years, so you have very good return on investment. Lightning Roulette was the first game of this type, but now they have Korean, Italian and Spanish Lightning Roulette, so they keep the game alive with local variations according to specific regulations; it is a never-ending story.

### I'm trying to understand the sustainability for Evolution of that level of player. If in five years Pragmatic has developed more games and invested in data, what is the possibility that Pragmatic can come up with a Crazy Time which gets most of the players to come to their network, and Evolution loses that? Is that reasonable?

When Pragmatic launched Speed Bonanza, it was very similar to Crazy Time. They have three bonus games and the mechanics of the game are very similar.

### It's a copy, yes.

It's a different title but very similar in principle. They currently have 2,000 players whereas Evolution has 10,000, but it does not mean players give up playing Crazy Time and go to Pragmatic, because they have a community.

### Evolution acquired BTG and there was a lot of excitement because of the Megaways license they have in place, and on top of that it seems the Megaways CEO is an industry expert and can do a lot together with Todd Haushalter. Is there anything you can add to understand that excitement around BTG and what the potential is for Evolution?

Megaways is considered one of the most successful mechanics and, until now, most slot providers pay royalties to Big Time Gaming for using their logic. I am excited to see what they are going to combine with it. Evolution Gaming chose something popular in the form of NetEnt slots, which are one of the best in the world. Now they will take Big Time Gaming which is already famous, and they will transfuse Megaways into the live casino world. Other companies will simply follow, but they might have issues with Big Time Gaming because they cannot simply replicate the logic; it has to be similar but not the same.

### Will this excitement around the Megaways mechanic be sustainable?

Yes, I suspect they will launch an entire line of products which use Megaways, similar to their line of Lightning products which include Lightning Baccarat and Roulette.

### If there's anything we left out which is worth mentioning, let me know. If not, I wanted to say thank you for your time and it was a great conversation.

We've covered the most important questions to understand how Evolution will progress and what the risks are of other companies copying them.

### Correct.

I was talking a little left and right to cover my experience of different companies, but I believe more and more companies, especially during this pandemic period, we will have many new startups; at least 10 new live dealer companies in different countries. They will all try to copy Evolution, whose main mission is to increase the gap to their competition. Their existence depends on how big that gap is, so they will continue introducing new games and try to understand the expectations of new generations. For this reason, I don't believe in the next five years any companies will be able to beat them. They will all take small chunks from them. Not all startups are successful, so they will start buying each other and maybe Evolution will acquire some of them too. Forecasting for 10 years is difficult but knowing how they act, I can assure you they will always have something new, even in 10 years. Considering their scale and that they keep growing, I can say they will stay in the lead.

### I just realized we didn't talk about regulatory risks. Do you have any specific comments because there was a report which came out saying Evolution was involved in money laundering and let Iranian and other US-banned countries access their games; are there any risks there?

Reading that news is funny because everybody sells to Israel and Iraq because they are all looking for those Arab high rollers. We are not talking about Cambodia or China which are prohibited markets. Everybody works there so I don't believe there are any risks. Evolution noticed their products were played in Singapore where it is prohibited, and even after that, they released more Asia facing games. That answers your question; everybody does it and will always use the excuse that they are not responsible for what their resellers do. They will continue to invest in markets which are profitable.

### Playtech is also entering the US market but is there a real risk Evolution loses their license in the US market because of that? For Pragmatic it's not a challenge because they don't have a license in the US market, but Evolution have a license in New Jersey, Michigan and Pennsylvania etc., so the fact that they are entering those prohibited markets, how do you see that?

Evolution made many internal changes years ago in order to enter the US market. Some people had a bad track record which would prevent them entering the market. I am sure that if there is a risk of losing their license, they will easily resolve it by creating a new entity. They will probably try to acquire the live casino from Playtech, who is currently not so stable because they are being acquired.

### Indeed, yes.

Even if something like this happens, it's possible they lose their license in a state, but they will not allow this to happen because they have a lot of money and governments understand how much income it brings. I would say it's a very small risk.

### Many thanks for your time, ; I got a lot of insights from your side.

Thank you so much, if you want to go deeper into any of the topics, feel free to contact me through InPractise, you are always welcome.
