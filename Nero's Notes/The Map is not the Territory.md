# The Map is not the Territory
Maps have long been part of human society. The are valuable tools to pass on knowledge. 
Still, in using maps, abstractions, and models, we must always be wise to their limitations. They are, by definition, reductions of something far more complex. 
There is always at least an element of subjectivity, and we need to remember that they are created at particular moments in time. 
This does not mean that we cannot use maps and models. We must use some model of the world in order to simplify it and therefore interact with it. 
We cannot explore every bit of territory for ourselves. We can use maps to guide us, but we must not let them prevent us from discovering new territory or updating our existing maps. 
While navigating the world based on terrain is a useful goal, it's not always possible. Maps, and models, help us understand and relate to the world around us. 
They are flawed but useful. In order to think a few steps ahead we must think beyond the map.
