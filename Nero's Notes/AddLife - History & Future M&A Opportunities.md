### It would be helpful if you could outline your background.

I have a medical background and have been working in the life science industry my whole professional career. I've occupied C-level positions for over 20 years. I was at Organon for many years, which is a Dutch international company. I was then at bioMérieux, a French company and one of the biggest in life sciences, where I was a division director, then the CEO for the Nordic countries. I joined [[Bergman & Beving]] Group at Addtech in Sweden and was the CEO for Addtech Life Science for many years. When I joined the group, it consisted of 140 companies split into four divisions, one of which was life science. They were listed as diagnostic but saw the company more as a portfolio, so they split the life science part of Addtech to create [[AddLife]] in 2016.

### When did you join Addtech?

In 2011, and we started to build the Medtech leg of Addtech Life Science. In 2014, we created a separate company because we had industrial solutions, energy and process, and if you wanted to invest in a dedicated life science company, Addtech wasn't the first choice because it was a combination of things with different life cycles.

### Did you leave before or just after the spin-off?

No, we intended to create a separate company and were actively looking for one who could help us with Medtech, and found Mediplast in Sweden. Håkan Roos, the owner sold his company to us and we listed it on NASDAQ because we had a good critical mass. We also took in Medline, an American company, and seriously competed with OneMed and Mediq.

### What were those two companies you named?

Mediq is a Dutch competitor and OneMed is one of the biggest suppliers to hospitals in the Nordics.

### When was the Mediplast acquisition?

2015.

### Did that fire the starting shot to seek the spin-off?

Exactly. Then we had critical mass and it was okay to do it. We had planned to acquire Biomedica in Central Europe. Could I explain our initial business strategy?

### Yes.

[[Bergman & Beving]], the origin of [[AddLife]] and Addtech, was founded in 1906, by a German and a Swede who made acquisitions faster by having a decentralized organization. They started acquiring in the sixties and had 250 companies by 2000. They then split [[Bergman & Beving]] into three companies; Addtech, [[Lagercrantz]] and B&B Tools. We did the same at Addtech with the [[AddLife]] spin-off. That method allows for faster integration of companies compared to consolidation. Do you know Danaher?

### I'm familiar with Addtech and [[Bergman & Beving]], who have shown they can do that successfully for decades.

Many companies copied this model, such as [[Indutrade]] in Sweden and other companies abroad. It's a good way to get the best of being a small company with regards to personality, flexibility and speed, combined with financial muscle, networks and sustainability. Another success factor is they had a business school very early on. That's very important because you need glue to bind all the companies together. In addition to having the right leadership, you need to be a role model and walk the talk. [[Bergman & Beving]] focused on Nordic countries, whereas Addtech made acquisitions in Germany, BENELUX and the UK who have common values and business structures. That is also why we never entered the Iberian Peninsula, Italy or France.

In bigger European countries, the companies [[AddLife]] or Addtech represented, operated independently because it's a bigger market. Having nine countries in the Nordics plus Baltics makes it difficult for a company to establish the business on their own. That's why it's attractive to cover a bigger region and easier to offer suppliers the critical mass of nine countries and nine languages. Biomedica gave us access to Central Europe which has many countries. The acquisition of the Italian company EuroClone was opportunistic because we already represented them in the Nordics.

### When you were there you thought about buying EuroClone?

Yes, when [[Bergman & Beving]] made acquisition A, they always thought about the next one, which is very different to Thermo Fisher who grow by acquisitions. [[AddLife]] recently made some opportunistic acquisitions, such as the one in the UK, but that was a good move because it gave them access to a bigger market.

### Returning to your story, you left just before the spin-off?

No, I left after the spin-off. I had been commuting from Gothenburg to Stockholm for 10 years, and prior to that, I was living in France for seven, so I chose to be close to my family and took care of all the operations at [[AddLife]]. All the general managers or CEOs reported directly to me then we split the CEO work. Christina Kassberg was the CFO who focused on investors and I focused on operations. We made that agreement because she didn't know anything about life sciences. I left at the end of 2017 because I saw it was up and running and my intention was to be on the board of other companies.

### Did you believe the business was well set up in 2017?

We listed in April 2016 and, by the end of 2017, it was up and running.

### I'd love to hear about the early history of Addtech's life sciences business. You mentioned Mediplast was an important acquisition; what were the others?

> The most strategic acquisition was Triolab who represented Radiometer, who is in blood gas which is a very good business and similar to a Coca-Cola machine. You place the instruments, sell consumables and get organic growth without doing anything. There is a demographic aspect and the fact that you are making more tests in the periphery and in emergency departments, not only in central labs. That's a perfect piece, so Triolab became the extended arm of Radiometer who is a Danish company. It was easy for them to establish because of their relationship with Triolab, but Triolab was always treated as a Radiometer company. Triolab had Stago, a French company in coagulation that was also big business. The third leg was Koriba from Japan, who acquired a French immunology company. Those three businesses account for 65% of Triolab so it was a very stable business. The founder of Triolab, Göran Brandt, sold the company to Addtech.

### When did that occur?

The acquisition was in 2005 and Göran Brandt became the CEO of Addtech Life Science. We knew each other from the industry and I was headhunted when I was working in France to replace him because he wanted to retire. Without Triolab, it would have been extremely difficult for [[AddLife]] to become what they have, because it gave them access to new technologies such as molecular biology. We got a good deal with a South Korean company called Seegene, which allowed Triolab and [[AddLife]] to grow, not only during the pandemic due to Covid, but before due to next generation sequencing in molecular biology. These strategic steps were vital to get a footprint in several markets. Having Biomedica in Central Europe and Stago in the Nordics, made it easier to negotiate. Radiometer already owned establishments in Central European countries and were acquired by Danaher after they acquired HemoCue, a Swedish company.

When they acquired HemoCue, we negotiated to have HemoCue in the Nordics excluding Denmark because Radiometer is Danish. The diagnostic business gets 80% from the sale of reagents, 10% from instruments and 10% from services. That is a perfect business model because you don't start the year from scratch. The diagnostic business is also good because it grows organically. In the Labtech business, where we had microscopy or biosystems, it's digital sales which means when you sell a system you don't have recurring business, only service. That is more difficult because you start the year from the very beginning and the margins are lower compared to diagnostics.

### There's a lot of dependence on Radiometer; could Triolab lose that?

> That came up in the due diligence when we listed [[AddLife]], and Håkan Roos was very concerned because we could list the company then lose half the turnover. I had a good relationship with the CEO of Radiometer and the people from Danaher. We knew it would be difficult for them because it takes several years to get established and they couldn't take it from Denmark. We assessed a low risk for Radiometer to establish themselves. That remains the case today because if they have 45% margin and choose to do the business themselves, the cost of sales would be higher than that because they don't have the critical mass.

### Triolab is a big part of diagnostics; are there any others?

The BioNordika acquisition was very strategic because they had Lonza who is a supplier, Cell Signaling Technology which was very strategic and R&D Systems. Those strategic partners were important to get into the group. We never acquired a company because of their financial performance; it was based more on their portfolio. We asked which were the strategic companies we needed to broaden our portfolio and have a much better position, and if Cell Signaling Technology was one of them, BioNordika represent them in the Nordics so let's try to acquire them. There are other ways of getting representation because if you give Lonza or Cell Signaling Technology access to 15 countries, you could possibly sign an agreement. It is best to acquire a distributor who already has the footprint, people in the field and critical mass.

### It was driven by which supplier relationships you wanted as opposed to purely based on the financial performance of the acquisitions, more of a strategic lens?

Yes, exactly.

### When did you buy BioNordika?

2014.

### Any other big businesses you would draw attention to, prior to the spin-off?

We acquired Electra Books who represented One Lambda, who were acquired by Thermo Fisher. That was very strategic because they were in the HLA field for transplantation with a consolidated position in the market. When Thermo Fisher acquired them, we lost a lot, but we stayed in the field by taking other suppliers as we knew the business. Another was Immuno Diagnostic from Finland, who complimented Triolab and also had Cepheid, which was acquired by Danaher. Cepheid was strategic because they use a cassette system which is a convenient way to detect virus infections in point of care because it's plug and play. The trend in healthcare today is to enforce point of care, thereby decentralizing tests. That means you need to do more in the periphery and less in central labs, not only because of logistics but it's economically more sustainable to do it that way. Acquiring Immuno Diagnostics in 2012 was very strategic to get access to Cepheid in Sweden and partly in Norway and Denmark, but Cepheid decided to establish themselves in 2019 or 2020.

### In which countries?

Sweden and Denmark, then Hologic established themselves as Cepheid Nordik and Cepheid Sweden. They are a very attractive company because they are in multiplex, which means instead of testing Covid only, you can test Influenza A and B and Covid in one shot.

### How did Immuno Diagnostic deal with losing Cepheid in Sweden?

They compensated by using a South Korean supplier. They are no longer alone in having the technology as they were years ago; others are now doing the same.

### That gives a degree of anti-fragility that if you lose one supplier, you can take on another with similar technology?

When I was CEO, I ensured we had a plan B for all our strategic suppliers. If Cepheid or Stago get too big it makes sense for them to establish themselves, except as we discussed, Radiometer, due to the strong relation the company has with them.

### The best part of the business is diagnostics, but there have been few acquisitions there over recent years, is that because it's so difficult to find companies?

When I left the company, I put two key people in place, one responsible for Labtech and the other for Medtech. One got ill 18 months ago and Christina Kassberg didn't have the experience from the branch.

> To keep momentum, you need very good relations with suppliers, always looking for new opportunities in the market. I believe the company lost this momentum which is dangerous because you lose business focus when you become too administrative. To keep this going, you need to push the people working in the company because they are ambassadors and have their antennae in the market. You should have a way of communicating this information to the management of the company because salespeople meet customers and understand their needs.

### Is it difficult for people in the field to tell head office what customers need?

That has changed because I still have many colleagues working there. That is a prerequisite for this model to work, because you need to be active. This was why I choose to be operational and separate the role of the CEO being focused on investors, otherwise I would not have time to focus on the operation. Now Christina is the only CEO, so you lose many important things. You don't notice this immediately; it takes a while, and Christina was focusing on investors and not on the market. The guy who got ill was a business area director. When I joined Organon, it was a Dutch company owned by AkzoNobel, who had a large talent pool. When I was CEO, we had succession plans, but I don't believe this was in place because there was no good successor for him.

### Did Covid make it difficult for salespeople to communicate with customers and the head office or did it go deeper than that?

That is one factor. I was at the Medica in Dusseldorf this year, the biggest trade fair for medicine. I was also there the previous year and it was a big difference. You lose a lot but, even during the pandemic, people had access to customers through Teams so they were able to understand market needs and trends. It shouldn't have come as a surprise, but you need to continuously take care in this job.

### There seems to have been a change in acquisition strategy over recent years to have become larger companies outside the Nordics; what do you make of that?

The acquisition of Biomedica was good because it gave them access to many countries at the same time. The acquisitions of Spanish and Italian companies were more opportunistic. If you represent key suppliers like Medline in the Nordics, you can acquire whoever has Medline in France or Spain, but Martin, the previous CFO of [[AddLife]], became the business area director for Medtech, replacing the guy who had good experience in the field. To lead this specific business, it's important you have the background and experience otherwise it becomes challenging. It's also about gaining confidence from suppliers without a track record. The moment you look only from a financial perspective instead of being an industrial partner, you lose momentum.

### What does that mean in terms of the Italian and Spanish acquisitions?

The Italian acquisition was good because we already had EuroClone distribution in the Nordics.

### Which supplier was that?

EuroClone. If you are entering a business which is far away from your core, you have to be very cautious because you should be a niche player. Niches become commodities after a while, then you should find new niches. Getting into two products is harder because price is the only way to compete. That's why I am not happy to see they acquired those companies in Spain and the UK.

### Do you fear the Spanish company is too commoditized?

Yes, because it's harder to compete in areas with similar suppliers, and more difficult to get margin and be profitable. That move was more opportunistic.

### Did the company not have previous experience in the orthopedic segment?

No, which is a problem.

### Why did they do it?

An opportunity popped up by getting inputs from M&A companies. When you get to the size of [[AddLife]], they are always knocking on company's doors. The way we used to make acquisitions has totally changed. We always thought if you acquire A, what would you acquire next. We always tried to find synergies between acquisitions we made. They were eager to make acquisitions because they grew well in 2021 but significantly decreased in 2022 in terms of market value.

### What did you think about the UK acquisition?

> We already had some UK acquisitions in mind because we were thinking with Mediplast, they had interesting products or suppliers we wanted in the rest of the organization, especially in the Nordics. They also have many commodity products which are difficult to keep good margins in. Their figures show they still have 10% EBITDA but they have a direct competitor in One Med so are only competing on price. It's difficult to differentiate yourself when you have a straightforward specification.

### Isn't that generally the case in the medical business?

No, if you are in the wound care business and use silver as an antibacterial, it also creates a resistance mechanism, which is not good for a patient long term. If you have an alternative which doesn't contain silver but is also antimicrobial, that's where you differentiate yourself. There are ways to differentiate yourself in Medtech. Surgical instruments like tweezers have a specification but if you can demonstrate you don't need to change tweezers every two years because they last 10 years, that reflects on the price. There are ways of going around it, but it's harder with a commodity business so it's always much better to find niches.

### How much opportunity is there to make acquisitions in attractive niches as opposed to large commodity areas?

> Germany is the third biggest market after the US and Japan. China is taking over but there are many opportunities and interesting German distribution companies. France has some similar companies which cover Belgium and Francophone Switzerland. The Polish market is 40 million and growing and you can have a footprint in Czech Republic and Slovakia. Suppliers often choose Austria as the node for Eastern Europe, so there are also interesting Austrian companies. Spain and Italy are difficult because their healthcare is fragmented. France has 3,000 physician offices.

### Are there still opportunities to make niche acquisitions in the Nordics?

Absolutely, there are several, especially in the genetic field. Fields which are strategically important to make acquisitions in are point of care and home care.

### [[AddLife]] made several acquisitions in the home care space?

I initiated the Hepro acquisition in Norway because we saw we were going from reactive seek care to proactive healthcare. When we acquired Hepro we wanted to do add-on acquisitions. I know they have done some small ones in Sweden such as the company owned by Telia. If I were in their shoes, I would also explore the US.

### I would be nervous if the company invested in the US because I don't see where they have advantages versus local players.

That is a huge step, if they choose to make it.

I prefer small add-on acquisitions in the Nordics and Eastern Europe.

Focus on those areas and leave Italy, France and the Iberian Peninsula.

### The company expanded outside of the Nordics into Italy and Eastern Europe, is that a sign there's less opportunity left in the Nordics or a strategic move to open up a new growth path?

The acquisition of Biomedica was strategic as it gave access to six countries and we could take our Nordic representations into these new markets. That's what we had in mind with Stago, the French company.

### The company recently took on a new CEO; Christina stepped down and was replace by Fredrik Dalborg. Do you know him or have an opinion on that appointment?

I know him from the field but he doesn't have any diagnostic background. He comes from XVIVO who are in the transplantation area, where by washing organs, they have a longer shelf life. He is not from the diagnostic industry so I cannot judge his capabilities.

### If you are in many countries, is it unrealistic to be a specialist in every area?

No, it's not possible, but it's very important you have other qualities.

### I think the Labtech area has a strong leader in Peter Simonsbacka.

Peter Simonsbacka was the guy I placed as business area director. I brought him into [[AddLife]] to manage Labtech because he has a lot of knowledge.

### What else is important to discuss?

The company still has a very good EBITDA. It's important to buy companies with at least 7% or 8% EBITDA and to be able to improve that. 12% to 14% EBITDA is very good if you combine Labtech and Medtech. If it was only Labtech you could do 20. It needs to keep growing so it's important to make add-on acquisitions rather than buying a whole company. Companies can also do that instead of the group. Triolab could buy another supplier or distributor and working that way could be vital now. When company valuations decrease, you can find good acquisitions much cheaper.

### Could you comment on the quality of leadership at the subsidiary level?

It was always key to have the right leadership in companies because when you buy entrepreneurial companies, you need to ensure there is drive and motivation. It's the role of business area directors to push the CEOs of subsidiaries. If the company is too big, such as the Spanish or UK ones, you need to ensure you have the right leadership. There's a big difference in the way you manage each of the subsidiaries. Normally, we had monthly business reviews but you need more frequent follow-ups. It also becomes difficult when you have so many companies.

### What do you think of the leaders at Triolab and Mediq?

Fredrik Brandt is the son of Göran Brandt and is the general manager of Triolab Sweden. I've tried to steal him many times because he's very good. The Triolab subsidiaries also have very good people in them so there are no problems there. The same can be said for BioNordika. Mediplast has a very good CEO, Johan Bongstorp.

### He must be new because the guy who got ill was formerly the CEO?

Lars-Erik Rydell was a business area director before Johan.

### Is the leadership of the subsidiaries strong?

The companies I knew were, but I don't know the UK companies and the old management left Biomedica, so I cannot judge.

### We're out of time but it's been a pleasure speaking.
