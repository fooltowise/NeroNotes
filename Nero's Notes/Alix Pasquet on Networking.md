# Alix Pasquet on Networking


Hello everyone,

I’m very excited to share this follow-up conversation with my friend [Alix Pasquet III](https://twitter.com/alixpasquet), Managing Partner and portfolio manager at hedge fund Prime Macaya. Last time, Alix [shared his thoughts on the learning mindset for investors](https://neckar.substack.com/p/the-learning-mindset-for-investors) (on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/72weRffGW1WajljPBEHwcC) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMmjbHAHdNU), [presentation and transcript](https://neckar.substack.com/p/follow-up-alix-pasquet-and-the-learning)).

> If your behavior hasn't changed, you haven't learned. Learning is not sitting on a desk, and cramming your brain with knowledge that you're going to recite one day.

It was a popular talk and this time I wanted to dig deeper into an area in which I’ve learned a lot from Alix over the years: how to build enduring networks.

I’ve long struggled with this. I can get tense and self conscious around large groups of strangers. It takes me a while to open up. I shudder at the memory of handing out business cards and playing a character rather than being my natural self. Conferences and happy hours were not my happy place.

Alix taught me a lot about how to build networks in an intuitive and organic way by always trying to connect people and ideas. For examples of the importance of networking you can revisit the [Reading Obsession](https://neckar.substack.com/p/the-reading-obsession) or my piece on [Michael Milken](https://neckar.substack.com/p/the-milken-way).

This is another example of compounding and gets easier the bigger your network gets. The real challenge is your network is not that big and when you feel like you’re missing key nodes. Alix shared some valuable ideas on how to cold start (and cold approach).

We then dug into a range of other topics including personality types in investing, the idea of power pairs, adapting to regime change and, of course, learning — and the importance of un-learning.

> You have to be good at unlearning. You need some sort of amnesia. And also an amnesia about your mistakes. There's a sort of revisionist history that happens with great investors sometimes. There are examples of them incinerating capital. They kind of forget about it. You need a little bit of that. You have to have this philosophy of mistakes. We’re human, we're fallible and we don't understand things perfectly. This is what we do, it's okay. On the contrary, we need these mistakes to learn from and to move on.

I hope you’ll enjoy the conversation.

## The power of triads

> A triad is very simple. You take two people in your network that don't know each other, but that have something in common or they're trying to accomplish something, either a goal, or a task, or they might really get along. And what you do is you introduce them together. You write an email, and you say _John, meet Michael, I thought you guys would want to meet because of XY and Z. Look forward to hearing how it goes._ So having them connect and then more importantly, letting them be.
> 
> Sociologists that have done studies of networks find that the most successful people have six stable triads in their networks. And again, if you're looking for the work to back this up, there's a bunch but I refer you first to David Logan's book _**[Tribal Leadership](https://www.triballeadership.net/)**_, chapter 10 on triads.
> 
> Here's what stops people from creating triads. We all have post-traumatic stress from one thing. When we were younger, we introduced one friend to another, and they took off and left us behind and had all this fun without us. So now we started hogging our networks saying no, I don't want to introduce this person. That's a scarcity mindset, you need to have an abundance mindset. We also have a fear of getting ripped off, of someone taking advantage of us and you kind of have to get over that. You have to get used to the fact that people are going to be successful without you.
> 
> **By the way, the most powerful business partnership in the world is probably Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett, and we tend to focus on these two guys, but we never asked, wait a second, who introduced Charlie to Warren?**

## Cold Approach : Persistence

> How do you approach an important person? Okay, one thing you have to understand is that if an important person is really good, they're going to be busy, so the most important tactic is going to be persistence. You're going to have to email him and call him many times to be able to get in front of him. And also, very important people usually got to where they got because of persistence. So the only thing they truly respect in somebody else is somebody else that's also done that. **One of the patterns of success is constant persistence in the face of constant rejection until you breach through that barrier to entry.** So Persistence is key. 

## Cold Approach : Preparation

> You get in front of them. You need to come prepared. You've researched this person's life and you have questions. Literally bring a notepad and questions. But you also want to focus on a certain type of question. You need to figure out how to get him to speak about his fears and frustrations, the problems he's trying to solve, and his wants and aspirations. What's he working on that he's trying to accomplish three to five years from now? And you keep asking questions across the categories of what he's trying to accomplish.
> 
> Once you have that, you're probably not going to have a solution because you don't have the experience or the contacts. Use that as a project, go and try to solve for those fears and frustrations and wants and aspirations. 
> 
> While still keeping things confidential, call your other mentors and say hey, hypothetical, somebody's trying to accomplish this. And you have to keep things discreet, use hypotheticals. Write those things down, put it in a document, send it back to the guy, that's another way of raising your importance.

## Personalities, Polarities, Partners

> In the investment business, you need confidants, people to bounce ideas off of. Especially me, by the way, as an extrovert. One of the problems with extroverts in the investment business is we need to speak about an idea to shake it out. The problem with that is when we're speaking, the gibberish comes out. The number of times where I say, well it's this and I'm like wait, now that I've heard it, no, it's not that. It drives the introverts crazy, so you kind of need that.
> 
> The other reason why this concept is powerful is we find that most funds that have done well, these power pairs happened by accident. Very few of them went and consciously said hey, you know what, I'm an ENTJ, let me hire a bunch of INTPs around. Or I'm an INTJ, we need extroverts. In fact, I would say that most of the tests in the hedge fund business are designed to crowd out the extroverts and to hire these highly introverted dorks, that are people after my own heart. **The problem is, you're left with a monoculture. You don't have cognitive diversity inside the business.**
> 
> **One of the reasons why \[Buffett and Munger\] do so well, I believe, of course I could be wrong, but it's because of that polarity, that power pair potential. I can name hedge funds after hedge funds or investment firms after investment firms where this power pair concept exists.** 

## Teaching : Altruistic and self-serving

> I don't like things that are altruistic, I don't like things that are self-serving, I like things that are _both_ altruistic and self-serving. And teaching is both. I love seeing young people do well with what I've taught them. But I also love five years later, when they call me with their best ideas, so that's amazing. And again, you planted the seed and then it's five years later that it becomes an oak.

## Make some time for gratitude phone calls

> One very important networking practice that not only makes you a great human being, but it's a very important practice, is gratitude phone calls.
> 
> You make a list of people that you haven't spoken to for a while, you call them up and say _hey, I love you. I miss you. You added a lot of value to my life._ _I know we haven't spoken, but I'm here for you if you need me._ It's very important; a gratitude expression. It makes you a good human being and it's also very self-serving. So again, I like things that are both altruistic and self-serving at the same time.

## Never stop learning

> Alix Pasquet: **The saddest thing to happen to me right now, is some of my peers that I grew up in the business with have stopped learning.**
> 
> Frederik Gieschen**:** In what way and why?
> 
> Alix Pasquet**:** They’re not adapting. They no longer want to work on shorts, they no longer want to work in sectors that they don't understand. “Oh, this is outside, this is not what I do.”
> 
> Frederik Gieschen**:** Outside their circle of competence, you mean.
> 
> Alix Pasquet**:** Right. **When we were kids, we didn't know anything, we'd go and lock ourselves in a room and figure it out. Now it’s like “oh, I can't do that.”** Very sad for me. When you look at these guys, one of the reasons is their physical health is not what it should be. They no longer have the energy of a younger person. They're tense, they don't eat well, they don't work out, they don't manage stress.
> 
> One of the main drivers of my life currently is the few hours a day that I spend on exercise and recovery. And you kind of need to, by the way, in our business, because of all the stress. You can have the capacity to handle stress, and there are definitely a lot naturally, but there's definitely a lot of things that you can do to augment that. Massage, acupuncture, and all of the weird shit that you've heard me say over the years that I do. So getting rid of that tension in your body. You can never truly get rid of it by the way, you can lower it in many ways. A certain amount of tension is positive, especially to propel you forward. But there are definitely certain things you can do to dissipate it, and if you don't, you will break, you will burn out. 

## Study battle-tested methods

> You want to learn from fields that have battle-tested methods. Intelligence, the things that they've tried when it did not work, people died so those things that they keep doing usually tend to work. Same thing in the military, same thing in sports, same thing in construction, for example, or architecture. There are principles or methods or tools that’ve been battle-tested.
> 
> Frederik Gieschen: It's like the margin of safety in investing and engineering for a bridge. Certain concepts just hold, they're important.
> 
> Alix Pasquet**:** Right, I love that. And that Buffett example. Have you seen these Roman bridges that were built 2000 years ago, you know why they’re like that? Because the architect has to sleep there with his family. 

## Adapting to regime change

> It's not only you that one has to adapt, but it's also your business, your environment. So **when you find these highly frugal investors, like Buffett, that frugality actually allows them to adapt better.** If you've got a lot of ownership, you're not frugal, you have too many people. When change comes, it's much harder for you to change and adapt than it is if you’re asset light. So one of the personal characteristics that you need is frugality. These guys are so frugal that people make fun of them.
> 
> There's that amazing example of the big guy (Buffett) is with Katharine Graham, and Katherine needs a dime to make a phone call, And Buffett's got a quarter and he's going to make change. Graham is like, “Give me the quarter Warren!” That's how frugal this guy is. It's very important.
> 
> I was recently at the house of a very powerful investor and one of my friends was like, I can't believe this is how he lives. Because of how much money this guy has, versus how he lives. He's older and grew up in the Depression, and has totally different values than we do today. 

## The difficulty of changing culture

> A business culture can have an impact on the business, the stock price, and even competition. Especially today because we have a lot of tech businesses that still have growth cultures that have to become profitability cultures. And guess what, it's really difficult for a CEO to do. Think about the things to change as a CEO: you have to change the incentive structure of your sales team, you have to fire unprofitable customers, your board of directors, the KPIs that they track, so that you can have a strategic conversation with them, your supplier relationships change. So if you went from a growth culture and growth environment, and now we have to focus on profitability culture, it's really difficult.


## Study Writing and Creative Work

> **I believe that there's a very strong correlation between good writing and good investing. And the writing process very much resembles the investment process.**
> 
> One recent writing concept for me is subtext. I was watching an interview by Tarantino, and he was talking about doing the subtext of a scene. He says, okay, you've taken a piece of writing, and you're about to film the scene. But the way that you truly get to the value of the emotion of the scene, is by asking, hey, this character, what does he want out of this interaction? And the character he's speaking with, what does he want out of this interaction? And then you as a director, what do you want out of this interaction? And then looking from the point of view of the audience and saying what is the audience going to get out of this interaction?
> 
> By doing that, you're more able to get to the insights of what this film or the scene is really going to be about. So not only do the contextual work, but also the sub-textual work. Well, in the investment business, that's a very powerful thing to do. How does the customer see this company? How does the supplier see this company? How does the competitor see this company? How does the investment business see this company? And in those mixes of perspectives, that's how insights drop.
