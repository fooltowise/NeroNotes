### Artur, can you explain a little bit about [[Addtech]]’s history?

I used to work for [[Addtech]] and it is a very interesting company that originally came from a group called [[Bergman & Beving]], in 1906. Over the years, the two gentlemen, Bergman and Beving, developed a good way of acquiring companies but, instead of centralizing, they kept the companies decentralized. By doing that, they saw that it was much easier to integrate companies as well as keeping the entrepreneurial spirit, so it was a very good business model.

In 1976, the company went on the Stock Exchange in Stockholm and it grew very rapidly. By the year 2000, the group was too big and they decided to split it up and they formed three different companies. One was [[Addtech]], the other one was [[Lagercrantz]] and the third one was B&B Tools.

Addtech’s journey started at that time and, by the year 2016, the decision was made to split it again and take out the life science part of Addtech and that became a new company called [[AddLife]], that was also listed in April 2016.

### Are there really any synergies between those different business units within Addtech, like components, energy and life sciences?

The key business idea of having a decentralized business model is to have a business toolbox, with tools that the different companies in the group can use. For example, you could have access to ERP or CRM systems or CSRs for sustainability. You could have ISO certification regulations. There are a lot of things that could be shared and you don’t need to invent them twice. That is a very good synergy and a very good way of sharing those kind of resources which means that the companies can focus more on the commercial operations.

Other ways of getting synergies are, of course, to have a geographic setup, in the same way. That also means that you could, potentially, utilize the different companies or offices that you have, in different countries, without the need to set up your own offices.

You can also get synergies from technical services. You can get synergies from using the same kind of banks or consultants. Additionally, you can get synergies with training, such as sales or leadership training. There are a number of synergies that you can get from a setup, even though the different business areas may not really have a direct synergy with each other because you are working with different customer segments.

### But, for example, labtech and medtech seem to have different customers and even suppliers, a lot of the time?

Maybe that’s a little bit different because labtech and medtech are within the life sciences, where you can share, for example, technical services. Instead of having four different service organizations, you could have one. You could also utilize the portfolio that you have in the different companies, in order to differentiate yourself in the tender process, because you could then maybe offer some products as a bundle, for example. There are some synergies that you can utilize, especially with public tenders.

### Who are the two families that have most of the voting and control in Addtech? Is it the original founders and their families?

It’s a public company. For these groups, when it’s time to do some acquisitions, of course, you can create new shares and this is actually something that has been done in the past.

### I think it’s Tom Hedelius and Anders Börjesson that own 30% of the total voting control, as a pair; 15% each. Is that part of the original founding family?

Actually, no, but they have been there from a very early stage. I think, probably, since the company was listed in 1976, so they have been in the company for many years. There is a very long legacy because their families are also part of the board in some of the companies. But they are not related to Bergman and Beving.

### So they set the culture and influence how the businesses are run?

Yes; they have a very broad industrial experience. Tom Hedelius was the general manager of one of the biggest banks in Sweden, Handelsbanken. They have a long trajectory of expertise, when it comes to business and industrial development.

### How do you compare the life sciences division at Addtech, which is now [[Addlife]], to competitors in the Nordics?

First of all, if you take the Nordics, you take Scandinavia and you add Finland, and suddenly it becomes the Nordics. In Norway, Sweden and Denmark, we speak Scandinavian and Finnish is a very different language; that’s why we called it Nordics, when we include Finnish. There is also a tendency to also include the Baltic countries because, historically, they seem to belong more to the Nordic culture, when it comes to values. Very often, they care more about the references that you have in the Nordics. For example, when you are speaking with key opinion leaders or when you are talking about having references in the hospitals, they care more about the Nordics than, for example, look at what they have in Poland or Russia and so on. It’s very natural that when we say the Nordics, we also include the Baltics, so three more countries. Of course, Iceland as well, but it was always quite given that it is also included in the Nordics.

You therefore have 26 to 28 million people. You have different languages so for companies coming from outside, if they are going to be able to establish themselves in a region like that, I think it’s very complex. You need to have a critical mass; you need to have the countries if you are going to be successful, because you also need to translate, for example, the manuals and so on. In some cases, you need to answer in the local languages. It is quite complicated to establish that business if you do not already have a Nordic setup or a Nordic organization.

That is why it is quite competitive to have a Nordic setup and, very often, the companies that are most successful in the Nordics actually have operations in all the Nordic countries. You can gain a lot of synergies in the marketplace because you can have local sales people, speaking the local languages, but you could have sales managers and marketing people, centralized in the Nordics, where they are often placed, for example, in Sweden. Not only because Sweden is the biggest country in the Nordics but also because of the geography in that it is more in the middle of Scandinavia and the middle of the Nordics.

For that reason, US or Asian companies who want to get established in the Nordics, very often they see Sweden as a natural candidate for where to have their head office.

### In terms of the competitors, are they mainly much smaller, with only single-focused product lines, that compete with Addtech and [[AddLife]] in the Nordics? It seems as if there are no other big scale distributors.

No, there’s not. If you already have something set up in the Nordics, it is much easier to have add ons. If you have a very small company and you have to deal with a very big geographical area, as the Nordics is, then it’s quite difficult, from a profitability point of view, to maintain that.

### Let’s say I’m DiaSorin, for arguments sake, an Italian supplier, and I’m entering the Nordics, is there any other similar labtech distributor that I can choose instead of [[AddLife]]?

Absolutely; there are several options. I would say that the strength of [[AddLife]], or similar companies that have a broad Nordic set up, is that firstly, companies within Europe can compete with each other, so that means that you are able to take similar products and cover a much bigger segment. The companies are independent but they belong to the same group. I think that is very smart.

The other thing is that there are other companies but, very often, local companies. That means that they do not have a Nordic set up. If you are a supplier and you have to choose between someone that offers you, for example, nine countries or 25 countries, instead of going to 25 different distributors, you would choose that option.

### So it’s really just the scale advantage and the local presence in each country that really gives an advantage?

Yes, very much so. In some specific cases, you would like to have dedicated resources to take care of your products. Maybe in those cases, there is a choice from some suppliers to say, hey guys, we would like somebody that is dedicated 100% to our products and, therefore, we prefer to work with smaller companies.

### If we see the trend continue, of suppliers consolidating, does that decrease the bargaining power of the distributor?

Absolutely, and it’s not only the consolidation at the supplier level, but it’s also the consolidation that is happening within the healthcare area. You have bigger and bigger purchasing groups. For example, in Norway, the regions have gone from nine to four. The same thing has happened in Sweden. It is continuously decreasing which also means that it makes it more difficult for small companies to handle this big tender business. Even for bigger companies, there is more risk where you could potentially lose half of your turnover at once, if you lose one tender.

### Do you think there is pricing pressure or lack of pricing power for the distributor, with these larger tenders and more consolidation?

I would say so. I think it is an organization problem more than a price issue. It’s a little bit controversial, but healthcare should be growing more into the periphery. For example, if you are talking about diagnostics, you could do many of the tests directly, at point of care, in health centers, rather than centralizing it. From both a logistics and efficiency point of view, it would be better doing it in the periphery; it would be cheaper to do it that way.

For example, the patients don’t need to travel and go to central hospitals. You will gain in terms of logistics because you won’t need to send the samples to the central hospitals. It should make sense to have a decentralized healthcare, at the point of care. But for organizational reasons, they are centralizing the hospitals and the hospitals are getting bigger. This may be a trend in the Nordics that you don’t see in other countries. In other regions or countries, it is becoming more and more decentralized.

I think you can choose which things could be centralized and which things could be decentralized and look at it from a very broad perspective.

### Could this be an advantage for bigger players, such as [[AddLife]] or Addtech, that can actually compete on a larger scale?

Absolutely. The winners are always going to be the bigger companies. If you had a bigger company and you are offering many other things in the hospitals, you could also bundle things and play with prices. Where you have the competition, you could, potentially, decrease the prices and increase them in other areas where you don’t have the competition.

### Let’s say I’m DiaSorin, just as a hypothetical example, and I approach you as a labtech distributor. How does that typically work? So you will sell my equipment and my reagents?

Absolutely. Specifically, if you are talking about DiaSorin, which is a diagnostic player, it is very important to not only sell the instruments but you need to sell the reagents, the consumables. You also need to have a differentiated service to be able to sell the technical or maintenance service.

The distribution of these three things, in the best case, is to have 80% coming from consumables or reagents, 10% should come from instruments and 10% should come from technical services, training or other types of services that you deliver. That is very important because, if you have that Xerox or Coca-Cola machine model, then you will have a sustainable business which is much better than just selling instruments. If you just sell instruments, it is what we call digital sales and, at the beginning of each year, you need to start from scratch. Once you have sold a system or an instrument to a customer, then the recurring business is very low. It’s always the best business to have consumables. Strategically, that plays an important role in the decision for a supplier, to see whether you can have a consumable business.

### You are only selling the supplier’s reagents to the customer? You sell the customer’s instrument and you sell their reagents every year?

Yes; it’s a recurrent system. It’s like placing a Coca-Cola machine somewhere and you just fill it with Coca-Cola cans.

### So this is the driver of the 80% to 85% of turnover being recurring revenue for the Labtech division?

Yes, that is correct. There are a number of companies in the field, even big ones, who only sell instruments. They have a problem and if you look at the profitability of those companies, in general, it’s lower than the diagnostic companies.

### Could you step in and sell your own reagents or the consumables, as a distributor?

That depends. You have both open systems and closed systems. It’s a bit like the printers with the inks, where some of the printers are able to be loaded with generic inks, so you can buy them from ink.com and it works very well. But then you have some printers that do not accept any generic consumables, so you need to stick to the original producer. That is a choice that you make, as a supplier. In some specific cases, the hospitals may also take an active decision to say, we would like to have an open system because we would like to run our own reagents that we produce in the lab, or we would like to run other types of generic reagents that we can buy elsewhere in the market.

### Could that be a risk if we see higher consolidation and bigger purchasing groups? Do you think they could take back some of that reagent recurring revenue business from the distributors?

They could but I think it would be quite difficult. What many suppliers are doing today is that when you use the instruments you will need to scan the barcode of the reagents or consumables that you are using. If they don’t talk to each other, then it will not be possible to use them. I think the companies are obviously securing their business by doing it that way, if the hospitals do not impose upon them the fact that they want to have an open system. If you end up in that situation, it’s a matter of how the contract with the hospital is written. For example, if they are committed to a certain minimum purchasing quantity, then it’s very difficult for the hospitals to just stop using the consumables.

### Do they have to commit to a certain volume of consumables, per year, with most instruments?

There are probably three different types of business models when you are selling to hospitals. The first one is capital sales, so you are just selling the instruments and they then buy the reagents at the rate at which they are using them. The second model is that you place the instrument free of charge and then you put the price from the instrument onto the number of reagents that you are selling. In that case, you will need to make a contract with the hospitals, to have a minimum commitment for the reagents so that you can also finance the instrument.

The third way of doing it is doing it via a bank. You lease the equipment but the bank pays the company so the hospital only deals with the bank and they pay a monthly fee for the lease of the instruments.

### But can they get the reagents on their own?

If they are just buying the instrument, for example, and they have an open system, then it’s up to them what they use. If they choose to have the business model where they get the instrumentation from the supplier, free of charge, in that case, they are committed to using the reagents from the suppliers. That is actually the most common model in the market today.

### Can the customer, the hospitals, bypass the distributor and go straight to DiaSorin, for example, and buy the reagents from them, rather than through the distributor?

If you have a closed system, from BioMérieux for example, you cannot go to DiaSorin and buy the reagents because they will not work. But if you are a DiaSorin distributor and the hospital says that they are going to go directly to DiaSorin to buy the reagents directly, then it’s more about the contract that you have made, as a distributor, with the mother company, DiaSorin. It shouldn’t be allowed.

There is something else that we see in the market which is a parallel import which means that there are some suppliers that, even though you are a distributor in a certain geographic area, for certain products, sometimes they could be got from another country, via a third party, into your market and then you are competing with your own products. They may come in from another country where they can buy the products cheaper or they are subsidized.

That could happen, potentially, and it’s sometimes very difficult to avoid. There are some ways to avoid it, of course, and I think it’s very important to have a good dialogue with your customers so that you do not end up in those situations.

### Are they typically exclusive deals with the suppliers. For example, for BioMérieux or DiaSorin, are you the only Nordic distributor when you sign those agreements?

I would say, in general, yes. But in some cases, for example when it comes to Thermo, Sigma and these kind of companies, they have several channels in the market. Nobody has exclusivity and it’s quite hard to get exclusivity. Suppliers, especially from China, can also choose to work with several channels. If you are going to be an exclusive distributor then you also need to have a commitment on the minimum purchase in terms of volume or dollars. But if you are not able to commit to how much you are going to be able to sell in a certain market, then the supplier will be free to have different channels.

### What do you think is the biggest risk to the recurring revenue for labtech distributors?

The biggest risk is that the mother companies, the suppliers of the bigger distributors, decide to start their own business in the same geographic areas. That is, of course, a latent risk. As long as you are small and you don’t have that much turnover, it doesn’t make sense for the mother company to open their own business. But if you become quite big and you have a critical mass, then the supplier may start wondering what it would take for them to establish themselves in that geographic area, in order for them to have better profitability.

That is an exercise that you will need to do but, in the end, if you have 40% to 45% gross margin, which is quite common in the market, and you know that the cost of sales for those products is probably 30% to 35%, then you are gaining 10%. Is that worth doing it? That is a decision that needs to be made case by case, but that is the biggest risk.

### Do you think it’s likely that those suppliers would set up their own distribution locally?

Absolutely. If they company reaches a good critical mass, it makes sense because there are some advantages to go directly, in certain markets. For example, maybe you will have a better competitive advantage when it comes to negotiations as you are dealing directly with the mother company.

### Why haven’t they done it already? Surely these big companies, such as Thermo, must have huge sales in Sweden?

Most of the big companies such as Siemens, Abbott, Roche, BioMérieux and so on, are acting on their own and they don’t have any distributors. I would say, for Thermo, they have both; they have distributors but they also have their own organization. Depending on the volume, they let the distributors take care of it. That is very much what is already happening. I think there are very few companies, who have a good critical mass, who are not established by themselves in the market. Sometimes, for the reasons that I mentioned before, you might have very big suppliers who are still using distributors because of the competitive advantages where you have a Nordic setup. Maybe you are approaching 25 countries, so it’s easier to use one partner, one big distributor, in those cases. I think it varies case by case. DiaSorin was using distributors for many years in the Nordics.

### Maybe it will be a slow trend where suppliers might enter one country at a time but still use the likes of [[AddLife]] or Addtech because they have a 25-country footprint?

Exactly; if you already have an infrastructure, why not? It will take a lot of time and effort to do it by yourself. It’s not that easy because you will need to set up a full operation, everything from order handling to people in the field taking care of the technical service.

### What’s so hard about setting up your own local service? Taking the technical service, for example, surely they know their own products. Don’t they just need to find someone who can speak the language and knows the culture and the customer. Is that the hard part?

First of all, obviously, you need to have local people. You need to have people speaking the local language, particularly as you have a tender business. When it comes to sales, because you are selling them in healthcare, it depends on which area of life sciences you are in. If you are going to academia or research and development, it works with English, especially in the Nordics and you could manage it from a sales point of view. Over the years, I have had many colleagues just speaking English, as sales people in the Nordics and it hasn’t been a problem. But you still need to have some people speaking the local language.

For the technical service, you do not necessarily need someone who speaks the local language. But it’s very important to speak the local language for field service applications. It could be that you have to deal directly with the users and if you are dealing directly with the users, in a hospital, it works in English but it’s preferable to be able to speak the local language.

### Up to a third of Addtech and [[Addlife]]’s revenue is own products. How does that business work with the distribution business? For example, do you have to produce products that are not competing with your suppliers’ portfolio?

First of all, I would say that the distribution business is quite good because you are selling what the market is asking for. Secondly, you are more agile because you can switch very quickly. If the market starts looking for something else, you can take another supplier and you can meet that need in the market. If you have your own product, then you are stuck with your own portfolio and you have to live with that; you don’t have the same flexibility. That is a big disadvantage.

An advantage of having your own production is that you have full control over the whole chain. From a profitability point of view, I think it’s better if you have your own production. It’s a balance, I would say. I think it’s a very good business model, in some cases, especially when you have companies the size of [[AddLife]], to have a mix of own production and distribution. That creates a good balance from a risk point of view, but also from a profitability point of view.

### How do you choose which product lines to launch or to acquire?

That goes back to the previous question. If you could foresee that you are going to have some risk if you have quite a big business and you have the critical mass and you have the risk of losing the business because the distributor wants to start their own company, then maybe you should take the strategic decision to say, I will make the decision to stop and then I don’t have that risk and I will switch all the customers into my platform. That could be one reason.

The other reason could be from a profitability point of view where you see that the margins are so small, either you leave that market segment or you put some effort into that segment, to get more profitability and a better gross margin. It very much depends from case to case how and when you take that decision.

In some cases, it is also a bit opportunistic. If you have more low-take products, me too products, that are quite cheap and easy to produce, maybe it makes sense to do it locally, as opposed to importing from another country.

### Can you compete with your suppliers on the distribution side, with your own product?

That depends on the contract that you have. Obviously, if you are competing directly and you have an exclusive distribution for certain products, you will lose that. It is also not ethically correct.

But if you are producing some products that make sense and you have a good synergy or they are complementary with the products that you are already selling, then it’s okay and everyone will be happy.

### Such businesses are going to be mainly niche, local businesses, in the Nordics, that you acquire, that have their own production and are complementary to your supplier’s distribution business?

Yes; and I think it’s okay to do it like that.

### Some distributors in the Nordics, even in the UK, don’t have their own manufacturing or products. Do you think it’s always best for value-added distributors to have some of their own products, as well as having the supplier’s distribution business?

No, I don’t think so. As I mentioned earlier, I think it’s very important to keep your flexibility. Depending on which area you are working in, if the market is evolving very quickly, I think having the flexibility of choosing according to the market needs is very important. If you are in a market where the market is growing very fast and the technology is changing very rapidly, if you have your own production, there is a risk that you get stuck with what you have. There are pros and cons.

If you are also working with your own production in a very agile way, that could be a good option. In some cases, it might also be that you have some local specificities and that is why it makes sense to have your own production because you cannot use the generic products that you buy for some specific purposes.

### What do you think is the biggest risk to the gross margin for the Nordic value-added distributors?

Many suppliers religiously increase the prices every year, no matter what. They will send you a letter and say, we are now increasing our distributor prices by 3%. But the problem is, if you are in the tender business and you have a contract with the hospital for five years, you know that during those five years, you are not going to be able to increase the price by a penny. That means that if you are losing 3% to 5% every year due to price increases and you are going to end up in a tricky situation. It is very important to foresee this when you are in a tender business, and to be able to calculate that in advance. If you know that you are going to get an increase of 2% to 3% per year, you need to take that into consideration when you send out the tender.

### [[AddLife]]’s gross margin has increased from 30% to over 35%, which seems to be much higher than Addtech; why is that?

That is because it’s a different specificity. The healthcare industry has still got better pricing than the industrial business, for example, where you have more competition.In the healthcare industry, you also find ways to increase your profitability. For example, you have organic growth that can be very favorable if you have a tender business. If the customers have committed to 100,000 samples per year and you have placed equipment with them, very seldom do they take into consideration that the population is increasing and you are going to have an organic increase of maybe 4% to 5% per year. If you take that incremental for five years, then your gross margin is going to increase because every new sample that you sell is going directly into your pocket. The leasing that you have calculated for the instruments is based on just the original 100,000 tests that you sell. If you sell 120,000, that means that for those additional 20,000 tests, you get the full gross margin directly into your pocket.

### There is more room to increase your gross margin in the healthcare distribution, rather than in industrial?

Absolutely.

### Because the end market is just growing organically?

Also because you can turn it a little bit when it comes to diagnostics. You can say, what is the value that you are getting from this specific test, for the patient, rather than taking the cost of goods and adding a gross margin into the product.

### If I’m the supplier, I must also be looking at that and thinking, I could capture some of this margin, if I was in the Nordics. As the market size grows and the size of my critical mass in the area grows, I should be more encouraged to, potentially, move in with my own business?

That is correct. There are some suppliers that say, it’s going to be a win/win. That means that if you increase your prices in the market, then we also want a slice of the cake. There are some contracts that are like that. But I think, when you increase your gross margin, it also gives room for the suppliers that start to think about whether they are going to open their own subsidiary, because maybe then, it makes sense.

An increasing gross margin doesn’t only come from the sales of reagents. In some cases, it is also because you are selling other types of services. When I say other types of services, it could be training, it could be that you are making protocols for the customers.

### Is that more likely in medical and healthcare, as opposed to industrial, to provide the other types of services?

It shouldn’t be, because I think you have good opportunities in industrial, if you think the same way. Selling products in industrial is probably seen as more traditional, as opposed to healthcare. Companies in the healthcare industry are very creative when it comes to how to build models to be able to get good profitability.

### What is more difficult about the industrial business? Putting aside the fact that the end market could be slightly more cyclical, potentially, is there any way that the customer deals differently with distributors or expects different service levels versus a hospital, for example?

In the industrial field, you may not have the same business model, when it comes to the reagent business. You are selling articles or a machine, but it is very seldom that you sell a machine that uses consumables. Also, you have much higher competition in the industrial field and it is probably more aggressive in the way that they sell and you have very big groups.

In the healthcare care industry, you have to demonstrate the value added when you are positioning your products. In the pharmaceutical industry, the clinical value, in the end, is what counts.

### What is the value-added part for the distributor, when they are selling the instrument and the reagents?

The value added is not only the services that you offer, in terms of relationship and so on, how fast you deliver your products and everything that can be measured, but in the end, it’s a question of your own ability. Having training and seminars that you organize; in-bound marketing is a very good thing today, where you offer knowledge. In the old days, the person in the healthcare industry could go to different exhibitions but over the last 10 years, it has been very difficult to do that because companies are not sending people to these exhibitions anymore, where they could have training or learn about what is new in the market.

Of course, that is due to the fact that they don’t have the same financial possibilities any more and that is why there are then opportunities for the companies to offer those kind of services directly to the hospitals, where they can increase the knowledge of the users in the hospitals.

### What do you think is the biggest risk of the distributors not adding enough value?

It is like every business; if you don’t offer the right service, if you are not a customer-centric organization, if you are not proactive in the way you approach the customers, these all have an impact. Bad services are the best ambassador for losing business. I think it’s very much a matter of the relationship with your customers and also, how good you are in helping and supporting them.

### Can we briefly discuss the economic model? Why do you use return on working capital as a key metric?

Profit on working capital is a very good parameter to measure how profitable a business is. The good thing about it is that you can go down into the product range and analyze the P divided by WC or you can look, for example, into a business unit or business area in the company, or even the whole company, and analyze it. P is only three parameters; it is sales time gross margin, minus the costs. The working capital is your inventories plus your account receivables minus your account payables.

You can influence five of those parameters to a certain level. You can adjust your inventories so it is good enough, but you cannot have too little in your inventory because your customers will then suffer. You also cannot have too much, because it then binds capital. You can adjust your account receivables to a certain level, but it is unrealistic to ask your customers to pay in advance for the products that you are going to deliver.

Let’s say that you can adjust it to 30 days, which is very common in our market. The account payables does the same. You cannot ask your suppliers to wait for a year until you pay them, especially in the Nordics, and you may also have 30 days. In terms of costs, everybody in the company can contribute to that but also, only to a certain level because nobody wants to work in an anorectic company. If you adjust the costs too much, then it is no longer any fun working in that company.

You can adjust the gross margin by increasing your prices or maybe by making the production more efficient. But it is unrealistic to think that you are going to be able to increase your gross margin forever because it also has to be reflected in how much the market can pay.

The only parameter that you can increase to infinity is the sales. Out of the six parameters, everyone in the company understands that it is the sales that is going to really make the difference, because you have a commercial organization; I think that is very central. Also, if P divided by WC is bigger than 45% then the business will be self-financing and you will have a profitable business.

It’s quite easy to make that calculation and that is why it is very much used. I recall that it is even called the super parameter because it is so good and also so simple for everyone in the organization to understand. Everybody can contribute, from whatever department they are in, to any of these parameters where you have in P divided by WC.

### How did you focus on increasing sales, year on year, to infinity?

To increase the sales is an eternal process. Firstly, I remember my old manager saying to me, it’s not only quantity that counts, but also quality. But most important is the direction. Quantity, quality and direction. If you are going to increase sales, just because you make 10 more visits, that doesn’t mean anything. But if you can have 10 visits a week and they are qualitative and you can measure it, that is much better than doing 20 that don’t bring in anything.

When I say direction, I mean that you are visiting the right customers and the decision makers. You need to be able to identify them. In other words, having a good sales process, from the beginning to the end, and also very good follow up after you have made the sales, that is the key for success. Companies that succeed the most are best at selling the products.

Sometimes companies or colleagues ask, do you really need to have the best products if you are going to be the most successful in the market? Obviously, the answer has always been yes, but that is not true. It is very much up to you. You don’t necessarily need to have the best products to be the most successful in the market. It is a question of how you position the products and how passionate you are when you are selling. It is also a question of the commitment that you have, the interest you are showing in the customers and the relationships that you build with the customers. It is a combination of many factors, but not necessarily having the best products in the market.

### You can layer on the inorganic growth, by acquisitions, on top of this organic and slick sales process, to grow?

Definitely, and I think that is also extremely important. Something that we have done in many companies is that you have your own business school and you try to have a very good and consistent sales organization where everybody understands the sales process very well and everyone speaks the same language, in terms of terminology or how you measure sales success.

### What is unique about Addtech and [[AddLife]] and how they make acquisitions, versus some of the bigger conglomerates like Danaher, for example?

There is obviously a big difference there when it comes to size. Danaher are buying huge enterprises, such as Leica and Beckman Coulter. But, in the end, the business model is more or less the same because it is a matter of mapping out the market and identifying your targets. You could either have a strategic acquisition approach, where you buy companies following the portfolio that you currently have. If you acquire company A, you already know that the next move is going to be to acquire company B.

Sometimes you follow an opportunistic approach where different opportunities arise, from different areas. A company might be available and you think about whether you would like to buy it and then you can do the exercise after and see how well it will fit with the rest of your portfolio.

The first key to success is really knowing your market. The second is to have an organization where everybody also has their antennae out there to listen to the market, where they can say, these companies might be worth following up. You need to have the incentives, throughout the organization. It is not only a matter of the management in the company looking at which companies are going to be acquired.

### Do you incentivize people to look for acquisitions, on the ground?

Of course. I think it is very important.

### How do you do that?

I think it is very much a question of leadership and being a good role model and walking the talk.

### Financially, do you give them an incentive?

Absolutely. You need to get people to understand that, in the end, if the company is successful then everybody is going to be successful. You also need to get them to understand that they need to take ownership and it is not just a matter of being on the payroll each month. They need to be involved in the development of the company. Of course, you can create incentives when it comes to things such as bonus schemes but I think it is also very important to have the mindset as opposed to having to always pay for everything they are doing, whether it is good or not. If you create that culture in a company, you will be very successful.

### Let’s say it’s 2030 and we’re looking back at Addtech and [[AddLife]], what could be a reason why they don’t grow at 10% per year, sustainably?

I don’t really think there are any limitations. If you look at all the companies that [[Bergman & Beving]] have acquired over the years, such as Addtech, [[Lagercrantz]], [[AddLife]], BB Tools and so on, there are more than 500 companies. You can just create new business areas and business units so you can continue growing, so there is no limitation from that perspective.

I also don’ think there is any limitation from a geographical perspective, because you could enter new geographical areas such as [[AddLife]] has done, for example, in Central Europe and Austria. There are many other countries open to them. We have always identified, from a catch-up perspective, after the Nordics that interesting areas could be the Netherlands or Benelux, because it is quite a similar culture. I would say that Germany or DACH countries and the UK were possibilities.

If you are going into other markets such as Spain, Portugal, Italy or France, it is a little more different but you could also do it.

### Why is it different?

Because the hierarchical organization is a bit different from in the Nordics or in Benelux or the UK. In countries in southern Europe, you are more the manager, whereas in the Nordics, it is more of a flat organization, so everybody can approach you when they want.

### It’s related to culture?

Yes; I think it is a cultural thing. Going back to your question, I do not think that will be many hindrances or obstacles. I would say that the only obstacle that could occur is when you no longer have a very good management. That would destroy the culture.

### Do you think the two families, in Addtech and [[AddLife]] secure that, to make sure that the management will always be aligned with the culture?

Yes, I think so. There is a continuity in the thinking. There is also a continuity on always trying to get the same mindset and culture in the company, so they do not dilute the company values, which is also key for success.

In my career, the best school for me has been Addtech. I was able to learn a lot of new things, especially when it came to acquisitions. It is a very successful business model.
