# Shane Parrish on Habits

**The biggest thing I do is that I create these automatic behaviors that put me on the path to success. Think about, almost backwards, right? What do I want to accomplish? Then ask myself, what does somebody who does that, accomplishes that, what does it look like, for them, to accomplish that?**

And so, one thing that I do is that I am not a huge fan of meetings, calls, all of that. So i don't do many podcasts, interviews... usually I'm on the other side. I am a bit shy.

I don't take meetings in the morning, usually with very few exceptions. I have nothing booked until twelve. I try to have as few meetings as possible for the team. I try to do a lot of my meetings while walking, I don't reply to every email...

I just have these little rules, and I call them rules. And I think that's an important distinction because, when they are not rules you are making a decision every time. One of the points of a habit is that you want these automatic behaviors and so you think about "How do I establish correct, automatic behaviors for myself that will put me on the path to success?"

For me it's like go to bed early, I only drink a few nights a week, I spend time with my kids cause that is success for me. There is no success if it comes at the cost of my children or my family, my parents, any of that stuff. And I think that now more than ever that has become hyper-important to be there for the kids and to not bring this stress at home.

There is a huge difference in saying "I am on a diet and I don't eat desert." If you identify with someone who doesn't eat desert, the decision has been made only once and doesn't need to be remade again and again.

Nobody argues with rules, says Daniel Kahneman. But if you are making a decision, people will argue with you.

Some of the other automatic behaviors that I have is that I never say yes on the phone, i never answer to emails past 8pm.

**What behaviors do I need to create, that will put me on the path to success?**
