Fast Moving Consumer Goods have been historically an excellent industry for shareholders' returns. By looking at their characteristics, we can derive a new kind of business dedicated to industrial clients: Fast Moving Industrial Goods.

### Fast Moving Consumer Goods
**We have to keep buying it.**
> I would rather invest in a company that makes drugs, soft drinks, razor blades, or cigarettes than in a company that makes toys. In the toy industry somebody can make a wonderful doll that every child has to have, but every child gets only one each. Eight months later that product is taken off the shelves to make room for the newest doll children have to have - manufactured by somebody else. Why take chances on fickle purchases when there is so much steady businesses around? - Peter Lynch

FMCG are usually B2C business. 
Their product attributes are:
- Repeat purchases
- Large volumes
- Low cost in relation to disposable income, creating high [[Switching costs]]
- Advertising creating a big mind share and high switching costs.

The dominant players are highly profitable (high ROE), have strong balance sheet and have been huge value creators.

### Fast Moving Industrial Goods
- Examples: gears, bearings, grinding media, welding consumables, refractories
- You have to keep buying it (ketchup in FMCG vs welding consumables in FMIG)
- Low cost in relation to disposable income reinforces loyalty (for example Gillette razor blades and Wrigley's chewing gum). In FMIG this loyalty is derived from high switching costs, i.e low cost of ownership, high cost of failure, as FMIG are mission critical (cheaper and inferior ball bearings in automobiles can lead to accidents).
- In FMCG dominant players expand their moats through investment in branding and distribution. In FMIG this is accomplished through investments in research and development.
- Dominant players in both FMCG and FMIG deliver high ROEs and have strong balance sheets
- The primary factor that drives FMCG demand is consumer spending, in FMIG the primary driver is industrial growth. This makes FMIG businesses somewhat more cyclical than FMCG businesses
