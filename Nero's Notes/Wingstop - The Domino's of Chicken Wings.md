# [[Wingstop]] - The [[Domino's]] of Chicken Wings?

There are many similarities between Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) and [[Wingstop]]’s (WING) franchise models; simple menus, 75%+ takeout mix, consistent quarterly same-store-sales growth, and low initial capex per store with great unit economics. What specifically caught our attention was [[Wingstop]]’s ~50% two-year unlevered cash return on franchise stores. This is one of the highest returns we’ve seen of any publicly listed fast-casual franchise operator. WING's underlying store economics combined with the potential for [[Wingstop]] to become the Domino’s of chicken wings led us to **[interview a Former VP with over 15 years experience at WING](https://inpractise.com/articles/wingstop-franchise-economics-chicken-sourcing-and-us-store-growth)** to discuss how WING restaurants operate and the future growth opportunity.

Founded in 1994, [[Wingstop]]’s original concept was a simple menu of chicken wings and fries served in various homemade flavors. Stores locations had maximum rents of ~$1,500 pm and opening times were limited from 4pm till late. It was the ideal retirement business. As the business has grown, opening times have extended and franchisees now operate from prime locations but the menu largely remains the same: wings, fries, and a drink.

A strikingly simple and disciplined menu is [[Wingstop]]’s secret. The company has resisted temptations to extend the menu and has maintained a relentless focus on selling the best chicken wings globally. Store operations are also optimised for the best wing eating experience; there are no heat lamps and all food is cooked to order. Every customer must wait the 14 minutes it takes to cook fresh chicken and fries. This creates a superior customer experience and is a core driver of WING's 14 years of consistent same-store-sales growth:

> _“I**f you come in, every time, and we cook your wings just for you, with the flavor you want, you get it and it’s hot.** It’s not as if we left them under the heat lamps a bit too long. If you do it properly, there’s no room for error. The fries are also cooked to order, so there is no bin holding a bunch of French fries. Sometimes, when you go out, you get great hot, crispy French fries; other times, you get soggy, limp ones. That didn’t happen at [[Wingstop]]; there were no heat lamps or places to hold food. **I think you got consistently good food; you had small, family-run businesses, so you always had good service**” - **Former VP, [[Wingstop]]**_

It’s often the simple but subtle factors that drive durable competitive advantages. Simplicity was also [[Domino's]] secret. For over 30 years, Domino’s had a simple menu with only two sizes of pizza, 11 toppings, and one beverage option, Coca Cola. These small but focused decisions compound to offer an unbeatable customer experience and consistent sales growth.

On average, a new [[Wingstop]] store requires ~$400k in initial capex which is ~$50k higher than an avergae Domino’s unit. Over the last nine years, the average revenue per WING store (AUV) has grown from $900k to over $1.6m. By the second year of operation, a typical WING store has over $1m in sales and nearly $200k in cash EBITDA. This produces a 50% unlevered 2-year cash return for franchisees. Given most franchisees will finance ~75% of the initial capex, the 2-year levered return is closer to 200%. By comparison, a typical Domino’s store generates a 3-year cash-on-cash payback with AUV’s closer to $1m and 15% EBITDA margins.

As management state, the superior economics is driven WING's Starbucks-like price point with a cost structure similar to [[Domino's]]:

> “I mentioned our premium product offering, made to order product. **We believe this allows us to charge a premium price. We are much closer, we believe, to a Starbucks, we are not KFC**... our c**osts to operate, this includes rent and labor costs, and we believe we're similar to a [[Domino's]]** in this regard.” - **VP of Strategy, WING, Investor day 2020**

Because of the underlying unit economics, WING’s US royalty rate is 6% versus 5.5% for Domino’s. If the unit returns are sustainable, it’s possible WING’s US long-term royalty rate could be closer to 7%. At 3,000 US stores, a 1% increase in the US royalty rate would generate ~$60m in incremental cash flow. At a 3% yield, this could be worth an additional $2bn in market value to WING, the equivalent of 40% of its current market cap.

The unit economics may well be great but the real question is how can [[Wingstop]]’s formula be scaled like Domino’s?

As of Q3 21, WING has 1,673 stores including 180 internationally. Domino’s has over 10x the stores globally and treble WING's US store base. [[Wingstop]]'s store count is focused in three territories; Texas, California, and Illinois. There is a stark difference in WING AUV’s across the US with West and Southwestern stores generating ~$1.5m but North and Southeastern stores only ~$880k. Management claim the reason is a lower density and younger store base but **[maybe competition is a factor:](https://inpractise.com/articles/wingstop-franchise-economics-chicken-sourcing-and-us-store-growth)**

> _"**The Southeastern United States had a wing presence with a lot of mom-and-pop wing places.** The Southeast was a tougher market to crack. The Northeast is a different animal too, because of the population densities. It’s very expensive to do business in New York City. The people that are used to going and renting a space in Texas, for $2,000, $3,000 or $4,000 a month might find that, in New York City, it’s $12,000 a month. Some of those numbers are very scary to potential investors. [[Wingstop]] is making inroads in the Northeast, but it’s still a lagging part of the country." - **Former VP, [[Wingstop]]**_

There is no other scaled QSR brand solely focused on chicken wings; Buffalo Wild Wings is a full-scale restaurant offering and the large QSR brands mainly use wings as a side dish. The competition for pizza is far more intense. In 1991, Domino’s posted its first loss after years of losing market share to Pizza Hut and Little Caesar’s. [[Wingstop]] doesn’t have a direct competitor like Pizza Hut or Papa John’s; the major competitors seem to be smaller mom-and-pop wing shops or sports bars rather than well-capitalised QSR brands.

It’s interesting to contrast WING’s opportunity with [[Domino's]] growth trajectory in the early 80’s. In 1985, only 25 years after founding, Domino’s had 2,500US and 250 international stores. For the next 13 years, the US store count grew 4.3% per year to 4,500 stores. If WING grows US stores by 4.3% per year it will reach 3,000 units in 2036.; an 8% CAGR would reach 3,000 US stores by 2030.

[[Wingstop]] today could be the equivalent of an early 1980’s Domino’s.

US store growth seems relatively simple to forecast. The average US WING franchisee runs 6 restaurants with an average tenure of 7 years. If we assume $1.5m AUV, each franchisee has over $1.8m in cash EBITDA to reinvest into new stores each year before paying off any interest. WING can grow the US store count by adding new stores with existing franchisees and finding professionals to open up new regions on multi-unit development deals. Although ~15% of DPZ US stores were company owned whereas WING only operates 2% of US stores today, WING’s US store count can compound at high-single digits for the next decade.

When studying Domino’s history, it's clear that international store openings were the major driver of growth. From 1985-98, DPZ grew international units 16% per year to 1,730 stores which then doubled again in the next decade. Today, WING has 180 stores in Mexico, UK, Singapore, Indonesia, and recently signed a 100-unit development program for Canada.

Cracking the international markets is crucial for WING to grow into the 75x FCF multiple it currently trades at.

It’s not as easy to forecast WING’s international growth. From the beginning, DPZ has run a fully vertically integrated model; it owns dough manufacturing facilities, multiple commissaries, equipment and ingredient distribution assets, and, most importantly, the last mile to the customer.

WING isn’t integrated on either end: it doesn’t any part of the supply chain or the final delivery. In the US, the company has stitched together Olo’s Rails module with an exclusive partnership with DoorDash. However, to our knowledge, Olo doesn’t currently offer the Rails module outside the US. This means WING has to effectively build a new tech stack for international stores to serve digital orders efficiently.

This could limit international store growth. However, once WING does organise the tech stack, international growth could be even quicker than DPZ. WING can leverage the scale of Deliveroo or Uber Eats much quicker than hiring drivers and running the last mile like DPZ. From 1985-95, DPZ quadrupled international stores from 200 to over 1,000. Today, WING has 180 international stores and could hit 1,000 much quicker than DPZ.

Such international growth may well be possible, however, over the last nine months, WING opened 16 international stores and closed 15. Management state this is pandemic-related but maybe it’s much more difficult to scale WING internationally relative to DPZ?

**[The other potential challenge of scaling chicken wings relative to pizza is the procurement of chicken itself:](https://inpractise.com/articles/wingstop-franchise-economics-chicken-sourcing-and-us-store-growth)**

> _"The supply chain for chicken has always been the major challenge that [[Wingstop]] faces. I think adding thighs this year proved that out. **Sourcing chicken is their biggest threat**." - Former VP, [[Wingstop]]_

Over one-third of WING’s COGS is bone-in chicken wings which are purchased on the volatile spot market. The reason wings are purchased on the spot market yet chicken breasts are bought 1-year forward seems to be because wings can't be frozen:

> _"If you look at the bone of a chicken that you’re eating, the color changes. If it’s been frozen, it’s kind of a strange color; if it’s not frozen, it’s not. It’s more appetizing. **Also, the wings come out differently. A frozen product has a lot of moisture added to it to stay tender during freezing then, when it defrosts, all this moisture comes out**. It’s a different product. It’s much better to do it with fresh chicken wings." - **Former VP, [[Wingstop]]**_

This also creates a huge challenge in pricing wings to final customers:

> _"**Everything is sold by the pound. [[Wingstop]] sells them by the piece; you buy a 10-piece or 20-piece. But they are buying it by the pound.** When the chickens are bigger, there are less wings per pound and when the chicken is smaller, there are more wings per pound. That is just a challenge than [[Wingstop]] has had and it’s always going to be just because chickens grow at different rates, are different sizes and how they manufacture and kill them is all part of that." - **Former VP, [[Wingstop]]**_

This is a risk to WING's growth because higher wing prices can reduce the value proposition relative to other fast-casual concepts. The company’s ‘whole bird strategy’ looks to mitigate this risk by shifting the product mix towards more boneless tenders and thighs which can be purchased in advance with lower price volatility.

This also gets to an interesting question: why did KFC, McDonald’s, and Chic-fil-A allow WING to own the chicken wings?

What if one of the larger players rolls out a strong wing offering which reduces wing supply? Maybe the size and power of KFC could distort the wing supply which could price [[Wingstop]] out of the market? After all, WING’s price positioning is over 50% higher than McDonald’s or KFC. Persistently higher wing costs could structurally impair [[Wingstop]]'s value proposition relative to competitors.

Relative to DPZ, it’s clear WING has far less control over the core inputs to run its business. It not only relies on 3P delivery and technology companies but is also at the mercy of a volatile raw material market. However, the differentiated product, superior unit economics, and lack of a clear competitor provides [[Wingstop]] with a multi-decade growth opportunity.

WING has a great chance of being the Domino’s of chicken wings. DPZ added 500 stores per year throughout the 1980’s from a similar store count as WING today. At 75x 2022 FCF, WING is pricing in much of this future growth but the opportunity to leverage royalty income on a novel global food dish is hard to come by. Over the last 20 years, the return profile of a levered royalty on pizza sales kept pace with the best businesses the world has ever seen. Maybe a levered chicken wing royalty will set the pace for the next 20 years?
