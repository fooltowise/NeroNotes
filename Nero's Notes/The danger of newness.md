In some industries, history is less important. Nintendo is one of the most iconic [[brands]] in video gaming. Founded as a playing card manufacturer in 1889, it produced its first video game in 1977 and owns video-game icons like Super Mario. Yet, before finding partial redemption with its Wii product, it floundered. By the early 2000s, newer rivals such as Microsoft XBox and Sony Playstation had overtaken it. The fact that Microsoft was only founded in 1981 or that Playstation was launched in 1994 did not matter. Superior innovation from competitors diminished brand appeal.

The Nintendo case illustrates how brands are more vulnerable when novelty and fast-changing technologies play a large role in the benefits it offers. Innovation-driven vulnerability extends beyond technology to affect many industries, such as the fast-changing world of fashion. Innovation is a perennial challenge for apparel brands.
