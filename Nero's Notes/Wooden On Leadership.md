# Wooden on Leadership

- What's his secret? Coach Wooden taught good habits. That's it. That's the answer.
- Leadership is all about helping others to achieve their own greatness by helping the organization to succeed.


"***Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable.***


"Don't worry about whether you're better than somebody else, but never cease trying to be the best you can become. You have control over that; the other you don't."

The joy is in the journey of pushing yourself to the outward limits of your ability and teaching your organization to do the same.


I do not judge success based on championships; rather, I judge it on how close we came to realizing our potential.


### Rules to lead by:
- **Before you can lead others, you must be able to lead yourself**. Define success for those under your leadership as total commitment and effort to the team's welfare. Then show it yourself with your own effort and performance. Most of those you lead will do the same. Those who don't should be encouraged to look for a new team.
- **Don't hastily replace the old fashioned with the new fangled**. There is no progress without change, but not all change is progress. Those ideas that have stood the test of time should not be carelessly discarded just for the sake of change. 
- **Learn to master the Four P's.** The Four P's are Planning, Preparation, Practice, and Performance. These are the keys to successful execution. Learn to live the Four P's yourself, always giving them the highest priority, above even winning. It is the responsibility of the leader to make sure the team puts the Four P's first.
- **Write down the tasks, initiatives, and actions that each member of your team needs to do to perform at his or her peak level.** Get as specific as possible for each of your direct reports. Don't make the mistake of overemphasizing results ("increase sales by 15%"). Instead, focus on those actions that an individual needs to take in order to most effectively and productively execute his or her assignment ("spend 20 percent more time with customers, make five more calls per week, or take a course in presentation skills.")



## The Pyramid of Success

#### Industriousness
The first block was self-evident : hard work. I called it Industriousness, because "work" as performed by most people isn't real work; rather, it's going through the motions, putting in time, enduring boredom. I have something else in mind, the kind of work in which you are fully engaged, totally focused, and completely absorbed. There is no clock watching and no punching in and out. Industriousness, for me, means true work.

#### Enthusiasm

Work without joy is drudgery. Drudgery does not produce champions, nor does it produce great organizations. Enthusiasm is the second cornerstone of the pyramid because it transforms work into Industriousness and catapults you to most productive heights.

#### Friendship
The two qualities of friendship so important for a leader to possess and instill in team members are respect and camaraderie. Camaraderie is a spirit of goodwill that exists between individuals and members of a group - comrades in arms. Think of how much you'll give when asked to do so by someone you respect and with whom you share camaraderie. You'll give plenty - everything you've got.


#### Loyalty
It is impossible to be a good leader without loyalty to your organization. Loyalty starts with Loyalty to yourself - your standards, your system, your values. First, do not betray yourself. Second, do not betray those you lead. This is Loyalty.

I believe most people, the overwhelming majority of us, wish to be in an organization whose leadership cares about them, provides fairness and respect, dignity and consideration. Do so and you find loyalty in abundance from those you lead. You will find yourself in charge of an organization that will not waffle in the wind.


#### Cooperation

As a leader you must be sincerely committed to what's right rather than who's right. For this to occur, cooperation must be present. An effective leader understands that it is a sign of strength to welcome honest differences and new ways of thinking form those on your team as well as from others. Progress is difficult when you won't listen. Cooperation is impossible if we refuse to consider the merits of contrary opinions.


#### Self-Control
To be a true leader requires credibility and consistency in one's actions, and this is hard to achieve when you lack self-control. It starts with control of your emotions, but it also extends to having the resolve to resist the easy choice, the expedient solution, and, at times, temptation in its various and alluring forms.

#### Alertness
Alertness, the ability to be constantly observing, absorbing, and learning from what's going on around you, is a critical component for the individual in charge, the leader who strives for continuous improvement. You must constantly be awake, alive, and alert in evaluating yourself as well as the strengths and weaknesses of your organization and your competitors. 

My father used to remind me that most of what I'd learn would come from others. This can only happen if you're alert and aware.

#### Initiative
A basketball team that won't risk mistakes will not outscore opponents. The same is true for any organization. Don't leave in fear of making a mistake. The team that makes the most mistakes usually wins. The kinds of mistakes i am referring to are not the result of carelessness or sloppiness but the result of assertive action based on proper assessment of risk. Failure to act is often the biggest failure of all.


#### Intentness

I chose the word intentness to convey diligence and determination, fortitude and resolve - persistence. When intentness exists in you, it also exists in your organization. The reverse is also true.

Intentness also implies a firm resolve to stay the course over the long term rather than meandering all over the place in bursts of short-lived activity. Intentness keeps you in the game even when others tell you the game is over.


#### Condition

To achieve one's potential as a leader in any organization you need mental and moral strength. In fact, you cannot attain proper physical fitness unless it's preceded by mental and moral condition. (by moral condition i mean practice moderation and balance in all that you do. All the hard work we did can be torn down quickly if you make the wrong choices between now and our next practice.)


You may have observed how those who weaken themselves physically often fall prey to an assortment of lapses in the area of good judgment. Being in good physical, mental and moral condition is essential to being a consistently effective and productive leader. Physical fitness is crucial. So is mental and moral fitness.


#### Skill

You must know all facets of your job - not just parts of it - and be able to execute quickly and correctly. Being prepared to do all that your job requires will quickly separate you and your organization from much of the competition.
Regardless of the specific skills required in a profession, you must master all of them.

The best leaders are lifelong learners. They take measure to create organizations that foster and inspire  learning throughout. The most effective leaders are those who realize it's what you learn after you know it all that counts most.


#### Team Spirit
The star of the team is the team. Each player should be eager to sacrifice personal interests for the good of the group.

Individuals don't win games, teams do. 

#### Poise
I define *poise* as being true to oneself, not getting rattled, thrown off, or unbalanced regardless of the circumstance or situation. Leaders lacking poise panic under pressure. Poise means holding fast to your beliefs and acting in accordance with them, regardless of how bad or good the situation may be.

When poise is present, you'll perform at your own personal best because it precludes panic. You'll understand what you're supposed to do - and do it even when the odds are against you, even when everyone else says you'll fail.

You don't acquire poise. Poise acquire you. It is part of the harvest you reap near the top of the pyramid.


#### Confidence
There is perhaps no stronger steel than well-founded self-belief: the knowledge that your preparation is complete, that you have done all things possible to ready yourself and your organization for the competition, whatever form it comes in. **You must earn the right to be confident.**


#### Competitive Greatness
For more than half a century I have defined Competitive Greatness as follows: "A real love for the hard battle, knowing it offers the opportunity to be at your best when your best is required." The hard struggle is to be welcomed, never feared. In fact, when you define success this way, the only thing to fear is your own unwillingness to make the full, 100 percent effort to prepare and perform at the highest level of your ability.



## Lessons in Leadership


- Leadership is about more than just forcing people to do what you say.  A prison guard does that. A good leader creates belief - in the leaders's philosophy, in the organization, the mission. Creating belief is difficult to do where a vacuum of values exists, where the only thing that matters is the end result, whether it's beating the competition on the court or increasing the profit margins in the books.


- **It's tough to coach character**. When parents asked, "Coach Wooden, will you be able to teach character to my son?" I told them no. If they didn't have it, I couldn't give it to them. While you, the leader, can teach many things, character is not taught easily to adults who arrive at your desk lacking it. Be cautious about taking on "reclamation projects" regardless of the talent they may possess. Have the courage to make character count among the qualities you seek in others.

- **Character starts with little things**. Remember the T-shirts. Every leader should create his or her agenda of things that make a difference. It could be everything from being punctual to completing projects on deadline. But it could also be something a bit subtler, such as how a manager talks to an employee or administrative assistant. The important thing is to let people know what you expect of them and to inform individuals when they violate your code, values, or standards.

- **Character is more than honesty**. An individual can be honest as the day is long and still be short on character. How? He or she can be honest but selfish, honest but undisciplined, honest but unfair, honest but disrespectful, or honest but lazy. Honesty is a good place to start, but it doesn't stop there. There's more to character than just telling the truth - for both leaders and those on the team.

- **Beware those who'll do whatever it takes to win.** Winning at any cost can be very costly - fatal, in fact. A good set of values is part of successful leadership and great organizations. Be wary of those who will do anything to win. This is not the attitude of a great competitor, but rather of a competitor who is greatly flawed. Find those who love the battle and play by the rules.

- **Lead with Love**. Great organizations are marked by an extraordinary bond within. For me, that bond included genuine love, and I didn't feel awkward about it. I put my heart into my work and those with whom I worked. Teams with a sense of family have uncommon strength and resiliency. A good family - whether in life, sports, or business - involves love. A reminder: it also involves good structure, sensible discipline, and personal sacrifice.
- **You don't have to treat everyone alike or like everyone the same.** You may have favorites within your organization, but never replace fairness with favoritism. To be impartial, give each individual the treatment he or she earns and deserves.

- **Seek out opportunities to show you care.** The small considerations often mean the most - a genuine expression of interest or concern, a helpful hand, individual recognition. I didn't place a wall between my professional and personal life, and at appropriate times I invited players and coaches to our home. I knew about their families and their challenges away from basketball. Oftentimes, it really is the thought that counts most.

- **Know what time it is.** With regard to policy, effective leadership recognizes that there is a time to be flexible and a time to be firm. recognize the difference between rules that can be waived occasionally and those that o to the core of your philosophy. For example, my dress code had repercussions beyond the individual; replacing steak with beans and yogurt didn't. Knowing the difference is often most challenging. However, a good leader knows what time it is: Time to be flexible? Time to be firm?


- Whether in class or on the court, my job was the same: to effectively teach those under my supervision how they could perform to the best of their ability in ways that best served the team. I believe the same is true for productive leaders in any organization.


- **Do not equate professional expertise with your ability to teach it.** There's a big difference between knowing what you're doing and knowing how to teach what you want done - in all areas. A great basketball player bay be unable to teach others how to play great basketball, just as an outstanding salesperson may be inept at teaching others how to sell. In your ongoing efforts to increase your knowledge within the profession, don't overlook improving your ability to be a better teacher.

- **When you start having all the right answers, you will stop asking the right questions.** The path to success lies in the realization that there is always more to learn. Strive to create an environment where individual continually seek knowledge that will benefit their team, where you and those in the organization aren't afraid to ask questions - to admit, "I don't know." Remember, the best CEOs are often those credited with developing "learning institutions". Take meaningful steps to make this a reality. Invite managers from other companies to speak to your people on a key topic. Encourage others to take relevant courses and, most of all, lead by example; specifically, let those you lead see their leader continually learning.
- **Remember that a good demonstration tops a great description**. This adage is most apparent in sports, but it applies equally elsewhere. Memos, discussions, and verbal instructions have merit. Demonstration, however, is often the most effective tool for change.

- **Control emotion or emotion will control you.** Intensity, correctly applied and directed, produces consistent and positive improvement and results. Uncontrolled emotion or mercurial displays of temperament erode a leader's stature, lessen respect from others, and will undermine your team's efforts. the leader who does not know the difference between intensity and emotionalism may succeed on occasion, but the success will usually not be repeatable,  reliable, or ongoing.
- **Avoid excess. Shoot for moderation.** In my opinion, effective leaders understand that moderation and balance are linked to long-term success. excess in just about anything has the potential to create erratic performance. Communicate this fact throughout the ranks, and, or course, don't forget that your own example is frequently the very best method of communication.
- **Instill emotional discipline.** Much of the overwrought behavior we see in sports today is the result of insufficient discipline. For example, a football player putting on a big show of celebration after making a tackle when his team is losing 27 to 3 late in the fourth quarter is demonstrating poor judgment, bad perspective, and lack of emotional discipline - characteristics I do not associate with success. It is up to you, the leader, to insist that those in the organization demonstrate the same great emotional control that you have. Do you have it?

- **The star of the team is the team**. As leader, you must be consistent and persistent in delivering your Team First message. Top performers and producers must fully comprehend that others in the organization "assist" - make possible - their success. Individual awards and accolades are fine, but they must never overshadow the organization and its primacy. Remember Walton and Alcindor: As talented as they were - All Americans - they put the team's welfare first.
- **Insist that Members of your Team share the "ball" - Information, Ideas, and More**. The most effective leaders understand the importance of making sure that no member of the team hoards data, information, ideas, and the like. In business, it is the sharing of ideas and putting them to work that leads to a "best practice" mindset.
- **Go out of your way to praise those quiet performers who make things happen**. In every organization there are those vital individuals who seem to get things done with little effort and less notice. In more cases than not, however, these key players work very hard to achieve what they do. Often their efforts are not visible to the group. these are the people that make the trains run on time, and they deserve your attention.

- **Seek players who will make the best team rather than the best players.** Astute leadership understands the chemistry of teams and organizations. Often the most talented individuals will not be a good fit for your group. be alert to overall impact - chemistry. Remember future All-American Sydney Wicks, who achieved personal greatness soon after he began putting the team first.

- **It all starts with the socks**. Success begins from the ground up. It never bothered me to be chided over my commitment to doing the little thing right. make sure that you and your team put their "socks" on in the correct manner.

- **The right rivets are essential**. There are not big things, only an accumulation of many little things. Remove enough rivets and the wing falls off. However, it is up to you, the leader, to identify the corrects rivets and determine how much attention each will be given. Do this correctly and your organization will survive flying through even the most turbulent competitive storm. 

- **Nourish talent in an environment of perfected details.** Only then will your team achieve consistent success. Remember that talent alone will not suffice. Each year in sports and business we see talented team - and individuals - fail because of neglected details.

- **Sloppiness breeds sloppiness.** From the first moment of the first day of UCLA's season, I insisted we do things right - not almost right, but completely right. It's an attitude, a way of conducting business. A casual approach to executing the details of a job ensures that the job will be done poorly. And then another job will be done poorly. It grows.

- **Remember that a great quarter in basketball or business starts with a great minute**. A well-organized leader has finished his fourth cup of coffee before a poorly organized leader has located the coffeepot. Your fist minutes working with a team or on a vital project can determine your ultimate success. Lead with the certain knowledge that you don't have a moment to lose.

- **Set the proper tone with meticulous time management technique.** A leader who is careless about time sanctions the same attitude throughout the organization. Time is about more than the clock. It is about creating and fostering an environment in which discipline and hustle rule over carelessness and a casual attitude about time.

- **Document Minutes, Days, Weeks, Months, and so on.** In reviewing the details of UCLA practice schedules form prior years, I was looking to see what worked at precise intervals throughout the season. Doing so helped me to keep the team moving forward. I learned from and incorporated past lessons. Those records were most helpful in showing me how not to waste time. Keep good, meaningful records. use them to help you find ways to improve.

- **Pride is easier to instill with the carrot.** The best leaders perhaps understand this fact intuitively. Members of an organization always fearful of penalty and punishment are at a great disadvantage when competing against a team filled with pride. This is so particularly over the long haul.

- **Make sure all praise is genuine and appropriate**. Just as damaging as biting personal criticism is the compliment given but not meant. Your praise will have impact only to the extent that it is given honestly and in good faith. Anything else is usually perceived as such and becomes counterproductive.


- **Do not tolerate internal carping and criticism.** Leaders should be solely responsible for critiquing and criticizing members of the team. the purpose of criticism is to correct, improve, and change. It is not to humiliate, demean, or punish. It is a task that requires  great skill and judgment and is best left in the hands of able management and coaches.


- **Don't lock yourself into rigid penalties.** Successful leaders understand that it is important to have options. This allows you to tailor the response to each situation. Still, when it comes to the most important rules, it is wise to have clearly understood penalties attached. Common sense, however, must always have a place in your decisions. What is fair is more important than what is right.

- **Each job counts**. All roles on a team offer the opportunity for individual greatness. This idea will be understood and accepted only if the leader reinforces it on a consistent basis. everyone must feel that his or her contributions count and affect the success, or lack thereof, of the team.

- **Encourage, but manage, ambition.** Ambition can be valuable characteristic in a team member. However, those who aspire to advancement and greater responsibility should be cautioned that it will occur only if they master their current position. No member of the team should be allowed to let future opportunities distract from present responsibilities.

- **Teach your players to expect unexpected opportunity.** Unforeseen opportunity may for many reasons. In basketball, it might be because a starter fouls out or is injured. In business, it may occur when the company wins a new account or acquires a competitor, or because an employee leaves the firm. The key is to make sure that those under your supervision are ready, mentally, and physically, when that opportunity avails itself. Let everyone know that advancement often comes with little or no warning. They must be prepared to seize the opportunity when it presents itself (or it may not present itself again).

- **Believe in the hidden potential of all.** Create an environment that rewards hard work and improvement and you unleash the unseen talents of those you lead. Employees - team members - who feel they can better themselves by doing a great job and helping the team will work at the highest level. Often it will come from a member of your organization from whom you may least expect it. Your job as a leader is to get the best from each member of your unit, to tap into that concealed reservoir of talent. A leader who effectively taps into potential is potent.

- **Success breeds satisfaction; Satisfaction breeds failure**. A leader must set realistic goals, but once they are achieved, you must not become satisfied. Achievement will continue at the same or a greater level only if you do not permit the infection of success to take hold of you and your organization. the symptom of that infection is called complacency. Contentment with past accomplishment or acceptance of the status quo can derail an organization quickly. In sports or business, getting to the top is difficult. One of the reasons staying there is so rare is because the infection sets in.

- **Identify and remove excuses for not getting to the next level.** Only when I realized that it was me - and not the Men's Gym - that was holding the team back was I able to raise the level of our effort in all areas. What is your "Men's Gym"?
- **Stop saying No and start saying How?**  Assume improvement is always possible and force yourself - and others- to find out how. A leader who thinks he or she has all the answers has stopped asking questions. When you've asked, "How can I help our team to improve?" a thousand times, ask it again.

- **Welcome contrary ideas, but not contrarians.** New ideas and perspective from those under your leadership are essential for achieving and maintaining a competitive edge. Welcome those people strong enough to speak up and offer alternatives and ideas. Beware those who do it in an manner that crosses the line, who challenge your overall philosophy or your leadership itself. Look for solid leaders like coaches Crum, Powell, Norman, and Cunningham, who knew how to engage in a robust exchange of ideas and opinion without causing disruption or challenging authority.

- **Identify team goals, then file them away.** As leader, it is most challenging to keep yourself and your team from becoming distracted by future challenges, opportunities, rewards, and consequences. I rarely mentioned the upcoming opponent in my comments to the team during the week. the same was true of the standings of playoff possibilities. All that existed in the future. Improvement exists in the present, not the future.

- **Give full respect to each competitor.** While I seldom altered our practice or game plan based on the competition, I wanted players to have respect for the abilities of all opponents. I never took any game or opponent for granted. The same should hold in business. Respect all; fear none. This is not easy to do. When you're down looking up, fear is natural. When you're up looking down - leading the competition - respect for all is often most elusive.


- **Long-term success requires short-term focus**. This goes in the hear of my "don't look at the scoreboard" imperative. It is key to my leadership methodology. Focus on improvement - now. Not tomorrow, not next week. Let's get it done today.

- **Always assume adversity.** All leaders and organizations are blind-sided by bad luck and misfortune in various ways at various times. The best leaders understand this and are seldom thrown off stride when it occurs. They recognize the opportunity it presents, namely, that your response can separate you and your organization from the competition whose leader is stunned and then disheartened when fate frowns. Expect the rough patches and allow them to make you stronger.

- **Don't make "woe is me" your fight song.** Leaders cannot allow themselves to be sidetracked by self-pity. Accurate self-assessment and team assessment is linked to success. This activity is impossible when you are bogged down in feeling sorrow for yourself, in denouncing misfortune. Make the best of what you've got. Play the cards you are dealt. Walt Disney once said: "There is no education like adversity". However, to gain this education you must be tough enough to overcome adversity rather than allowing adversity to overcome you.

- **Don't blame failure on fate.** You can stumble and fall, make errors and mistakes, but **you are not a failure until you start blaming others,** including fate, for your results. Always believe there is a positive to be found in the negative. Things usually happen for a reason, even when you are unable to discern the reason. Remember, "there is providence even in the fall of a sparrow."
