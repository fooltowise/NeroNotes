# Give Honest and Sincere Appreciation

**There is only one way to get anybody to do anything. And that is by making the other person want to do it.**

Except for sex, the deepest urge in human nature is **the desire to be important**. 

> The deepest craving in human nature is the **craving** to be appreciated. - William James.

It is not a wish, nor a desire, nor a longing. It is a **craving** to be appreciated.

One of the first people to be paid a salary of over a million dollar a year was Charles Schwab, whom Andrew Carnegie had picked to become the first president of the newly formed United States Steel Company in 1921. Schwab explained his success with the following words:

> I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people the greatest asset I possess, **and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement**. There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticism from superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.


When a study was made a few years ago on runaway wives, what do you think was discovered to be the main reason wives ran away? It was **lack of appreciation.**

The difference between appreciation and flattery is that the first one is sincere.

**Try leaving a friendly trail of little sparks of gratitude on your daily trips.**
You will be surprised how they will set small flames of friendship that will be rose beacons on your next visit.

**Principle 2: Give honest and sincere appreciation.**
