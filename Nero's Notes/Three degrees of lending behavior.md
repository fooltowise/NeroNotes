The economist Hyman Minsky has separated lending behaviors into three categories:

- *Hedge finance,* where the borrower is able to cover both the interest rate of the loan and repayment of the principal with his current cash flows.
- *Speculative finance*, where the borrower can only cover the interest rate. To repay the principal, the borrower relies on the capital appreciation of his collateral to be able to refinance
- *Ponzi finance*, where the borrower is not even able to cover the interest rate from current cash flows.
