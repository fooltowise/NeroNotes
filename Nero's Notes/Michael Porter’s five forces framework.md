# Michael Porter's Five Forces Framework
### **Porter’s Five Forces**
1. Bargaining power of suppliers
2. Bargaining power of buyers
3. Threat of new entrants
4. Threat of substitute products
5. Rivalry among industry participants

The first two forces emphasize the influence of suppliers and buyers on a company’s competitive position. The third and fourth characterize the extent to which a company is threatened by competitive forces that may appear within the industry or in related industries. The final force describes the intensity of competition within an industry. In addition to these, some strategists would complement or further parse Porter’s list to reflect the actions of the government, strategic alliances, technological lock-in and switching costs, network effects and positive feedback loops, standardization, and other industry characteristics that are conducive to one company’s garnering an outsized share of economic profits.
