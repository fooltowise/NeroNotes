# Deep Work

### by Cal Newport

**Deep work:** Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate.

**Shallow Work**: Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate.

**The Deep Work Hypothesis:** The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.


**How to become a winner in the new economy:**
Two core abilities for thriving in the new economy:
- The ability to quickly master hard things
- The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality and speed

## The rules of Deep Work
### 1. Work deeply
Decide on your depth philosophy:
- **The Monastic philosophy of deep work**: attempts to maximize deep efforts by eliminating or radically minimizing shallow obligations. Practitioners of the monastic philosophy tend to have a well-defined and highly valued professional goal that they're pursuing, and the bulk of their professional success comes from doing this one thing exceptionally well. It's this clarity that helps them eliminate the thicket of shallow concerns that tend to trip up those whose value proposition in the working world is more varied.
- **The Bimodal philosophy of deep work scheduling**: this mode believes that deep work can produce extreme productivity, *but only* if the subject dedicates enough time to such endeavors to reach maximum cognitive intensity - the state in which real breakthroughs occur. This is why the minimum unit of time for deep work in this philosophy tends to be at least one full day. To put aside a few hours in the morning, for example, is too short  to count as a deep work stretch for an adherent of this approach.
- **The Rhythmic philosophy of deep work scheduling**: this philosophy argues that the easiest way to consistently start deep work sessions is to transform them into a simple regular habit. The goal, in other words, is to generate a rhythm for this work that removes the need for you to invest energy in deciding if and when you're going to go deep. 
- **The journalistic philosophy of deep work scheduling**: this approach is not for the deep work novice. Any time you can find some free time, you switch into a deep work mode and hammer away at your task. The name is a nod to the fact that journalists like Walter Isaacson are trained to shift into a writing mode on a moment's notice, as is required by the deadline-driven nature of their profession.

### Ritualize
To make the most out of your deep works sessions, build rituals of the same level of strictness and idiosyncrasy as the important thinkers like Caro or Darwin:
- Where you'll work and for how long
- How you'll work once you start to work
- How you'll support your work

See [[Rituals]]

### Execute like a business
**Focus on the wildly important**. The more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish. Execution should be aimed at a small number of wildly important goals. This simplification will help focus an organization's energy to a sufficient intensity to ignite real results. For an individual focused on deep work, the implication is that you should identify a small number of ambitious outcomes to pursue with your deep work hours. 

**Act on the Lead measures**. Once you've identified a wildly important goal, you need to measure your success. There are two types of metrics for this purpose: lag measures and lead measures. Lag measures describe the thing you're ultimately trying to improve. The problem with lag measures is that they come too late to change your behavior. "When you receive them, the performance that drove them is already in the past." Lead measures, on the other hand, measure the new behaviors that will drive success on the lag measures. Lead measures turn your attention to improving the behaviors you directly control in the near future that will then have a positive impact on your long-term goals. For an individual focused on deep work, it's easy to identify the relevant lead measure: *time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal.*

**Keep a compelling scoreboard**. People play differently when they're keeping score. It follows that the individual's scoreboard should be a physical artifact in the workspace that displays the individual's current work hour count. In my early experiments, I settled on a simple but effective solution for implementing this scoreboard. I took a piece of card stock and divided it into rows, one for each week of the current semester. I then labeled each row with the dates of the week and taped it to the wall next to my computer monitor (where it couldn't be ignored). As each week progressed, I kept track of the hours spend in deep work that week with a simple tally of tick marks in that week's row. 

**Create a cadence of accountability**. I recommend the habit of a weekly review in which you make a plan for the workweek ahead. I used a weekly review to look over my scoreboard to celebrate good weeks, help understand what led to bad weeks, and most important, figure out how to ensure a good score for the days ahead.

### Be lazy
Don't forget to have downtime. Deep work is cognitively taxing and you need rest.
- Downtime aids insights
- Downtime helps recharge the energy needed to work deeply
- The work that evening downtime replaces is usually not important 



### 2. Embrace boredom
**Don't take breaks from distraction, instead take breaks from focus.**  Schedule in advance when you'll use the internet (note: here the author means the distracting part of the internet), and then avoid it altogether outside these times. I suggest that you keep a notepad near your computer at work. On this pad, record the next time you're allowed to use the Internet. Until you arrive at that time, absolutely no network connectivity is allowed, no matter how tempting.

**Work like Teddy Roosevelt**. Identify a deep task (that is, one that requires deep work to complete) that's high on your priority list. Estimate how long you'd normally put aside for an obligation of this type, then give yourself a hard deadline that drastically reduces this time. If possible, commit publicly to the deadline. At this point, there should be only one possible way to get the deep task done in time: working with great intensity - no email break, no daydreaming, no Facebook browsing, no repeated trips to the coffee machine. Like Roosevelt at Harvard, attack the task with every free neuron until it gives way under your unwavering barrage of concentration.

**Meditate Productively**. The goal of productive meditation is to take a period in which you're occupied physically but not mentally - walking, jogging, driving, showering - and focus your attention on a single well-defined professional problem. Depending on your profession, this problem might be outlining an article, writing a talk, making progress on a proof, or attempting to sharpen a business strategy. As in mindfulness meditation, you must continue to bring your attention back to the problem at hand when it wanders or stalls.

**Memorize a deck of cards**.  A side effect of memory training is an improvement in your general ability to concentrate. This ability can then be fruitfully applied to any task demanding deep work.


### 3. Quit Social Medial
**The craftsman approach to tool selection**: Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts.

**Apply the law of the vital few to your internet habits**. 
The first step of the strategy is to identify the main high level goals in both your professional and  your personal life. If you have a family, for example, then your personal goals might involve parenting well and running an organized household. In the professional sphere, the details of these goals depend on what you do for a living. The key is to keep the list limited to what's most important and to keep the descriptions suitably high-level.

Once you've identified these goals, list for each the two or three most important activities that help you satisfy the goal. These activities should be specific enough to allow you to clearly picture doing them. On the other hand, they should be general enough that they're not tied to a onetime outcome. 

The next step in this strategy is to consider the network tools you currently use. For each such tools, go through the key activities you identified and ask whether the use of the tool has a substantially positive impact, a substantially negative impact, or little impact on your regular and successful participation of the activity. Now comes the important decision: keep using this tool only if you concluded that it has substantial positive impacts and that these outweigh the negative impacts.

**The law of the Vital Few** (or Pareto Principle, or Power Law): In many settings, 80% of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible causes.

So you should focus on the 20 percent that provides most of the results.

**Don't use the Internet to entertain yourself**

Avoid at all costs entertainment-focused websites designed to capture and hold your attention for as long as possible.  Examples: Huffington Post, Buzzfeed, Business Insider, and Reddit.

**Put more thoughts into your leisure time**. In other words, when it comes to your relaxation, don't default to whatever catches your attention at the moment, but instead dedicate some advance thinking to the question of how you want to spend your "day within a day".


### 4. Drain the Shallows
**Schedule every minute of your day**. At the beginning of each workday, turn to a new page of lined paper in a notebook you dedicate to this purpose. Down the left-hand side of the page, mark every other line with an hour of the day, covering the full set of hours your typically work. Divide the hours of your workday into blocks and assign activities to the blocks. 
When you're done scheduling your day, every minute should be part of a block. 
Then two things can and likely will go wrong. Your estimates will prove wrong, and you'll be interrupted and new obligations will unexpectedly appear on your plate. This is Okay.

Your goal is not to stick to a given schedule at all costs. it's instead to maintain, at all time, a thoughtful say in what you're doing with your time going forward - even if these decisions are reworked again and again as the day unfolds.

You can use *overflow conditional blocks* if you are not sure how long a given activity might take.


**Quantify the depth of every activity**
To quantify the depth of each activity, ask this question: *How long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?*


**Become hard to reach**
- Make people who send you e-mail do more work.
- Do more work when you send or reply to emails. Be very specific in what you expect from you and your contact. *What is the project represented by this message, and what is the most efficient (in terms of message generated) process for bringing this project to a successful conclusion?*
- Don't respond
