# Thinking via the Index

Zak and I have witnessed many investors make terrible investment decisions from thinking via the index.

The most common mistake is to view the index (indeed any index?) as a risk-free "home". that this disposition still exists after the irrational index bubbles that preceded the Asian crisis and technology collapse may be testament to the strength of the marketing skills of the financial establishment. Once the index is seen as risk free the mistakes that follow cascade and include: requirement to have an opinion on everything inside the index regardless of one's circle of competence, an unwillingness to invest in other better opportunities, and over diversification.

These three mistakes destroy a lot of capital. We came across one country manager's report claiming that although his country had done poorly it had proved valuable as a "portfolio diversifier" in a global fund. Many a furrowed brow these last few weeks figuring out what that means! **Even so, index relative funds are the industry norm because they sell. And they sell because the client does not trust their manager with the keys to the Ferrari. It is a ghastly Faustian pact.**
