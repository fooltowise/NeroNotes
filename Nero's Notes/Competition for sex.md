From the perspective of [[Evolution - Natural Selection and Extinction]], mating, not survival, is the name of the game.

In the human species, each of the two sexes faces competition primarily from other members of their sex. Every woman who wants to (monogamously) mate with a high-quality man has to compete with all other women, while every man who wants to mate with a woman has to be chosen by her, ahead of all his rivals.

The competitive aspect of courtship implies that both men and women will be keen to [[Biological Signaling|advertise themselves]] on the mating market. We want potential mates to know that we have good genes and that we'll make good parents.
