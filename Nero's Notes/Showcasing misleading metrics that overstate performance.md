# Showcasing misleading metrics that overstate performance

### Highlighting a misleading metric as surrogate for revenue

- Same store sales:
  - Definition can change from one quarter to another. Watch for changes in the definition of same-store sales
  - Compare same-store sales to the change in revenue per store
  - Pay close attention to which parts of the business reported growth reflects
- ARPU:
  - Varying definitions of ARPU abound. Make sure to check what is the company's definition of ARPU
- Bookings and backlog:
  - Check if the following definition applies:
    - Beginning backlog + Net Bookings - Revenue = Ending backlog

### Highlighting a misleading metric as surrogate for earnings

- Ebitda and its variations:
  - Pretending that recurring charges are one-time in nature
  - Watch for clever games to inflate ebitda

#### Highlighting a misleading metric as surrogate for cash flow

- Cash earnings and Ebitda are not cash flow metrics
- Non Gaap Cash flow metrics may be put there to confuse
