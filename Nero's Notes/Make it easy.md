- The Third Law of Behavior Change is _Make is Easy_
- **The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning**
- Focus on taking action, not being in motion
- Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition
- **The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it**

- Most of us are experts at avoiding criticism. it doesn't feel good to fail or to be judged publicly, so we tend to avoid situations where that might happen. **And that's the biggest reason why you slip into motion rather than taking action: you want to delay failure.**

- Human behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.
- Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible
- Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy.
- Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult.
- Prime your environment to make future actions easier

- Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward
- Many habits occur at decisive moments - choices that are like a fork in the road - and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one.
- The two-minute rules states "When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do."
- The more you ritualize the beginning of the process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things
- Standardize before you optimize. You can't improve a habit that does not exist.

- The inversion of the third law of behavior change is _Make is difficult_
- A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future
- The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to automate your habits
- Onetime choices - like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan - are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time.
- Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior
