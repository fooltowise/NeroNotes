## by Seneca

- You can make the same point that rich and poor suffer equal distress: for both groups cling to their money and suffer if it is torn away from them. But, as I said, **it is easier to bear and simpler not to acquire than to lose, so you will notice that those people are more cheerful whom Fortune has never favored than those whom she has deserted.**

- He [the Wise] has no reason to fear her [Fortune], since he regards as held on sufferance not only his goods and possessions and status, but even his body, his eye and hand, and all that makes life more dear, and his very self; and he lives as though he were lent to himself and bound to return the loan on demand without complaint. [...] He will say: "I thank you for what I have possessed and held. I have looked after your property to my great benefit, but at your command I give and yield it with gratitude and good will. If you want me to have anything of yours I shall keep it safe. if you wish otherwise, I give back and restore to you my silver, both coined and plate, my house and my household."

- What can happen to one can happen to all. If you let this idea sink into your vitals, and regards the ills of other people (of which every day shows an enormous supply) as having a clear path to you too, you will be armed long before you are attacked.

- Let all your activity be directed to some object, let it have some end in view. It is not industry that makes men restless, but false impressions of things drive them mad.

- Our minds must relax: they will rise better and keener after a rest. Just as you must not force fertile farmland, as uninterrupted productivity will soon exhaust it, so constant effort will sap our mental vigor, while a short period of rest and relaxation will restore our powers.
