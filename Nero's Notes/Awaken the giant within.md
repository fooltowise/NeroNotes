# Awaken the Giant Within

## by Tony Robbins


### Main points:

1. Decision will shape your future. The most important decisions are:
	1. **What to focus on**
	2. **What things mean to you**
	3. **What to do to get from where you are to where you want to be**
2.  Use pain as a leverage to get rid of destructive behaviors.  
3.  Ask questions that empower you.  
4. Set goals, set time lines, make plans, and achieve them.  
5. Understand that goals are a means to the end of a better you, not an end in themselves. Happiness is not about achieving goals, it's the everyday consequence of being happy with who we are and what we attempt to achieve.  
6. Clearly define your Values, when hard times come you'll need deeply rooted values to endure.
