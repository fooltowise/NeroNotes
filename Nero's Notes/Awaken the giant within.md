- The difference in the results that people produce comes down to what thez've done differently from others in the same situation. **Different actions produce different results.** Why? Because any action is a cause set in motion, and its effect builds on past effects to move us in a definite direction. Every direction leads to an ultimate destination: our destiny. In essence, if we want to direct our lives, we must take control of our consistent actions. **It's not what we do once in a while that shapes our lives, but what we do consistently. **
- Was Rosa Parks thinking of the future when she refused to give up her seat in that bus? Did she have a divine plan for how she could change the structure of the society? Perhaps. But what is more likely is that her decision to hold herself to a higher standard compelled her to act.
- What's important is not initially to know how you're going to create a result.  What's important is to know that **you will find a way**, no matter what. The elementary process for getting where you want to go is:
1. Decide what you want,
2. Take action
3. Notice what's working or not
4. Change your approach until you achieve what you want.

Deciding to produce a result causes events to be set in motion.

The three decisions that control your destiny are:
1. Your decision about **what to focus on.**
2. Your decision about **what things mean to you.**
3. Your decision about **what to do to create the results you desire.**

Success is the result of making small decisions: deciding to hold yourself to a higher standard, deciding to contribute, deciding to feed your mind rather than letting your environment to control you - these small decisions create the life experience we call success.
