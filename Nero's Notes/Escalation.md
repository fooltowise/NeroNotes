## Description:

When the state of a stock is determined by trying to surpass the state of another one - and vice versa- a reinforcing loop is created, carrying the system in an arms race, a wealth race, a smear campaign, a violence escalation. The escalation is exponential and can lead to extremes surprisingly quickly. If nothing is done, the spiral will stop when one of the actors collapses, because exponential growth cannot carry on indefinitely.

## Solution:

The best solution to get out of this trap is to never go in. If one is trapped in an escalation system, one can refuse competition (by disarming unilaterally), which interrupts the reinforcing loop. One can negotiate as well a new system with balancing loops to control escalation.
