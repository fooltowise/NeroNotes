# Convenience Benefits
Simply making a product readily accessible is an easy way to provide a clear benefit to customers. This can be best thought of as a convenience benefit. In its most basic form, consider neighborhood grocery stores and restaurants. They may not offer the cheapest or tastiest food, but neighbors pay for proximity. A benefit based solely on geography, however, is vulnerable to competition, as it does nothing to prevent new rivals from moving in nearby. likewise, there is an advantage to being the sole state or regional product distributor, but it too may be transient as the value proposition remains based on a forced choice by the customer.

A variation on the convenience theme is customer intimacy. This refers to sales models that position companies to best serve customer needs by offering convenience and efficiency. The principal source of customer intimacy is a direct relationship with existing customers - incumbency. A strong sales force can provide such a benefit, which is especially valuable  for complex products  where the salesperson assumes the role of the advisor. Intertwining products with personal affairs also helps, as when bank customers adopt automatic payroll deposits and bill payments or when telecommunications customers bundle cable, internet, and phone products.
