# Innovation Culture

[[Innovation dominance]] can facilitate both volume growth and pricing power. Even relatively simple developments in product design or unit size can valuable. The same product offered in smaller packages can expand occasions of use (such as "travel size") and potentially increase use by new or existing customers. Brand expansion into new categories can capture the benefits customers associate with the brand in new ways.

A culture of innovation dominance is attractive, particularly one that regularly renders new products. It is usually easier for companies to command higher prices and margins on new products versus old ones. When existing customers switch from the old to the new, the result tends to be a more attractive price mix. new products can also attract new customers, driving volume growth as well.

Innovation must be profitable to make innovation dominance attractive. Not all innovation makes a business better. **In many industries, companies must innovate constantly simply to defend their positions.** (see [[Evolution - Adaptation and the Red Queen Effect]]). When such innovation comes alongside declining margins (as R&D expenses are note covered by incremental sales), a company is engaged in costly cannibalization, not value creation.

To create value, innovation must increase volume or induce customer switching from a company's less-profitable to more-profitable offerings. In consumer goods, the most common way to achieve such switching is the trade-up to a more expensive version of an existing product. The path to "premiumization" is often smoothest for products associated with social status or those conferring health advantages, where a higher price is often perceived to yield a greater benefit. 

In markets where consumers are more cost-conscious, or products are defined primarily by taste benefits, volume gains are often a better target for innovation. In our experience, products with clearly defined stand-alone taste benefits are harder to ''trade-up" because of inculcation: consumers used to the taste of a certain cereal, soft drunk or candy bar are unlikely to be persuaded of the merits of a new and improved version. Why, after all, is there no premium brand of Corn Flakes, Kit-Kat or Coca-Cola? Rather, for many food categories, innovation is focused on packaging or completely new flavors, both aimed at volume gains. 

For corporate consumers, benefits from innovation need to be more tangible, such as appliances that slash energy costs. Since corporate buyers are often risk averse, incremental improvements are usually easier to sell than revolutionary innovations tat require big changes to how the business operates or which create new, unknown risks. 

Assuming customer appetite exists, the next question is how sustainable innovation can be. Difficulties may arise because advances have already been maximized - such as with basic calculators - or where there was a finite limit in the first place; there is only so much you can do with a cereal box. 

The track record of category  innovation can be a good guide to the future. Categories that have not made significant advances during the past five years are less likely to produce sustained and valuable innovation in the future than those who have made substantial progress during that time. In addition, superior prospects for innovation tend to occur in categories which have (at least perceived) significant scientific components, such as the personal care sector. Brands with records of successful innovation in a given category are likely to be capable of adaptive innovation in new categories - take, for example, Reckitt Benckiser's or Colgate's strong track records of innovating in apparently humdrum sectors from toothpaste to household cleaning products to cold remedies or foot care.
