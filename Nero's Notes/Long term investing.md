In *The Intelligent Investor*, Benjamin Graham provides a quick-and-dirty method for identifying excesses in the market: the number of IPO’s. Turns out, a large number of IPO’s typically precede market underperformance relative to the historical average. Of course, this need not imply causation: companies typically will IPO when the market is willing to except a lower yield, that is, a higher multiple, and this behavior produces excesses in itself. Thus, the record number of IPO’s that we have seen in 2019 is nothing new; what is new is the *nature* of these IPO’s. Companies are taking full advantage of a new phenomenon: equity subsidization.



Fast growing companies with no near-term prospect of profitability subsidize their operations through equity offerings. Even more confusing, investors are willing to subsidize money-losing ventures for a remote possibility of repayment at some point in the future. If no bank is willing to lend money to the newest tech firm, why are investors emptying their wallets for these offerings? Of course, the other rationale is that Silicon Valley has duped the investment community with adjusted earnings figures. Uber claims its ridesharing business is profitable, AWS is rumored to have 25% operating margins and, how could one forget, WeWork’s model is scalable.

It is important to remember, however, that the notion of rewarding companies for technological disruption with high valuations is a relatively new phenomenon. During the 20th century, the average corporate dividend yield was over 5% and reinvestment rates were a mere 50%. Moreover, the strategy of funding *ventures* rather than *companies* has never produced long-term market-beating returns save for the last decade. **When all is said and done, companies will be rewarded for their cash-producing ability from now until Judgement Day, and it is this ability that we ought to be vigilant seeking.  **



How do we find these gems? More specifically, how do we distinguish gold from pyrite? In my years studying investing, here are two observations I’ve made:



1. The vast majority of analysts will use 5-year or 10-year DCF models to value a company and pay painstaking attention to the assumptions to drive their interim period cash flows. To the dismay of many business school professors, this is unfortunately more often a waste of time. Here is the contribution of the terminal value to the appraised value of the firm given different interim growth rates in a 10-year DCF model:



| Projection Period Growth Rate |    Terminal Value Contribution |
| ----------------------------- | ----  --------------------------- |
| 5%                                 | 73%                         |
| 10%                                | 78%                         |
| 15%                                | 82%                         |
| 20%                                | 85%                         |
| 25%                                | 87%                         |
| 30%                                | 89%                         |



**What is 11-27% in a DCF model? A margin of error.** You can get the next 10 years of projections wrong- as long as you know what the company will look like 20 years from now. While this result does make me lament the endless hours countless business school students spend tweaking complicated Excel models, it does provide opportunity: a more qualitative method of investing. 

**Instead of throwing darts at FY2023 earnings, let us instead answer the question: will this company be around when I die?** If the answer is yes, you can be fairly certain that this “terminal value contribution” will be realized even if you are wrong on the direction of macroeconomics or industry for the next few years. The issue here is that this latter approach is far more difficult and requires an inordinate amount of foresight. Perhaps this is why most people avoid it. The FAANG world that dominates the S&P is an extremely recent phenomenon: each of these component companies were founded in the 1990’s. In 1930, The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company took in 10 cents for every dollar Americans spend on groceries every year; today the name doesn’t ring a bell. General Electric was a powerhouse under Jack Welch; the company began to languish seemingly just as Jeff Immelt was appointed to the helm as CEO. IBM invented the computer; now it has even lost the confidence of the most long-term oriented investor in our community, Warren Buffett. Some of us, including myself, may never acquire this foresight (in which case, it might be time to polish my resume and look for another career path). However, this extremely qualitative long-term view of a company is overlooked in the quantitative world of finance; it nonetheless remains a framework that every successful investor ought to spend his/her time thinking about.

1. Here is a mathematical certainty: if a company can earns an *X* percent annual return on invested capital, your return through investing in the company will be *X* percent per annum over a long period of time. Here’s the hard part: what will be the company’s average return on invested capital for a multi-decade period? Fortunately, the short-term nature of Wall Street has made this problem palatable. Again, people use 5-year or 10-year DCF models where they model in high growth rates and high rates of return. At the end of the “projection period”, they will plug in a perpetual 2% growth rate to the then “boring” company. What if a company can compound capital at a higher rate than its competitors for longer than that? **A junior analyst will get laughed out of the room for creating a 20 or 30-year DCF, so again, unfortunate situation for the junior analyst but an opportunity for investors.**



Armed with the knowledge that the vast majority of publicly traded companies are assumed to enjoy a period of above average returns of either 5 or 10 years, we can look for our gems: companies that can earn these above average returns on invested capital for a longer period. History is rife with examples. Coca-Cola famously achieved an average ROIC of 20% from 1960-1980; regardless of when you bought the stock in 1960, your return would have been 20% plus or minus some basis points. Tractor Supply Company, one of the best performing stocks of the past three decades, has achieved a 35% annual return for the past 20 years with an average ROE of 40%. Facebook and Google both have ROIC’s above 100%, that is, they need virtually no equity capital to grow, and returns have been stellar since their respective IPO’s.


**So, what is the recipe for a successful investment? A company that can earn above-average rates of return for an extremely long period of time that will be around when you die.** Alas, the answer to this query is not easy, perhaps impossible. However, it is the only query we should focus on when making investment decisions. These companies don’t present themselves often; just look at the turnover of the S&P over the past 50 years. Personally, if I find more than one of these companies every year, I’m doing something wrong. If an investor identifies these companies correctly only 3-4 times over the course of his/her career, then he/she should consider himself/herself extremely lucky. And if you do find one of these gems, the next part is easy: hold on for dear life.
