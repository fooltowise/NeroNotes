# Magic Ingredients
Another area where toll road patterns appear concerns Magic Ingredients. These are inputs bearing low cost but high value in production processes. Magic ingredients manifest in many settings. In the food and beverage industries, take enzymes, flavors and fragrances. For yogurt makers, starter cultures and flavor additives represent a small fraction of total cost. But they can have a material impact on the taste and texture of the final yogurt, which ultimately determine sales.

In industrial processes, gases have a similar roles: the cost of oxygen used in steel mills is trifling but if supply is disrupted, production ceases. So companies tend to pay up for oxygen, preferring to buy only from the few big reputable companies that dominate this toll road.
