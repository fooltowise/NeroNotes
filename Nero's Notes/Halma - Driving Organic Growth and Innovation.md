### Can you give us an introduction to how you first joined Halma?

I joined the Halma Future Leader Graduate Scheme after graduating and rotated through four different Halma opcos before working for the central innovation team, after which I joined one of the opcos for two years.

### Which companies did you rotate through?

I first worked at Avire, who make lift safety equipment like door sensors and emergency telephones. I was in the R&D team who were checking the feasibility of connecting our products to the cloud. I reported to R&D but also worked with the marketing team and that was my first project. I then worked at Keeler, who make ophthalmic instruments in Halma's medical sector. I was in the product team looking at how to get customer feedback in the most efficient way and how to react to that so we do not subjectively jump if one customer said something. There was a lot of process analysis to react quicker to warranty complaints.

My third rotation was at Ocean Optics in Halma's environmental sector. I was in the logistics team doing logistics and finance and analyzing the efficiency of shipping processes. That resulted in a reduced shipping damages and cost reduction with some interesting insights. My last placement was at Apollo, where I led a team of manufacturing engineers to look at a new process for calibrating smoke detectors. They wanted to automate that process and I was there for six months to prove the feasibility. We tested several and are now running the delta version in production.

### How would you compare those four operating companies?

They are quite different, even though they all are opcos. Halma doesn't ever change the culture, centralize processes or exchange the leadership team. Instead, they let them operate with autonomy, which means many differences. Avire is split across countries and is mid-sized in terms of Halma businesses, with a turnover of 30 million. It felt more intimate in how people interact which also relates to how fast they innovate. The whole team sits together in the office and bounces ideas off each other more. Keeler is a similar size but has a very different culture. It is in the medical industry which is much more regulated. That means you have to ensure you back up every single process and don't make any mistakes which could prove deadly. In the case of eye surgery, someone could lose their eye sight. Therefore, you need a slightly more rigid process. It was also different because they had no international interaction and their factory was on site, whereas the Avire factory is in the Czech Republic, so the team working there has very different skills.

At Keeler you can meet with the on-site manufacturing staff which is a very different interaction. Culture in the context of innovation is important to understand, they are set like that and don't necessarily change. Keeler has a traditional workforce who live nearby and have manufactured there for years and have immense pride in what they do. Avire has a local dynamic team who come together because they haven't worked that long for Avire yet. Having manufacturing elsewhere makes for a different innovation spirit. Ocean Optics is headquartered in the US whose culture is experimental and you cannot map that across continents.

I had different responses to similar analysis of how to get customer feedback at Keeler and the shipping analysis at Ocean Optics, which always came out with, here's a proposal of how we can improve it. Ocean Optics respond during the call, let's do it, what do you need now, can I call up my supplier and make the change to the box size. Whereas Keeler had to think about it. Size wise, they are all almost the same with the exception of Apollo who are very large and that was my last placement. They have the biggest turnover at Halma and are well-known in the fire industry. To make any change would affect a thousand installers so it is very different to even to make a change. Also it is in the fire industry and the size of the organization has a more hierarchical structure. The feeling you get at Avire is that people come together and create something, which would not happen as easily at Apollo because you need to involve many people.

### Of those four companies, how many of the original management teams are still running the company?

At Keeler, the original management team was still there. Because Avire consisted of four different companies which Halma bought and fused, that was no longer the case. Ocean Optics also had quite a switch over and the same at Apollo. By the time I joined, those companies had already been with Halma for several years, so originally the management team was there but they had switched over. I think at Keeler they were there the longest.

### Halma merge their opcos together to make a bigger business or brand; how does that influence the culture, innovation and efficiency of the company?

There are positives and negatives. Merging always means effort and alignment are required, and thinking around what does our brand now look like. People were attached to what they were called before and now have to think about the fact that they are called something different. That always stirs the waves, so part of people's energy goes towards how do we make that work? Is it my process or yours and will it stick? On the other hand, by doing this they realize the change was not dangerous, so perhaps another change will also not be as dangerous.

When I was there, I noticed their reason for being so open was because they don't know each other's products. Quite often you find a company who knows their space and exactly what will happen to their products so why are you telling me something else. Whereas at that company, I often bridged the gap between different teams. Part of the company is in Singapore and the other in the UK, so those different locations give an excuse to come up with different ideas.

### How did you join Halma's digital team?

After completing the Halma Future Leader Program, we have a conversation with the central team to understand which company culture we liked most to see which fits us best and where we can bring the biggest value. At that time, it was clear to me I enjoyed two things. One was collaborating across different Halma companies and bringing people together, and the other was the new technology I explored at Avire of how to connect products to the cloud. They had recently established an innovation and digital team and I was the perfect first team member as a digital product project manager, which was exactly what I wanted to do.

### How is that team structured?

It started with the Chief Innovation and Digital Officer being part of the executive board, reporting directly to Andrew the CEO. I was the first official team member but people were added over time. First some external experts who had done similar things in the past and might have helped digital startups or understood opportunities. More team members were added as we understood what companies needed. It started by stock taking to understand what was required, which is a very Halma way of doing it, instead of offering a guideline of how to do it. We understood where our companies were at, where they were stuck, and what we could do to help.

### Does Inken, the Innovation Officer, report to Andrew?

Yes.

### Did you and the others who were working with the opcos report to her?

Yes, and over time that also changed. In the beginning, I reported to Inken who reported to Andrew, but as more experienced people were added, I had a manager who led a certain growth engine.

### When working with Avire and moving their products to the cloud, what was the process of the innovation team?

It evolved and got much more structured. It starts out with understanding if there is even an opportunity. We wouldn't randomly work with Avire because we thought it was good. Avire could approach us with an opportunity or new business model which we think there is something to it, but we don't know how to best explore and validate it. Someone at Halma could recommend them as an interesting business for us to work with. The first step would always be to understand where they are at and what they have already done. The next step is to help them with the framework of design sprints, to quickly validate ideas with customers and get a proof of concept with an idea of the cost of it.

All along Lean Canvas is used in innovation but we simply guide them through that, often going to the site to do it with them, ensuring a cross-functional team is involved. After several weeks of being there on the other side, answering questions as they are going through that, we support them to put a deck together which they can present to their own board who can decide whether it is a valuable opportunity or not.

### What were the major challenges you faced when trying to bring innovation at an opco, such as Avire?

Change is always difficult for people but it depends how long they've been with the company as well as their role. Sometimes people see the product or company as their baby, which makes it hard to get them on board to look at it from a different lens. The outside world changes so that happens if you've worked somewhere for 20 years, but it is no longer the same as it was 20 years ago, so bringing that across is challenging. The second element is that everybody has their day job so when you put in an extra long-term project which is strategically relevant, they allow somebody who has a day job to also do this other thing, so time was always a challenge. We didn't want to overwhelm these teams because nobody gave them a break from their day-to-day job. The human element of being open to change and do things differently, and getting the time to do that, were the two main challenges.

### At Avire, were you moving from on premise managed accounts to cloud, or were you trying to roll out a new program?

Many of the Halma operating companies are in industries which are slowly moving towards or experimenting with what happens if you connect my product to the cloud. What data could they extract or what could they actually do. Many companies make sensors like Avire do with their door sensor, and those companies wonder what additional value they could provide their customers if they performed some analysis. Could they have different signaling or intelligence if their machine analyzed online? Could they give their customers a maintenance reporting tool or predictive maintenance?

Most of the Halma companies, by the nature of their product, were asking themselves what they could do if that happened. At Avire, it was very similar and other manufacturers were connecting it up. Whether they made money or not is another question, but there was definitely a trend of people promoting that there is a connection which you can access online and possibly make life simpler for the installers of many of those devices if they can configure them online. Avire wanted to explore what would happen if they did it and if it was even feasible because some of their technology was old and if they did it, who would buy it? It was a very open exploration.

### What was the outcome?

They did a feasibility study to answer that question and the second step was to do a proper piece of market research. Another Halma Future Leader after me spoke to both users and customers and I believe they eventually did it. If you go on the Avire website, they have a connected lift solution. There is some of the analysis so they eventually did it, but it took time to understand if it was feasible and more market research that happened after my time.

### Halma's report shows that 40% of their revenue is classified as digital products or services, which they include digital connected devices, IoT solutions or software and services. What is an example of the type of digital connected device? Would it be Avire connected sensors?

You hit on something which is hard to define. You can ask yourself the question, if you have a cable into something, is that digitally connected? It is tricky because you are trying to understand how ready your technology is to be able to extract data from it. If you have a device with an Ethernet port on it for example, like smoke detection panels at Advanced, that would count because it's easy to extract data from there, so the definition is whether a product has something already to easily extract data.

### That is not recurring revenue because they sell the alarm as a device?

This definition changes regularly and I do not know what definition they used in the most recent annual report. There are elements of Halma companies which have recurring revenue, and that percentage is indeed going up so their approach is working. Whether they now count this Ethernet enabled fire panel towards that 40%, I cannot tell you for sure.

### If you had to estimate, what percentage of Halma's total revenue is recurring? 5%, 10% or 20%?

All I can tell is that it is increasing, probably by a small percent as you say. I don't think it will account for half the revenue due to the nature of the company, but Halma have acquired more digital businesses which are inherently software subscriptions. There are several medical companies which are purely subscription based, so it wouldn't surprise me if that has reached double digits, but I don't know if it's at 40% yet.

### What are the risks to Avire continuing innovating to stay on top of industry?

There is a big shift for a company who sells hardware to software subscriptions. If we are continuing to innovate and going more towards being a SaaS business, then you start to have all the challenges of a startup business, especially the sudden speed of support required for your customers to deal with bugs versus realizing after or during installation. That is a very different approach to how fast your competitors move because software on the cloud is not regulated in the same way, so competitors can do similar things and move much faster. I know that now because I am in a fast business and the speed at which your competitors catch up with you is way faster.

### What was the original purpose of launching an innovation team at Halma?

It was a great foresight of Andrew the CEO, who realized we had to do something to help Halma businesses over time.

### Halma buys high quality engineering businesses that are regulated which is an advantage, but when you sell hardware or mechanical products every few years, you don't have to be close to the customer to understand how they're changing, so it puts you at a larger risk of not being close to industry changes, versus the software business which has a daily customer frequency. The higher the frequency, the quicker the industry moves, so there is more competitive risk and it's about balancing the two?

SaaS businesses have a customer lifetime value of how long they stay with you. If you think of that in hardware terms, the industries Halma is in have high customer lifetime value and low churn, because they install something that will stay in the building. I am giving the infrastructure example but they make a system decision once, then it stays in the building until it gets ripped out after 10 or 20 years. Until then, each time you add another room, you need another detector, so you have a continuous process of it not going away. It is similar to operating systems from Apple and Windows, you like an operating system and stick with it; you have somebody who is super loyal and over time will continue buying that thing. In that sense, they are well protected which is different to a software business which is easier to switch to other software. Halma companies are also built into the infrastructure.

### What is the main disruption risk for Halma's infrastructure businesses like Avire, Advanced or Apollo?

It is difficult to estimate how fast things move but they will clearly not stay the same. Everybody has Google Nest at home so they are starting to see things differently. If you think about the physical event of a fire and the destruction it can bring, it is clear that a small not so rugged device on the ceiling might not be the best versus a metal box from Advanced on the wall in commercial buildings which is very robust and the cables can withstand fire. There is a physical element that is difficult to disrupt unless you are clever in how you do it. There is a technical feasibility element which prevents that from happening, and there are also regulations, so big institutions would have to change. It's possible because the FDA introduced something several years ago to fast track digital medical devices and software. Fire regulators like the BEA do all the testing so they would have to change, but it's very unlikely they will change quickly, unless there a big generation turnover in several years.

### If you think about your time with Andrew and Inken, which part of the business was potentially more at risk of disruption than others?

Clearly, the medical companies but on the other hand, they saw the opportunity. This team was never scared of telling Halma companies they had a task otherwise their business would cease to exist. It was more like, do you want to grow more than you currently do because you're quite limited if you already have penetration in your market. If you look at the exponential growth you can get with a SaaS business, why wouldn't you try it.

From a disruption risk, the medical industry is always moving the fastest. Apple have officially become a health company and they have enough cash to do whatever they want. Blood pressure measurements and others will be more difficult, but by collaborating and thinking through this to establishing different business models with your loyal customer base, you can do something. There are businesses which offer outcome-based pricing on building maintenance or certain sensors. There are so many business models that give you such a huge return compared to your actual device sale you just made, and seeing those startups in other areas, we were missing an opportunity in all sectors, so that was even more of a driver.

### Halma have an accelerator and are doing more venture type investment as well in small size. It seems Andrew is trying to allocate capital to invest in software or service type businesses, which is completely different to Apollo 20 or 30 years ago, and it adds a different level of risk into the business.

100%.

### How do Halma foster knowledge transfer across their diverse companies?

It is always in the forefront and I am one example. Halma Future Leaders jump between companies and have their own network between cohorts of 15 people every year. We know the people above and below us, and we make many links. If somebody has a project and they don't know where to start, someone else knows someone from an operating company and will arrange for them to speak to your team. I did that multiple times, where I had someone from a Halma company visit and they helped explain.

Halma also opens up opportunities internally for the whole of Halma. If a software engineer at Apollo wanted to move to project or product management and there was an opportunity at another Halma company, if he moved there, he would automatically bring elements that company lacked. You often see them at director level switching from one company to another. A third element is their intranet knowledge sharing platform where people share videos, articles and success stories. The fourth element is their company-wide gatherings.

### In the Avire example, you were trying to move to the cloud to do predictive maintenance, or to try and drive organic growth and reduce disruption risks. How transferable is that to Apollo or a medical company? Obviously, they are very different businesses, customers and end markets, but how transferable is that learning of driving innovation and new products?

It is very transferable and I do it myself with very similar processes. It always comes back to what the user needs and what problems you are trying to solve. From there, you ideate and find solutions to that, and that process works regardless of industry. If you acquire the experience by doing it once and know which tools to use and how to lead a team or bring people together, you can take that to any other company. The people who have seen it work, find it fascinating and they might bring elements to it. A director who saw a team do it could go to a different company and dedicate a team to do the same, or get the person in touch with the central Halma team who runs them through one of those sprints.

### Is it more of a mindset than a culture that encourages opcos to behave in a certain way?

Exactly.

### Can you share some context into how you ended up at Advanced?

It was from a personal growth perspective. I was at that central team for two years and I understood a lot about the processes and how to run innovations. When you are in the central team, you help the teams but never fully get a chance to own anything. You still follow up with them but not for half a year or more. It was the action orientated hands-on approach that I wanted.

I knew the operating companies and where the opportunities were and was always fascinated with the fire industry and what Advanced do with fire detection panels. They are a metal box on the wall with a little computer inside. They are a software business and many of their engineers are software engineers, but instead of software in the cloud, it is software on the wall. It gathers a lot of data and there are so many opportunities around what you could do with that data. I liked the whole application and the culture. They are in the north of the UK which has a different approach to innovation than the south.

It also gave me a good opportunity because the leadership team there are strategically relevant. They wanted a full-time person dedicated to this and were willing to give them a team, which not all Halma companies do. There was a perfect opportunity and so I joined them. I took an initial idea all the way from the opportunity research – as in is there an opportunity and how much will it cost our customers and can we eventually charge – all the way to what it looks like in building and piloting it. I then built out my own team.

### What was the idea?

Those fire detection panels on the wall are made for engineers who install and maintain it. A facility team manages that fire panel in a bank or a factory, and any time the fire alarm goes off, they go to that panel to understand where it went off and to check if there was a fire or not, then they can stop it.

### They are not the installers?

Yes, they are the facility team, and the big problem they have is that this is such a technically designed element with many LEDs which report device 001 in zone 10 might be at fault, which is difficult for a facility team to understand. The new system from Advanced allows the facility team to interact more easily with the fire panel. It is a mobile interface which you can access on your mobile or desktop. It shows the building layout and where it went off. It makes the reaction to a fire alarm much faster so it's invaluable.

### Is Advanced business model straight hardware sales or is there recurring revenue?

The whole purpose of this was to change it to a recurring revenue model.

### You sell the device to the building owner then provide the data to the facility team managers who pay for the software on a recurring revenue model?

Yes; the facility would pay what we call the end user, after it was installed.

### What was the biggest difference when you worked at Advanced and Apollo?

The bigger the company, the slower it gets, which is clearly the case at Apollo and Advanced. The speed at which you can innovate or ideate and put something into action is different because Apollo has many approval layers. An employee can make a bigger impact faster at Advanced than they can at Apollo.

### How does the central team work with the opco? Take Advanced for example, where you were looking to roll out this new product which had recurring revenue but also gives a better experience to facility managers. How involved is Inken and that central innovation team, or Andrew and his team with initiatives like this?

There was a reporting back channel because we wanted to keep them in the loop, and we also asked for advice. I would ask the central Halma team to teach us how to do different sales processes. The opco would reach out to the Halma team for help because we did it for so many companies. There were also quarterly updates covering any barriers so that they also had a picture.

### Would Inken and team do that with the sector team or a divisional CEO?

Both of them were called; a representative from Inken's team and from the sector.

### How does the org structure work? My understanding is that you have a sector CEO like Paul Simmons who ran infrastructure for some time, then there would be a divisional CEO for a group of companies, but how does it work between those layers of management?

MDs report to their divisional chief executives who oversee several companies, which they visit and sit on their boards. We regularly had a DCE sit in on meetings and give a perspective of what else was happening in the sector. It was interesting because you understood whether other companies were struggling. Sometimes it was like, you guys should work together because you are doing something similar. DCEs would highlight opportunities and ensure the companies had some Halma strategy input, which mainly came from them.

The team would then bundle that together because the sector CEO doesn't have the capacity to do that, but he would represent that particular sector on the executive board. Infrastructure and process safety are different business, as are medical and environmental, so having those two perspectives alongside the functional representatives in the executive board was helpful. One is an executive board function and the other is a strategic input function.

### Is there an Advanced CEO who reports to the divisional?

There is an Advanced MD and each operating company has their own board of directors and senior leadership team. I was part of that senior leadership team, reporting directly to the MD at Advanced, who reports to the DCE, alongside other MDs. Those DCEs report into the sector CEO, who reports to Andrew.

### How effective is that structure?

I always took it as a given and never thought about how you would optimize it. They changed it over time because it used to be four sectors and they condensed it into two. It is good to have both a Halma and an external perspective in those board meetings. You probably couldn't do this without several DCEs. You also cannot have all of these DCEs reporting to the CEO, so you have to have a layer in between. It makes logical sense why it is set up that way, and I assume as the companies grow, that model scales better, because you can simply add another DCE to handle several companies.

### How well do the DCEs know the companies?

They were sometimes MDs themselves because of the progression. The next step after MD is DCE, so they come from a background where they have run a Halma business and know all the procedures and processes. That eliminates some of the learning curve in terms of the industry. They gain the trust of the MDs because they know how the businesses are run. Sometimes they know the industry, but if they don't, that brings an interesting perspective. There is always a reason they are in that position; usually they were strong in something. Some of them are good marketeers and might have come through that way to become MD, and others are financial experts and become a thought partner to the MD. It is healthy to be outside and not know all the ins and out and be able to go from the balcony level.

### What do the MDs of opcos think about DCEs and the structure they're in, given that they used to run their own business and own their destiny?

It depends whether the MD is the original MD or new. The new ones have a good relationship with the DCEs because they are their ally. They might know other MDs but the DCE is their direct line manager and can help the, through many challenges. So they have a really good relation with the people who are basically like traditional MDs. Halma doesn't have that attitude of buying a company and changing everything; it is usually more of an advisory role and helping them get their financial forms in the right order. In that moment, the DCE can be a good friend, rather than a central enemy, but it's mostly positive.

### Did the MDs of Advanced and Apollo often communicate with each other?

Yes, but it depends on the sector. They are non-executive board members for each other. At Advanced, the MD of another Halma business in gas detection gave his perspective, so you automatically get that anyway. Because of the network these people build, if you enter Halma there's usually a lot of movement inside Halma, so the current MD might have been the director at another company, when his colleague is now also an MD, so there is that network where they speak with each other. MDs also meet each other frequently at exclusive company-wide gatherings, where they exchange information.

When I look at Halma and other similar companies, there is a risk of losing experienced people. For example, if you purchase Advanced, the founders who sell out might stay for a year or two, but will eventually leave. They are great companies with low technological risk, but then they become part of Halma's process and report to a divisional CEO, who may not even know the company. How do you look at that risk of over time? Divisional CEOs might not know the companies as well as the old owners, which could put more risk onto the businesses of being disrupted or not being close to the evolution in the industry. That's obviously what your whole team was for, but how do you see that risk evolving over time?

I don't think our team was there to even out that personal change problem of suddenly losing somebody really experienced. It is good when that happens because then a company reevaluates their strategy of where they should focus most, which is sometimes different to what the person's preconceived ideas were beforehand. A founder of a business would have spoken to their customers 10 or 20 years ago. It is also an opportunity but some knowledge is lost. The usually don't leave on bad terms; sometimes they go into retirement. The former MD of Advanced often used to come back to give some ideas and thoughts and enjoyed being involved, despite retiring.

### Halma consists of very mature businesses that are structurally advantaged; what is the biggest risk for those companies?

There is a risk of change which happens when a generation turns over. Some of the engineers have been there for 10 or 20 years and have so much knowledge and know how this business and industry operates. When they leave, you lose a lot of knowledge, but your industry might completely change. In 10 years, all the installers in the fire industry will have retired. Maybe their sons and daughters take over their installation business, but they have a very different attitude to technology. That won't be threatened by the cloud but they might be more open to regulatory changes. The biggest risk in some of these industries is the pure generation change and what that does to your business. I don't know how you build up capacity for that other than having Halma Future Leaders and younger talent already in it.

### Andrew has this on his radar with the innovation team and hiring.

I think so, yes.

### He's paying attention to it.

100% he is, yes.
