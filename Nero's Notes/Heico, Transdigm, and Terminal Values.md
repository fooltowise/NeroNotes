### One of the first questions I had was, how did you choose to invest in one or the other share classes?

Analyst 1: For me, it was just a matter of trusting the Mendelsons and being content with the A shares, even though they don’t vote as much. When I bought them, they were significantly cheaper. To me, it didn’t make any sense to pay up for more voting rights.

Analyst 2: Voting rights is something that directed me to go towards the regulars, as opposed to A. We own both; more regular than A. As you may know, A got created as a result of a failed acquisition and they have never been able to go back to collapsing the two, primarily for tax reasons. That is the same reason why I don’t invest in any ADRs or GDRs; I want to be able to own the equity and own the voting rights.

### So you own mainly the voting shares?

Analyst 2: Yes.

### How much more expensive have they been, on average?

Analyst 2: The spread between common and A has been fairly steady, even today. What do you see as A?

Analyst 3: It’s roughly a 20% spread right now.

Analyst 2: Yes; it’s been fairly steady like that.

Analyst 3: Historically, the spread has been around 20%, 25% and then, during Covid, the spread collapsed and actually went negative. There was a really interesting arbitrage move where, essentially, sell all your As and buy all the traditional. Literally, by the end of the day, there was a 50% premium being reassigned to the As. From there, you could sell all of your voting stock and end up having a 15% larger position, less taxes, in your A. Historically, it was around 20%, 25%. Before Covid, it started collapsing closer to 10% and then it went negative and now it has re-expanded out.

The reason why it happened in Covid was, on that day, there was a fund that was blown out of position. The voting stock is more held by active managers. I have alerts set for the spread.

Analyst 2: Remind me again, does Greenhaven own [[HEICO]], or not yet?

Analyst 3: No. There is no economic difference between the two ships. Chipotle did this, back in the day. Back in 2008, 2009, they had two share classes but, essentially, economically, they were the same. Obviously, Berkshire split; it’s the same. Although there is an interesting arbitrage there because you can actually convert. You can’t do that with [[HEICO]], which would be really interesting.

In the end, I don’t think, personally, if I held a huge chunk of the voting class, I would change anything that they are doing.

### 20% just seems like a huge spread to me, especially with this company where the whole thesis is that you trust the management because they are allocating capital and they have got a track record. It doesn’t make intuitive sense for it to be such a big discount.

Analyst 3: It doesn’t make any sense. It is difficult to arb out. You can do it, with some companies, but there is no reason why that spread has to change. If you think, for the holders of the voting class, what is their cost basis and where would the premium have to go before they would be willing to sell those and buy the As? Again, if it was convertible, like Berkshire, you could arb that all day long and there is actually an interesting play you can do with Berkshire, with that, right now. It just takes a lot of capital.

I don’t know why it does it. I don’t think it’s rational for it to do it, because I don’t think holding those votes is really going to the change the outcome of the intrinsic value of the business, because it’s well run.

### It’s different if you want to have some kind of right. But the whole thesis around these companies is that you trust the family and the history.

Analyst 3: I think it ultimately corrects, later. This will go to the business and their ability to retain capital and compound it at high internal rates. If that ability starts diminishing, then they have a very attractive spot where they can deploy repurchases. Let’s say the voting class are the ones that are perfectly valued and the As aren’t; you’re immediately getting a 20%, 25% discount on the business. Right now, they can retain all the capital and compound it at higher rates of return.

Analyst 1: At some point down the road, if it swaps, maybe you will get a little windfall from the A shares? Who knows?

### It would obviously take the market recognizing that these shouldn’t be discounted as much as that spread suggests? But as you said, what is the reason that would happen?

Analyst 3: There are two, I think. Firstly, someone is going to be buying it and they could arb it. I don’t know what the borrower costs would be to short the non-As and go long on the As. There is not a lot of value there, in the options market. The other thing is if, at some point, they wanted to collapse it, they just amend the common stock to say it’s convertible, one for one, into HEI A. Or vice versa. They could collapse the share count that way. Since, I believe, that would be a non-taxable event, they could actually clear up the tax piece.

Analyst 2: I don’t know if that is true, though? I think it becomes a taxable event. Don’t ask me how and why.

Analyst 3: Converting on A share for Berkshire to 1,500 Bs isn’t taxable. I would assume – as long as it was a one for one – it shouldn’t be taxable.

Analyst 2: Maybe. I don’t know the answer, but I remember asking the CFO this question and, I believe, he said it’s because of tax reasons, why they haven’t collapsed it.

Analyst 1: Sometimes those tax reasons sunset after a while. It might be that they can’t do it for some number of years.

Analyst 2: This has been around for a long time.

Analyst 3: Ultimately, it doesn’t impact the overall business. If you think the stock could compound at 15 and they could buy that at a 25% discount, then maybe, over a five-year period, you get 18 or 19, annualized. I would much rather make sure they are acquiring businesses that are attractive, that they can integrate and find new customers.

### What originally got you attracted to [[HEICO]]?

Analyst 3: One of my mentors turned me onto the company. At Columbia, the Value Investing Program is very big into this type of companies; quality, compounders, capital allocation. I did a big deep dive into the company. I thought it was interesting that people call it the Berkshire Hathaway of aviation and it is, actually, a very apt comparison. Buffett went to Columbia and studied under Ben Graham; Mendelson went to Columbia three or four years later than Buffett and studied under David Dodd, so it’s an apt comparison.

I did the deep dive project on it and thought it was interesting. Obviously, when Covid came, I thought it was just stupidly cheap. I was actually mentoring one of the Mendelson’s sons; I didn’t even know it was him at first. I pitched [[HEICO]] and he said, I told my dad about it over the dinner table and he said, if you ever want to come down. I think it was Eric’s son. The Mendelsons have a very strong connection to Columbia. They’ve been going since 1906 or something like that.

That’s how I got into it. I think it’s very interesting. When you read their shareholder letters or their transcripts, I think the one that stood out to me was in 2008 or a little later. It was straight out of Competition Demystified by Greenwald, of how they set their pricing and what they want market share to be. They understand prisoner’s dilemma and how this works and they do it masterfully. What’s not to like, other than price, sometimes?

### Do you mean in terms of leaving part of the market to OEMs and understanding that dynamic between them? What do you mean by understanding and targeting market share?

Analyst 3: If your goal is only to take 15% of the market and you want to leave the remaining 85%, you are essentially doing that so, if there is any tit for tat, the OEM is going to be losing a lot more than you are. If you go back to the Cola wars, Pepsi comes into Coca-Cola’s territory and cuts prices. Maybe Pepsi loses a million bucks a year doing that, but if Coke matches their prices, they lose 100 million. If you do that in this marketplace, where maybe the OEMs try and price compete, [[HEICO]] might break even from what they are currently making, and the OEM is probably going to take half a billion-dollar loss, from what they were making, if they just say, I’ll accept 85% of the market and I will cede this other 15% to you. If they react, they’re cutting off their nose to spite their face.

It’s masterful competitive theory, the way that they perform it.

### Is that specifically the PMA part?

Analyst 3: Yes.

Analyst 3: You could then dive into some of the military aspects and the space piece. I was formerly an air force contracting officer, dealing with a lot of these space contracts and I know how profitable these contracts are to defense industries. Their returns on invested capital, for these projects, are usually insane. You’re talking 90% returns on invested capital, depending on the contract. If it’s cost reimbursement or cost plus fixed fee, you are getting paid every 30 days for your costs. Maybe there is a delay in payments, so maybe you are only 60 days of working capital. But for 60 days of working capital, you are getting paid a 10% fee on top of that.

If you think about the annual amount you are going to make on this project, but you are only going to have to use two months of invested capital, your return on invested capital here ends up being close to 90% plus, though it does vary. I don’t think the attractiveness of those contracts is going to go away.

### I know they have various different segments and when reading about it, I guess you don’t know, specifically, what is in each of those? From my understanding, I’ve seen numbers where the PMA parts are under 20% of actual revenue. Is that right? They do a bunch of other stuff, like repair and MRO.

Analyst 2: They don’t break it down between PMA and MRO. It’s just two segments; the ETG and the FSG.

### In the FSG, for example, they have aftermarket replacement parts, which is about 60% and then repair and overhaul parts and specialty products. The PMA part is only a portion of the revenue.

Analyst 3: New parts has very long runway, for the penetration. There is a lot that goes there and the returns on investment that they can get from that R&D spend – not even R&D spend if they already have the parts – as well as for customer penetration, so it’s more on your marketing and sales teams’ side. That is very low incremental investment to drive very high ultimate returns.

I always think about runway and altitude; a bit of a cliché given it’s an aviation company. How much runway does the company have to reinvest and what is the altitude, in terms of returns, on that? Obviously, the more altitude, the more runway you have and the greater the value. They have very long runway. It doesn’t have to be 30% returns here. If you have a long runway and 20% returns, grand slam.

### When you say runway, you mean adding PMAs every year, consistently, and keep pushing it through?

Analyst 3: Yes, added PMAs; that is partly R&D spend. Then you have new customers and also current customers. If your current customer base is only 10% of their parts, even though you have the actual parts for 30%, think about the organic growth from that. And a lot of that growth is free growth; you don’t have to pay for it. Maybe a little bit on your sales team, but maybe not. After Covid, companies are obviously looking at their cost structure and it makes sense to go from 10% to 30%. That’s free growth. How do you value that? What would you pay for a company that has 5% free growth?

### When you are modelling out revenue growth, organic growth, are you making an assumption on PMA penetration or number of new PMA parts per year, to back out that number? Plus, you are adding all the other segments they have. How do you look at that topline growth number, if you do at all?

Analyst 3: You do; we can’t just lick our finger, throw it up and see where it’s going. You can get the rough math. There’s a pretty good framework of what percentage of aircraft parts are not – I don’t want to say mission critical, because they are all mission critical – but if you lose the fan blade, you can lose the airplane. [[HEICO]], typically, doesn’t go into those parts.

### Basically, they are not going to go for all the LLP parts, which is a big chunk? From my numbers, I have 2% penetration for PMA total parts but, I would guess, 50% of those are probably not even addressable for [[HEICO]]?

Exactly. Figure out the big picture number of parts, whatever percentage is non-addressable, where are they at today? That gives you where they are at, currently. Then you can start figuring out, through their biggest customers, are they are 10%? Wallet share is not really the right word; maybe portfolio share. Of the portfolio, is it the same 50% that is non-addressable or is it 60% or is it 30%? You have to do it per customer. From there, you can see, on a per customer basis, where that extra growth can come from and then what is it going to cost you to get that. That is piece one; that is current business.

Then you have to start factoring in growth of the overall industry and then go to growth, in R&D, of new PMA parts. Does that expand what is addressable in the portfolio of a customer or does it just open up new customers? That is the way I would focus on it. Then you can figure out what margins should look like and what the operational leverage is and get to a ball park of what the IRR should be, looking ahead.

### What do you think of the limitations to increase that penetration?

Analyst 3: There are a few. Obviously, there’s relational. If you don’t have a foot in the door with a customer and they are tied to an OEM and OEMs obviously see the risk here and they want to build stronger barriers for [[HEICO]] to get in, that could be hard to get the new customers. I think, for the customers that they currently have, unless OEMs start giving more benefits or cutting price – which we already talked about from a competitive strategy standpoint – I think part of it is that there is an inevitability to it.

The biggest risk is if there is ever a major mishap, where a PMA part, even if it’s a fan blade – something that is not a [[HEICO]] part – and something that makes airlines say, it’s more expensive for us, psychologically, or from what we might have to pay out if we get sued – think about what’s going on with Boeing – because of a mishap, does that exceed what the benefits are for us by going PMA? That’s a big risk.

Analyst 1: The other limiting factor that comes to mind, on PMA, is the aircraft lessors. With the growth of increased leasing of aircraft, they are not going to use PMA parts. I think, overall, the opportunity is huge, because even the older planes don’t really go away. They become cargo jets and they still fly somewhere in the world and then they use PMA parts. When you factor that in, it seems to me, it’s a pretty huge tailwind.

Analyst 3: In terms of the aircraft lessors, actually, there might be a few less of them.

Analyst 1: Yes; that’s changing too. There are some aircraft lessors now that are allowing PMA parts.

### Really?

Analyst 1: In one of the interviews I did recently, they mentioned a smaller firm.

Analyst 2: CFM and Safran got together and they started this engagement with the EU, which forced them to accept these PMA parts on leased aircraft. Apart from what has already been said, this is less of an issue than acquisition and something going wrong with the way these guys grow, which can also be another factor.

### What kind of companies do they purchase? What is their acquisition strategy?

Analyst 2: It’s on both the FSG and ETG side. Think about a Lockheed Martin engineer who finds himself suffocating within Lockheed because of some red tape. Picks up a few of his engineer colleagues and starts a smaller operation that becomes interesting enough to [[HEICO]] and the other players, such as [[TransDigm]]. For whatever reason, they hit a glass ceiling and are not able to find capital or resources for their workmen.

### Only for PMA parts?

Analyst 2: PMA is an important focus, as far as the acquisition engine is concerned. But my concern is more about, even though they are very careful about making these acquisitions where they don’t acquire 100% all the time, and leave a chunk for the selling management team, the safety within those acquired businesses can, at some point, even if it is just one single thorn on their side, can be an issue. Just a couple of years ago, Tom Murphy passed away and he had an interesting comment about acquisitions. He said, in bad times, deals are bad for acquiring companies, two-thirds of the time. In good times, deals are bad for acquiring companies, three-quarters of the time.

There are various different ways of looking at acquisitions. I know one of the other guys here is a big fan of acquiring businesses but, I believe, it is also a potential issue for somebody like a [[HEICO]].

Analyst 1: For [[HEICO]], I think they have demonstrated they have skill in that area. Probably, the primary risk for the stock not working is that they screw up the capital allocation; that’s why we’re all in it. They’ve proven they are able to allocate capital at a very high rate, to keep a clean balance sheet.

### I know [[TransDigm]] is going to buy sole-source IP, that has a huge life in the aftermarket. [[HEICO]] have much more flexibility and the transaction structure can also be more flexible. I’m not actually sure they buy only PMA parts; I think they own some OEM stuff. Do you guys just trust they are going to allocate carefully?

Analyst 3: They do buy things on the defense side. My crystal ball is foggy here and I don’t know exactly what they are going to do tomorrow or the day after. But in terms of capital allocation, I think past performance and the way that they’ve thought and talked about it is probably more indicative of what the future will be. In my opinion, you have to give them some benefit of the doubt, if they have consistently focused on driving value creation per share, have focused on returns and not chasing returns.

Where I would say the difference is between a [[HEICO]] and a [[TransDigm]], goes back to Peter Kaufman’s concept of win-win; all the wins. If you are a customer of [[TransDigm]], for the most part, you are looking for the soonest opportunity to not be. From the government side, and seeing how it works at some other commercial places, yes, [[TransDigm]] has you. You have to buy the product.

### Do you know it was [[TransDigm]]? Was it the talk of the town?

Analyst 3: You know who it is. The Department of Defense knows who [[TransDigm]] is; just go and look at all the IG inspections. They go into a lot of these with eyes wide open.

I would say [[HEICO]], on the other hand, is much more about saying, I’m going to offer you parts and solutions that help your bottom line. We’re going to earn an appropriate rate of return, for the investments that we have. They are thinking a lot longer term about planting multiple fields, that they can sow at different times. Not planting every field and take the biggest machine, where I can mow everything down and be damned if nothing grows back again, because the customers hate me.

I think that is a much bigger risk for a [[TransDigm]], particularly when you add leverage into it. That is where I would say the difference between the two of them is. Obviously, there are risks in the acquisitions, in that valuations have come up. You used to be able to buy these for four to five times EBITDA, once they integrated it into the system. That’s not happening today and, obviously, that reduces the company’s value if a decent portion of cash flow – and that’s where some of the growth is coming from – is having to pay eight or nine times. Still good returns, overall, but not amazing returns, so it lowers value.

Analyst 2: In fact, in this quarter’s call, Lawrence was very particular about answering a question about 14 times, for an acquisition. Back to the point that you mentioned, if you go back and look at how the company has executed, how they have articulated their strategy, not wanting to take on too much debt – take on debt to be able to pay it off within 18 months or so – and not necessarily wanting to jack up the pricing on products, post-acquisition, at least the way that [[TransDigm]] does it. Owner-operated business, with all three of them wanting a big chunk, less debt, with a careful eye towards managing the margins.

Covid, obviously, impacted this business pretty meaningfully. The first thing [[HEICO]] management did – at least for the senior management team – was to put the compensation on freeze; no bonus, compensation on freeze. Eventually, they came out of it as the market opened up. You go to [[TransDigm]], look at the proxy, and it’s like a moving goalpost. First of all, Nick, the chairman who founded it, doesn’t own much. If you look at that proxy, in terms of the compensation program, they used to have a fairly complex computational approach to paying bonus and the cost of the overall business was in the doldrums. They said they wanted to be able to pay the management team.

They have this weird structure with making up for dividends and options and stuff like that. It’s a clear distinction between the two companies, in terms of the quality of the management team. Operational differences have already been mentioned but just going through the proxy will tell you more about the quality of the management team.

Analyst 1: I just want to throw in a counterpoint because I’ve done some interviews where people say the difference between a [[TransDigm]] and everyone else is a little bit overplayed. They will say stuff like, [[TransDigm]] has this bad reputation, but they all do the same stuff. They have a good point. I was saying to one guy that [[TransDigm]] was known for this price-gouging strategy to an extreme that, apparently, HECIO doesn’t have. He said to me, if that were true, then why do they continue to win new deals. He mentioned the new thing, that was a part on the wing of a 787. Instead of getting a new person to make it, they got [[TransDigm]] to do it. I just want to throw that in there as a possible counterpoint to the narrative that [[TransDigm]] and [[HEICO]] are so different operationally. Maybe they are; maybe they aren’t.

### How does [[HEICO]] change the prices, post-acquisition? I don’t think they buy similar companies?

Analyst 1: We were talking about that, at some point, there is a little bit of a trust story, in terms of looking at their past. It’s not really realistic. Even if you look at that ETG segment, it’s got microwave and data and this and that. You can’t underwrite what all those things are and what those companies are doing; it’s just a box. It’s not the Flight Support Group; it’s this group. You just have to go by their track record. Some of these things are harder to answer.

Analyst 3: On [[TransDigm]], pushing back on the 787 point, in terms of the part on that wing, I think a lot of this comes down to the frequency and cost of replacement. A [[HEICO]] is structured more to higher frequency replacement. The airlines have to do 15 per year and it’s meaningful for them and they can advertise the cost of development over all these parts.

If a [[HEICO]] has to come in and design, in terms of the upfront cost of R&D, to design this one part for a 787, but is only going to be replaced once or twice a year, then you have to start factoring in, how much is it going to cost me to design, the probability of winning the contract and then the price I’m going to be able to charge. Instead, what if I just spend that and get another 30 PMA parts?

There could be a reason. For example, for Glenair, that is a lot of what they focus on. Low replacement numbers, per year, but they are going to charge you a very high price. There are barriers to entry in that.

### Isn’t that [[TransDigm]]’s pushback? These are off-platform parts and, therefore, it’s costing me a fortune to manufacture them because I’m not doing a million of them, for the new plane. You are never going to find out exactly what the fair price is.

Analyst 3: Right. Somehow, I don’t think that the price of manufacturing a certain F16 part increased 400%, from pre-acquisition to day after. But maybe the other company would just say, we had a lower expectation of returns on our investments.

### They argue that they were underpricing that part because they were all earning all their margin on the systems.

Exactly.

### To keep the system business with the OEM.

Analyst 3: Yes; and there is an argument there. The other difference, I would say, in terms of management style, is that I had the opportunity to speak with Nick Howley, shortly after Covid and – I didn’t know this going into it – during Covid, [[TransDigm]] were going to have to raise a very expensive PIPE. If you look at [[HEICO]], they didn’t. They had the cash; they were good. They didn’t let a whole bunch of people go. They run their business in a way – maybe another apt comparison to a Berkshire – in that maybe the dominoes are going to fall, but they might be the last domino to fall. [[TransDigm]] would not have been.

[[TransDigm]] probably earns higher returns; you’re going to get a bigger return over the next few years. But again, if I go back to runway and altitude, [[TransDigm]] has very high altitude, but I don’t know how far their runway is. If you screw your customers too many times, even if they need the part, eventually they are going to try and find a way out of it. That just opens the door to competition.

If you’re taking [[HEICO]]’s approach to, how can we generate value across the stakeholders, and still earn an attractive, but not excessive, rate of return, you have a very long runway and runway is what matters.

### When you mentioned looking at the past, obviously, the track record matters. But how much do you trust that his sons have that philosophy and capability of allocating capital, like Lawrence? Because, actually, it’s his track record, not the son’s, if they’re going to take over?

Analyst 2: The way the family ended up with this company is, when Eric was going through his Columbia experience, he came across this business model. It was an existing company that they eventually took over, in the early 1990s. My point to your question is, both Eric and Victor have very clear demarcations of what they are responsible for, at this point; FSG and ETG. That was a question I had for the CFO. I haven’t met the team; typically, I would have gone down to meet them a couple of times. But because of Covid, I wanted to be careful and haven’t yet met the team.

But I did raise this question and, apparently, the three of them meet, fairly regularly, on a weekly basis. At least, on paper, there are very clear lines of responsibility for different segments and it is very clear as to how the business will be run, post Lawrence, the father, retiring and leaving the scene.

Analyst 3: I think that’s a great exercise to go through with any company. People don’t realize, in terms of [[HEICO]], the path dependency of this business and how, the Mendelsons – not just Larry; it has been a family affair, from day one – have taken that and adapted to a lot of the path dependencies that have happened.

If you go back and ply PMA parts, how did the PMA part even come about? You go back to the aircraft mishap in England and how that resulted in [[HEICO]] even being involved in creating the initial parts. Then saying, if we could do this one, why can’t we do our own? Following the lawsuit that was going on at [[HEICO]] and understanding that, I don’t even think that lawsuit got settled until 2001. Seeing the decisions that they made, not just Larry, but the family as a whole, and what they did, it was, essentially, a hostile takeover

They had to run a proxy to get the company. It’s not like a family-run business, where the patriarch or matriarch started it, the second generation grew up with it, they learned a little bit about it and now they are running it. This was family-run, from day one, with the people that were still involved. There is the question that, 20 or 30 years from now, when Eric and Victor’s children are involved – if that ends up being who is on it – how are they doing? I was mentoring one of them; he’s pretty cool.

Analyst 1: Eric and Victor are in their 50s so there are a lot of years of compounding with these two, hopefully?

Analyst 3: Exactly.

### One thing I think about is the terminal value of these businesses. Part of the bear case for Constellation or any of these companies, is that you are buying very mature stock.

Analyst 1: Yes, you have some terminal value risk.

### How do you compare the terminal value risk of someone like [[TransDigm]] versus [[HEICO]]? It’s much clearer in my mind about [[TransDigm]]’s terminal value, than [[HEICO]]’s, in terms of the underlying assets that they own, given the sole-source IP. You know the aftermarket size and, therefore, the value of that part in that market.

Analyst 3: Let me flip that on its head. In a sole-source environment, the only thing that is preventing competition is, typically, some sort of IP. It depends on which aspects of the IP you own or who you are working with. With [[TransDigm]], you have to split out government versus non-government because if that IP was developed or purchased and had also been developed using US government dollars, the US government owns the data rights to that and can take it and give it to another company, to invite competition. There is a huge push in the Department of Defense to get away from all sole-source.

I think that’s actually a lot more challenging to think through terminal value. If you are basing the terminal value on the fact that it is always going to be sole-source, as soon as that flip happens, does that go down 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%? I don’t know because it is going to be a function of growth and return on invested capital. I think that’s actually harder than taking a business where, essentially, you are making it a more attractive avenue for aircraft operators, to service their aircraft. You are doing it in a way where you are also using the competitive aspect of the OEMs slightly against them. That is the largest growth aspect of their business. They’re not making money on selling the plane; they’re making money on the aftermarket.

If they try and undercut you, their multiple goes down 80%. Somehow, I don’t think the CFOs and CEOs don’t want that. I think it’s easier to underwrite the terminal value here, for a [[HEICO]] compared to a [[TransDigm]].

Analyst 2: I’m not sure if there is a big difference between the two. What is the underlying driver in the business, both for [[HEICO]] or [[TransDigm]] or any of the others? On the FSG side of the business, for [[HEICO]], it’s the volume of passengers travelling. Yes, business travel has been negatively impacted by Covid, but on the road and in the air, we’ve seen the leisure travelers pick up the slack. That’s only likely to continue.

I’m originally from India and, just a few years ago, there was advertisement in a local newspaper from the CEO of a company called AirAsia, from Malaysia. It was a full-page ad on how to get ready for the first-time flyers. On a daily basis, from China and India alone, there are hundreds and thousands of people who are taking to the air for the first time. This was a few years ago, but they still are. It was about to pack for the air, how to use the toilet – many of the people, on the ground, may not have a restroom – and things like that.

The point is, the volume of travelers – both business and leisure – is only likely to continue, on the FSG side. ETG and the defense budget is only going up, as a result of this; not just in the US, but also in the EU and other parts of the world. That driver is even more robust than what it was just a few years ago. Within that, if airline operators are looking to keep their costs down and, on top of that, you have these lessors who are maybe more likely to join the crowd and keep the costs down.

The PMA part business and the MRO business is also only likely to continue to do better. The question then would be, how do they continue to grow? Both companies have acquisitive growth plans and acquisitive growth history. Will that continue on into the future? I think so. The human tendency to go and find independence and satisfaction in their work will still continue to drive engineers from Lockheed Martin and other companies to leave and go and set up their own businesses and they will be acquired eventually.

Analyst 1: I would say, for the impairment of these businesses, you could imagine having a part that’s on a certain plane that doesn’t fly anymore. Then that’s it. I don’t think that will happen. Firstly, they are well-diversified and they are adding so many more every year. I don’t think that risk is any greater than in any other business. You wouldn’t say that Apple has terminal value risk because the iPhone 12 is out; then there is an iPhone 13 and 14. The same thing applies here; they are creating new parts all the time.

On the ETG side, I don’t know. I think that might be harder to address but, again, I think the diversification there probably minimizes a lot of that risk.

### For [[HEICO]], what is the use case for owning the repair side of the business and MRO?

Analyst 3: The repair side of the business is probably one that is going to grow as well. When they repair an aircraft, they’re not taking in the whole plane; they’re only taking part of it.

### Distribution, as well?

Analyst 1: Yes.

Analyst 3: There are probably aspects to that too. It could be an interesting avenue for driving penetration and overall PMA parts, in the industry. Think of HVAC; who is the ultimate decision maker when a new air conditioner or a replacement is put in a house? It’s not the homeowner; it’s the HVAC repair man or installer. How is it that they are picking a carrier versus a train or somebody else? It’s what they are qualified on.

There is an aspect of that where, if you own some of the repair side, you have some say or, potentially, some influence on the overall trajectory of the PMA market and what ends up in which pieces. You are probably going to earn a decent return on that – not incredible – but if you think through the intangible benefits of having that type of business and how it can drive growth later, it’s probably worth it.

### For any of these companies, you can’t see the underlying margins they earn in the opcos. I know the margins in the distribution and repair business is much lower. The margins they earn on PMA must be pretty close to [[TransDigm]]’s, but the customer gets a better experience and a better price, related to what else is out there.

Analyst 3: I don’t think a company is saving money if they are making the decision between going with somebody else and [[TransDigm]]. I think there is an argument that an airline company is probably saving money by going to [[HEICO]] as opposed to going to the OEM.

Analyst 1: Yes; definitely.

### Back to the point as to what could potentially go wrong with [[HEICO]], acquisitions is really the main thing. What sort of acquisition would they have to make for you to be a bit concerned?

Analyst 3: A bad one.

Analyst 1: Or look at it a different way and say they don’t do one. If they start accumulating cash and aren’t doing deals, that won’t work.

Analyst 3: Again, think about the fact that they generate pretty good cash and they’ve got to put it to work somewhere. When your prior return on incremental invested capital was much higher, when you could buy a business at a five times EBITDA and now you’re having to pay 14, it reduces those returns which, in turn, reduces your value. I think it has to adjust what the business is worth, if they can no longer earn 30% or 40% returns on incremental invested capital and now they get 20%. This is where price matters. Does it mean it’s a bad company now? No. It just could mean that maybe it trades at a 25 multiple, as opposed to a 40.

### On the point that was mentioned earlier, that I thought was interesting, about defense. How do these contracts actually work? When [[HEICO]] go into a defense contract, what is the decision-making process from the customer, to end up choosing [[HEICO]] versus another parts provider?

Analyst 3: It’s going to depend. The military side, the ETG side, is going to be more about capability and cost is going to be a factor. If [[HEICO]] had tech and were the only one who could put a part on a satellite, then they’re going to get returns similar to [[TransDigm]]. Maybe they are not going to go and buy a company that has that sole part and then jack the price up 300% or 400%, but they might buy that company and they may be increasing those prices 7% or 8%, per year.

Even if they are able to buy that company at 14 times – so roughly a 7% yield – if you can add free growth to that, by just increasing your price 7% or 8% per year, instead of 400% in year one, it comes back to runway and altitude again. You can do that for 15 or 20 years. It’s free growth; you’re adding 7% and, next year, you’re getting 14%. The year after that, you’re up 21% on the original price. That’s just from price and that’s attractive. You don’t have to do it by pissing off your customer in year one and getting 400% and saying, I’m on this contract for 10 years and I’ll play the numbers. I’ll increase it 400% this year and, maybe, my renewal rate at year 10, goes from 90% to 60%. But the expected return is still high enough to do it.

For a [[HEICO]], maybe they say, I’m fine with just taking 7% of price, per year, and keeping my renewal of 90%. I don’t think that’s an irrational decision. Is it maximizing profit from an expected return standpoint? No. Are you potentially going to generate some goodwill with your customers and maybe get deals you wouldn’t have got otherwise? Yes. A lot less bad press from IG inspections.

Analyst 2: The other issue to keep an eye on is, if you look at the history of the type of transactions that [[HEICO]] has done, the deal size has been just a few hundred million dollars here and there. If they were to do a multi-billion-dollar deal, they have the cash and the capital is not an issue for them. But historically, that is not the size that they’ve gone for. In fact, if you look at [[TransDigm]], they have also done smaller deals but, out of the blue, they did this massive Esterline acquisition, just a few years ago and it took a bit of time to integrate; I don’t know if it is completely integrated. That sort of deal size, and not just the price alone – although price is, obviously, an important factor – would be an area I would keep an eye on.

Analyst 3: It’s very hard to say. If I saw an announcement, tomorrow, of a $4 billion acquisition, I would say, here we go, let’s dive in. It could either be massively successful but you’re going to take the L on it if it ends up being bad, because it’s going to take you a while to figure it out. The market is probably going to figure it out too; it’s the risk you run.

Analyst 2: I remember somebody mentioning, on this particular point, from the McKinsey Valuation book, they had a point about how these one-off massive deals, typically come back to bite.

Analyst 1: The acquisition question is one that takes a little nuance. Most people want acquisitions and that’s it. But smaller, programmatic acquisitions have a good track record. The larger the deal goes, the more risk and more value tends to be destroyed, looking back, over a long period of time. The odds would be against them on a really big deal.

The leverage is the other thing. They run a very strong balance sheet, unlike [[TransDigm]]. If they were to suddenly change that, I would be concerned.
