# Social Status

Social status among humans come usually in two flavours: *dominance* and *prestige*.

Dominance is clearly the result of competition, which can be often vicious and destructive. 

Prestige, meanwhile, seems much less competitive, at least on the surface. It's all about respect, which can't be taken by force, but rather must be freely conferred by admirers. Nevertheless, there's only so much respect to go around. In this regard, prestige is like a popularity contest. We earn prestige not just by being rich, beautiful, and good at sports, but also by being funny, artistic, smart, well-spoken, charming, and kind. **These are all _relative_ qualities, however.** 

Now, our competitions for prestige often produce positive side effects such as art, science, and technological innovation. But the prestige-seeking itself is more nearly a zero-sum game, which helps explain why we sometimes feel pangs of envy at even a close friend's success.
