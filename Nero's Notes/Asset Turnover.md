# Asset turnover

Asset turns are, in effect, a measure of a company's asset intensity. Or, put another way, how much capital needs to remain in the business in order to generate sales. 

Asset-light industries are attractive since they require less capital to be deployed in order to generate sales growth.  The finest examples are franchises like Domino's Pizza, where growth is funded by franchisees rather than by the company. Other instances include software businesses, such as Dassault Systemes, a leading European developer of design software.

One risk of low capital intensity business is attracting competition (see [[Capital Cycle]]) - evident in sectors such as online gambling, especially in Europe. Such companies must have additional advantages that reduce this risk of new entrants: brand in the case of Domino's and intellectual property in the case of Dassault.

However, high capital intensity companies can also be attractive, especially where the capital requirement confers stability and deters entrants.
