# Judges Scientific PLC analysis
 ## by Gorilla Game
 
 Judges Scientific (JDG: LSE) is a serial acquirer of niche scientific instruments businesses. These instruments are used in a range of testing and measurement applications by universities (~50% of sales), R&D departments and labs. The UK is a global leader in these types of instruments and the industry is characterized by specialization and fragmentation. These businesses typically have 20%+ EBIT margins and GDP+ organic growth. These businesses also typically have sub-£1m in EBIT and have historically been acquired for 4x to 6x EBIT from retiring founders. Over the last 10 years, Judges has redeployed 2/3rd of its capital in M&A driving 29% EPS cagr and 24% returns on capital (pre-tax).

Judges has a decentralized organizational structure allowing managers to run their subsidiaries with autonomy. This model makes Judges an attractive home for sellers looking to monetize or retire who don’t want their business sold into private equity or absorbed into a strategic acquirer. Judges also provides significant support in the form of higher R&D spend, shared use capabilities, coaching, succession planning, and recruiting. Judges organizational model has similarities to Halma, albeit at far smaller scale. In fact, Judges COO who runs day-to-day operations is a 16-year Halma veteran who was formerly the CEO of Halma’s Process Safety Division and Halma’s former head of M&A.

**Background**

Judges Scientific was originally an investment vehicle called Judges Capital listed by David Cicurel and Alex Hambro on the AIM in 2003. Cicurel was a turnaround specialist and Hambro was a private equity executive. Judges’ initial strategy was to acquire small undervalued public companies, initiate a shake-up then encourage them to sell to private equity at a higher price. The small cap index in the UK doubled in 2003 and the strategy was no longer viable. Cicurel began looking at different types of deals, and found one that was particularly interesting. According to an interview he gave in the Daily Telegraph,

> _“It had £3m turnover and £750,000 operating profit, with 19 staff. It looked too good to be true. The owners were an engineer and a scientist, who were both looking to retire. They explained they had a dominating position in a tiny world niche and that the drivers of the business were regulation and globalization”_.

This business ended up being FTT, Judges first acquisition (a Halma-like business focused on fire safety). Following FTT, Judges began to exclusively focus on niche scientific instruments. Cicurel and Hambro remain as CEO and Chairman. Judges hired Brad Ormsby as CFO in 2015, who prior to Judges was CFO of Kalibrate, a vertical market software company that he helped IPO in 2014. The team was complemented with the hiring of Mark Lavelle as COO in 2017, who had previously spent 16 years at Halma. David Cicurel owns 10% of Judges.

The strategy has commonalities with many serial acquirers but the question is really execution. Simplistically, the strategy is:

-   Niche end markets favoring fragmentation rather than scale
    
-   Highly technical products supporting high margins
    
-   GDP+ end-markets
    
-   Pay a low multiple but provide flexibility and certainty of close
    
-   No integration or synergies but nudge owners towards best practices
    
-   Provide capital if needed and increase R&D spending
    
-   Have the COO as a backup in case anything goes wrong with succession
    

**Acquisition Track Record**

Below is a summary of Judges track record.

![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ded45a_4bddbedac7cd4914b5430aba35755609~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_956,h_591,al_c,q_90/ded45a_4bddbedac7cd4914b5430aba35755609~mv2.webp)

Judges has “clean accounting” meaning R&D is fully expensed, no goodwill impairments, minimal add-backs, etc. Management calculates ROTIC using Adj. EBITA (annualizing acquisitions) divided by total invested capital adding back all amortized intangibles to the denominator. The T = Total Capital, not Tangible Capital. Given the business takes negligible tangible capital, the ROIC is essentially a function of acquisition multiples.

Management has sustained 24% pre-tax ROTIC which implies a 20% post-tax ROTIC. There are some business-specific factors as to why ROTIC was depressed between 2014-17 and if those issues are fixed, post-tax ROTIC should trend closer to mid-20% over time.

Judges paid out a big dividend in 2019 because it did not identify any targets that year and there was some risk of a higher dividend tax from a new labor government but in aggregate, Judges has deployed 65% of FCF into M&A since 2006.

The key question going forward is how much Judges can continue to deploy and at what ROTIC. For example, if Judges continued to deploy 65% of FCF on average for 10 years at 6x EBIT, my rough math is that Judges has to do ~25m in M&A in 2030 which is 4 to 5 deals at an average deal size of £4m to £5m each, well below the threshold where deals start becoming competitive. In other words, Judges has a very long runway. They've already done a £13m deal (Scientifica in 2013) and an £8m deal (GDS in 2012).

**Back of the Envelope Valuation**

Judges did £14m in Adj. Earnings in 2019 and £12m in Adj. Earnings in 2020. Since 2019, Judges acquired Moorgate in December 2019, (£0.6m in EBIT), Heath Scientific in March 2020 (£0.7m in EBIT) and Korvus in October 2020 (£0.7m in EBIT) which gets you to £2m in incremental EBIT or £1.5m in earnings. Adding this to 2019, you get to £15.5m in normalized earnings or 240p in EPS. Judges tax rate has been a low due to some SME tax credits which will fall away so adjusting for a more normalized 20% tax rate going forward, Judges would be doing more like 225p in EPS.

-   At 6300p, Judges trades at 28x normalized earnings or ~3.6% earnings yield. FCF conversion is ~100%. Once you redeploy 65% of FCF into M&A, the earnings yield becomes 1%.
    
-   Judges can organically grow 6%+ and in fact, average organic growth (incl. the 12% decline in 2020) has been 7.4% since 2006 A lot of the lost 2020 sales were deferred, not cancelled, as some of the installations have to be done in-person so we should see this bounce back once travel normalizes
    
-   Judges can redeploy 65% of FCF at ~18% post-tax ROIC driving 12% additional earnings growth. I think the ROIC will ultimately shake out to be much higher. Judges will also use modest leverage for the right deal but is currently almost net cash.
    
-   In 2030, Judges will only be doing £300m in revenue and £60m in EBIT, giving it plenty of opportunities to continue to acquire niche scientific instruments business, so Judges can likely support an above average exit multiple. Assuming an 18x exit multiple, Judges has about 4% annual headwind from multiple compression.
    
-   1% FCF yield + 6% organic growth + 12% inorganic growth - 4% multiple compression gets you to a rough math **~15% 10-year IRR at today's price.**
    
-   It is not hard to see a scenario where M&A growth is significantly higher and the exit multiple also significantly higher given Judges still relatively small size.
    
-   If Judges does evolve into more of a "Halma-type" business with multiple sector CEOs, more formalized shared use resources, and can sustain/grow its culture, then the upside is materially higher.
    

**Thesis**

Judges has many of the elements to be a very successful serial acquirer:

-   Size: they are still small so have a multi-decade horizon until they run into very competitive bidding scenarios
    
-   Culture: they have a management team that buys into the decentralized culture, which is "Halma-lite", Halma likely being one of the best examples of a good serial acquirer
    
-   Management: The CEO and members of the board have significant skin in the game, with the CEO being the largest shareholder
    
-   End-Markets: The markets are fragmented, niche, favor specialization rather than scale, naturally high margin, and have opportunities to organically grow above GDP
    

At the current price, you can use reasonable assumptions to get to a 15% IRR. If things go really badly and the business blows up, the business has historically not used much leverage (2.5x limit) and the experience during COVID has demonstrated the relative resilience of the portfolio (15% EPS decline, albeit with some M&A benefits), i.e. some subsidiaries zig while others zag. Moreover, management has significant skin in the game.

**Acquisition Strategy**

Typical Target and Structure

Judges targets niche scientific instruments companies that are founder-led, high-margin (20% EBIT), and have GDP+ organic growth. Because of how niche the products are, the company is typically a leader globally within their niche, often with just one or two competitors, and in fact, exports account for 88% of Judges’ revenue. For most of these products, accuracy and quality are far more important to price and hence the high margins. For example, some of Judges vacuum instrumentation is used at particle accelerators like CERN.

The typical seller is a founder engineer/scientist looking to monetize and/or retire but find a good home for their business. Despite the CEO’s background in turnarounds, Judges is not interested in turnarounds or synergy-driven deals.

Judges model is paying 3x to 6x EBIT. The primary consideration is cash (£1.8m of equity issued out of ~£64m in total consideration since 2005). Judges is flexible on transaction structure and can take a minority interest (e.g. Oxford Cryosystems) or acquire in phases (e.g. PE Fiberoptic).

Judges believes this multiple is sustainable in the medium term and multiples depend more on timing of retirements and individual circumstances rather than on the economy or interest rates. Judges is far smaller than Diploma for example, which itself has a decade plus runway.

Judges says it will leverage to 2.5x for the right deal which would imply that it could do a £80m deal for a £13m EBIT business but Judges has kept leverage below 2.0x for most of its history and is close to net cash today.

**Deal Sourcing and Due Diligence**

Judges is not at a phase where it has a high enough volume of deals to have a formalized corporate development initiative. Deal making is done at the head office, which is basically comprised of 3 people. This will evolve over time.

Judges believes the immediate opportunity is in the UK where they believe there are 2,000 potential targets where they have strong interest in at least 200 should they come up for sale. The UK is a global leader in scientific instruments. The industry is fragmented as it is extremely specialized and technical. Judges looks globally and has done one deal in Belgium but the UK is the immediate focus. Judges has historically closed 1 to 4 deals a year. The CEO has said on calls that it expects good deal flow post-COVID in 2022 and 2023.

The CEO holds primary responsibility for deal sourcing and due diligence. Judges sources deals via a combination of inbound interest, referrals from subsidiary MDs and from brokers. Judges has developed a local reputation amongst scientific instruments companies in the UK. Many of these businesses tend to be clustered around a specific region or university which allows Judges' subsidiary MD's to develop relationships with them over time

Judges has developed a reputation for a “clean sale” and a smooth process. For small deals, it is common for acquirers to make an offer prior to doing full due diligence, then change the offer after due diligence. Judges is willing to absorb the full cost on due diligence upfront despite only closing on a minority of deals giving founders deal certainty and avoid the headache of re-marketing the business.

Succession

You can simplistically think of Judges main value proposition to founders as offering the most flexible succession plan but with the trade-off of receiving a modestly lower price. Judges in turn accepts the succession risk, but diversifies it across multiple subsidiaries and always has a backup plan. The succession plan typically involves the founder staying on for a few more years or a co-founder or senior employee taking sole leadership. Judges does not handcuff founders to commit to staying post-close, knowing that even if they do, their mindset may change once ownership changes hands. Earn-outs if they are put in place are often just 1 year.

The COO is the insurance plan. While Judges only has one "operating group", the COO's role reminds me of something [[Mark Leonard]] wrote in his 2012 letter.

> _We currently manage our 125 independent business units through 5 Operating Groups. The Operating Groups have accounting, acquisition, and IT functions, and varying degrees of HR, tax, shared R&D and legal capabilities. **They also have a number of relatively senior staff who can be parachuted into large new acquisitions or troubled situations. The Operating Groups serve extremely valuable functions as coaches, capital deployers, occasional recruiters and “single point of management failure” insurance.**_

Integration

Judges does not pursue synergies. While Judges is hands-off, most founders do not have strong business acumen given they have science backgrounds so Judges, similar to Halma, can offer valuable coaching and support without getting involved in the day-to-day running of the business. This is made very clear in videos on Judges websites targeted at potential sellers. Judges will over time start developing more shared-use capabilities, which right now are limited to basic things around procurement, office space, etc.

The video on Judges website interviews existing subsidiary MD's, and really emphasizes the point that Judges is a "good" buyer that won't mess with your business.

[Acquisition Model | Judges Scientific](https://www.judges.uk.com/main/acquisition-model.html)

**Organizational Structure**

Judges has a small head-office led by a CEO, CFO and COO. The COO is in Halma-terms basically Judges first “Sector CEO” and overseas the subsidiaries. The COO overseas 16 subsidiaries. All subsidiaries are run by an MD, which are often times the founder. Subsidiaries are required to have strong financial reporting and Judges may help recruit a financial controller if necessary, but subsidiaries are allowed to retain their fit-for-purpose ERP systems. As Judges scales, the COO’s responsibilities will likely be split and a new division created.

At a high level, the organic growth opportunity is for Mark Lavelle, an experienced executive with 16 years’ experience at a best-in-class operator Halma, to coach 16 small businesses with average revenue of £5m.

-   Many of these businesses have not invested in recruiting. There are significant opportunities to recruit new employees in sales and R&D to launch new products and expand geographically or across industries. The COO can help undertake basic steps like hiring an overseas sales director in the US or even a new domestic sales director while spreading these risks out across the larger Judges group.
    
-   Many of these businesses were too small to significantly grow overseas. The COO said that introduction to new distributor relationships and use of overseas shared use capabilities could be significant.
    
-   Many of these businesses have not implemented strong business practices. There are significant opportunities to improve sales efficiency by putting in better sales processes, working capital collections, and optimize pricing.
    
-   Many of these businesses did not always pursue obvious capital projects. Mark Lavelle pointed out on a call that rather than go after 3-year paybacks, there were dozens of £50,000 type projects where the payback might be 3 months.
    
-   Finally and perhaps most importantly, Judges encourages higher spending on R&D, especially as it can diversify this risk across multiple subsidiaries, which is something these businesses could not have done on their own. R&D spending typically goes from ~4% up to the group average of ~6%.
    

**Management**

David Cicurel (~70 years old, largest shareholder with 10.4%/£42m stake)

David Cicurel founded the company and you can get a sense for his personality from the earnings calls. He has implemented a true "decentralized" philosophy and ceded autonomy to his COO and subsidiary MDs. He also comes across as very disciplined on the financial front, although he does acknowledge that multiples will eventually rise (albeit, once you pay 8x for a business, every other seller demands 8x, so now is not the time to step-up). The main concern is his age, although, I would suspect that Mark Lavelle would be a natural successor with a similar strategy/philosophy.

Mark Lavelle (~60 years old) – Options are worth ~£2.4m

Mark Lavelle joined the company in 2017. He spent 16 years at Halma including senior positions as CEO of two operating groups and as head of M&A. I asked around and confirmed that he left Halma voluntarily. Judging by investor presentations, he seems very aligned with the "Judges Culture" which is basically "Halma-lite". Hiring a former head of M&A with CEO experience is like a small industrial small cap in the US hiring the former COO of Danaher. There is a lot of low hanging fruit to go after.

Brad Ormsby (~40 years old) – Options are worth ~£1.0m

Brad Ormsby joined in 2015. Prior to that, he had 3 years’ experience as CFO including taking a company public and 6 years’ experience as controller of a public investment firm focused on technology. Beyond his CFO role, Brad helps with M&A. Judging by investor presentations, he seems aligned in terms of corporate culture and likley capable of becoming the CEO given the role is about sustaining the culture and leading capital allocation.

Shares of Judges are AIM rather than LSE listed. There is an interesting quirk with being AIM listed. In the UK, the inheritance tax is 40% on assets above a £375,000 but AIM-listed shares are exempt from inheritance tax as long as shares are held for at least 2 years. Should this rule stay in place (could change), it is in management's strong interest to hold onto shares and pass the business on to very capable managers, given the significant inheritance tax benefits.

Board of Directors

The board is comprised of the CEO, CFO and COO and 5 independent directors, chaired by Alex Hambro. The board is small but 3 non-executive board members own material amounts of stock. Given Judges relatively small size, I am happy with the strength of Judges board and the strong levels of inside ownership.

-   Alex Hambro (owns ~£4m in stock) is the original Chairman and still retains that position. He is a private equity executive. He worked in various PE firms, started his own. He is currently also Chairman of AIM-listed Falanx Group, a cyber security company and Non-Executive Director of Octopus Apollo, Hertsford Capital, Whitley Asset Management and Crescent Capital.
    
-   Ralph Cohen (owns £3.6m in stock) was the Finance Director of Judges Scientific plc for nearly ten years until his retirement in 2015. He held various senior executive positions within the energy and water divisions of the Paris based Vivendi group between 1981 and 2001, including eight years as Finance Director of a listed subsidiary, followed by positions as Managing Director within that group.
    
-   Ralph Elman (owns £4m in stock) is a former Finance Director of listed companies Paramount plc, Delyn plc and International Communication & Data plc and Finance Director of businesses within GUS plc and RR Donnelley.
    
-   Charles Holroyd (owns £127k) - most recently Charles worked as a senior executive at Oxford Instruments, which he joined in 1999 and where he served on the board from 2005 until 2013 and was responsible for group business development including M&A activities.
    
-   Glynn Reece has worked in corporate finance deal origination and advisory services, working for Coopers & Lybrand, Arthur Andersen and CLB. He is currently a Proprietor of Carl Reiss Meyer, a business that acts as an arranger of pre-flotation finance for small fast-growing companies.
    

If the CEO gets hit by a bus, I believe either the COO or CFO would become CEO. Based on the high inside ownership and from listening to calls, I don't believe the company will suddenly change into a "integration cost cutting" culture although this is a subjective judgement. The fact that they've been able to attract someone of Mark Lavelle's caliber is a good sign.

Financial Incentives

There is nothing special about compensation. Base salaries look reasonable with all executives getting paid under £200k. The annual bonus for the Executive Directors is set at 25% of base salary upon achieving annual earnings per share targets set within the annual budget. Additionally, no bonus can be achieved if earnings per share is below a historical high watermark. Share are also rewarded to executives that vest over 3 years. Shares only vest if a minimum 6% cagr in earnings has been achieved over the 3-year vesting period. Mark Lavelle’s (COO) has 64k options with a ~1,935p strike, meaning they are effectively valued at around £2.4m. Brad Ormsby’s 30k options have a 1,475p strike meaning they are effectively valued around £1m.

In terms of MD compensation, Judges Scientific does not have an aggressive compensation structure like Halma, which pays up to 150% of base salary as bonuses. Rather, incentive compensation for MDs is typically around 25% of base but on a case-by-case basis. Given Judge's relatively small size, some of the Founder/MDs are more "engineering/science people" rather than "business people" so this structure makes sense. At Halma, the average subsidiary size is about 6x larger meaning the MD is more of a professional CEO.

**Summary of the deals**

Below is a summary of the deals. There isn't any significant trend in terms of multiples inflating. They have all been around 4x to 6x EBIT.

**Summary of performance**

Because the subsidiaries are all UK based, you can actually look at Companies House to see subsidiary level data albeit the EBIT numbers are likely a little less accurate than the Revenue numbers given Judges might move costing around between subsidiaries.

Commentary

-   From 2006 to 2011, organic growth was high-teens. Clearly, 15% to 20% organic growth is not the trajectory of this business but the company believes there are opportunities to sustain the historical growth which is HSD.
    
-   Organic growth was volatile in 2014 and 2016. The weak growth in 2014 was due to the economy combined with a strong sterling and weak 2016 growth was due to issues at Armfield. Excluding Armfield, organic growth would have been 9% in 2016.
    
-   There is some concentration with the top 3 at 50% of EBIT. However, there wasn’t one business driving the majority of growth but rather growth was spread out across multiple subsidiaries.
    
-   It is worth pointing out that for a small company, Judges geographic exposure is very diversified at roughly 30% N. America, 30% Europe, 12% UK, 10% China/HK and 28% ROW.
    

Below are the EBIT numbers per companies-house.

![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ded45a_5fd3afa3da50453b8b29022714c0b2f9~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1109,h_655,al_c,q_90/ded45a_5fd3afa3da50453b8b29022714c0b2f9~mv2.webp)

Commentary

-   Judges' stated goal is to buy companies with EBITA margins around 20% and it has achieved high-teens margins (EBITA) historically which is much higher than Oxford and Spectris and roughly in-line with Halma’s.
    
-   The COO believes there are opportunities to improve margins although they will happen over time, driven by “culture” and investment into high-ROIC projects rather than cost cutting.
    
-   Aitchee was a key sub-contractor for FTT and FTT was Aitchee’s biggest customer at the time of acquisition. The acquisition provided security of supply. This is why Aitchee runs at low profitability as the majority of sales are related-party sales.
    
-   Scientifica (14% of Revenue, 4% of EBIT) and Armfield (12% of Revenue, 2% of EBIT) have been the underperforming acquisitions and I will describe them more below. The rest of the businesses have generated high-teens or higher EBIT margins on average although the results have been lumpy.
    

Most businesses are focused on design and assembly rather than manufacturing so returns on tangible capital are high and capex has averaged around 2% of revenue. Capex did elevate in 2013 due to new factories for Quorum and UHV. In general, Judges guides toward a 3-year payback for any major capital spend, which are minimal.

The key issue is that 2 of Judges' largest deals have run into issues. Judges does not detail subsidiary level issues in their earnings reports or calls. Bear in mind that Judges overall performance was strong despite these deals from 2013 onwards given Judges ultimately has a very diversified portfolio. Given the strength of the aggregate portfolio level performance, I am willing to give management the benefit of the doubt, especially as they have an experienced executive with M&A experience at Halma as their COO. If I’m wrong, it means management is capable of executing on £5m deals but for some reason, not capable of executing on £10m deals. I frankly don’t believe the execution on a £5m versus £10m deal should be materially different.

Armfield (Acquired Jan 2015 for £9.8m)

Judges acquired Armfield in 2015 from two managers, both of whom continued in their roles post-acquisition but have since retired. Armfield makes industrial food testing equipment used primarily for education and research. They are a global leader in this niche. After the company was acquired in 2015 for 4.8x trailing EBIT, sales slowed in 2015 and were hit again in 2016 as a result of lower oil and commodity prices, which hit Armfield’s customers in emerging markets particularly hard. At the time, 55% of sales were to ROW with large exposure to emerging markets. The £3.3m drop in Armfield sales was significant, hitting Judges total revenue by 6%. Sales bounced back the following year. Margins continued to be single-digits in 2018 versus 16% in 2014 due to operating de-leverage. Sales and margins were hit again in 2019, although it is unclear why. Based on what I can gather, Armfield looks to be the one deal that has not worked out having gone from 12% of EBITA in 2015 to 2% as of 2019.

Scientifica (Acquired July 2013 for £13m)

Judges acquired Scientifica in 2013 from three owners who founded the company in 1996. Scientifica develops and distributes equipment to enhance the research of neurons, neuronal circuits and animal behavior. Exports account for 75% of sales with the US being the biggest end-market. Judges acquired the company for £13.4m or 6.0x historical EBIT making it their biggest acquisition to date. On acquisition, one of the founders left as planned while the other two remained as MD and as Sales Director. After Judges acquisition, Scientifica grew higher than average in 2014 and 2015 but could not execute on their order book, and ran into delays shipping products to end-customers. This resulted in a significant hit to margins as Scientifica tried to fix the issues. Apparently, from 2015 to 2017, Judges ran into succession issues further exacerbating the execution issues but the company looks to be under new leadership as of 2020. It is unclear how Scientifica is trending after 2019.

**Projected Financials**

Back of the envelope is the best way to project out serial acquirers in my view given you do not know the revenue and margin drivers in advance, but just to sense-check my forecast, below is loosely what financials would look like assuming 7% organic growth and 65% of FCF redeployed at 6x EBIT. I would expect multiples to be a little lower in the near-term and the redeployment rate to be higher longer-term.

**Overview of Subsidiaries**

Given the fragmentation of the subsidiaries, it is difficult have an in-depth understanding of each individual subsidiary so with a company like Judges, you are taking above average business risk as the growth prospects, competitive environment, etc. are difficult to analyze. However, the risks are diversified.

**Quorum Technologies (15% of Sales)**

-   Judges acquired Quorum from its founder in 2009. Quorum designs, manufactures and distributes sample preparation instruments for use in electron microscopy. Samples for electron microscopy need to be electrically conductive to achieve clarity of images. Samples therefore need to go through some combination of cleaning, drying, coating or freezing. Products can cost £4k for entry level all the way to £20k. Lithium battery research is a big growth driver.
    
-   Customers include universities, forensic labs, as well as major manufacturers of electron microscopes such as Hitachi. The US is the biggest market followed by Asia. The technology is used in life and material sciences as well as semiconductor production.
