# Decisions : The Pathway to Power

*How am I going to live the next ten years of my life? How am I going to live **today** in order to create the tomorrow I'm committed to? What am I going to stand for **from now on**? What's important to me right now, and what will be important to me in the long term? What actions can I take today that will shape my ultimate destiny?*

**NOW is the time to design the next ten years of your life.**

The most powerful way to shape our lives is to get ourselves to *take action*.The difference in the results that people produce comes down to what they've done differently from others in the same situation. **Different actions produce different results.** Why? Because any action is a cause set in motion, and its effect builds on past effects to move us in a definite direction. Every direction leads to an ultimate destination: our destiny. 

In essence, if we want to direct our lives, we must take control of our consistent actions. **It's not what we do once in a while that shapes our lives, but what we do consistently.** The key and most important question, then, is this: *What precedes all of our actions? What determines what actions we take, and therefore, who we become, and what our ultimate destination is in life? What is the father of action?*

The answer, of course, is what I've been alluding to all along: **the power of decision.** Everything that happens in your life - both what you're thrilled with and what you're challenged by - began with a decision.  **I believe that it's in your moments of decision that your destiny is shaped.** The decisions that you're making right now, every day, will shape how you feel today as well as who you're going to become in ten years and beyond.

**If you don't make decisions about how you're going to live, then you've already made a decision, haven't you?** You're making a decision to be directed by the environment instead of shaping your own destiny.

My whole life changed in just one day - the day I determined not just what I'd *like* to have in my life or what I wanted to become, but when I **decided who and what I was *committed* to having and being in my life.** That's a simple distinction, but an important one.

You have to set standards for what you consider to be acceptable behavior for yourself and decide what you should expect from those you care about. **If you don't set a baseline standard for what you'll accept in your life, you'll find it's easy to slip into behaviors and attitudes or a quality of life that's far below what you deserve.** You need to set and live by these standards no matter what happens in your life.

Using the power of decision gives you the capacity to get past any excuse to change any and every part of your life *in an instant*. It can change your relationships, your working environment, your level of physical fitness, your income and your emotional state.

**If you truly decide to, you can do almost anything.** So if you don't like the current relationship you're in, make the decision to change it. If you don't like your current job, change it. If you don't like the way you feel about yourself, change it. If it's a higher level of physical vitality and health you want, you can change it now. In a moment you can seize the same power that has seized history.

Many people say, "Well, I'd love to make a decision like that, but I'm not sure *how* I could change my life." They're paralyzed by the fear that they don't know exactly how to turn their dreams into reality. And as a result, they never make the decisions that could make their lives into the masterpieces they deserve to be. 

It's not important initially to know how you're going to create a result.  What's important is to know that **you will find a way**, no matter what. The elementary process for getting where you want to go is:
1. Decide what you want,
2. Take action
3. Notice what's working or not
4. Change your approach until you achieve what you want.

Deciding to produce a result causes events to be set in motion. If you simply decide what is it you want, get yourself to take action, learn from it, and change your approach, then you will create the momentum to achieve the result. As soon as you truly commit to making something happen, the *how* will reveal itself.


Making a true decision, unlike saying "I'd like to quit smoking," is cutting off any other possibility. In fact, the word "decision" comes from the Latin roots *de*, which means "from", and *caedere*, which means "to cut". **Making a true decision means committing to achieving a result, and then cutting yourself off form any other possibility.**

This kind of clarity gives you power. With clarity, you can produce the results that you really want for your life.


**The way to make better decisions is to make more of them.** Then make sure you learn from each one, including those that don't seem to work out in the short term: they will provide valuable distinctions to make better evaluations and therefore decisions in the future. Realize that decision making, like any other skill you focus on improving, gets better the more often you do it. The more often you'll take decisions, the more you'll realize that you truly are in control of your life. You'll look forward to future challenges, and you'll see them as an opportunity to make new distinctions and move your life to the next level.

**Information is power when it's acted upon**, and one of my criteria for a true decision is that action flows from it. Repetition is the mother of skill.


Three decisions that you make every moment of your life control your destiny. These three decisions determine what you'll notice, how you'll feel, what you'll do, and ultimately what you will contribute and who you become. If you don't control these three decisions, you simply aren't in control of your life. When you do control them, you begin to sculpt your experience. 
 
 
The three decisions that control your destiny are:
1. Your decision about **what to focus on.**
2. Your decision about **what things mean to you.**
3. Your decision about **what to do to create the results you desire.**


You see, it's not what's happening to you now or what has happened in your past that determines who you become. Rather, **it's your decisions about what to focus on, what things mean to you, and what you're going to do about them that will determine your ultimate destiny.**

Know that if anyone is enjoying greater success than you in any area, they're making these three decisions differently from you in some context or situation.



Although you may never have even thought about it, your brain has already constructed an internal system for making decisions. This system acts like an invisible force, directing all of your thoughts, actions, and feelings, both good and bad, every moment that you live. It controls how you evaluate everything in your life, and it's largely driven by your subconscious mind. The scary thing is that *most people never consciously set this system up.* Instead, it's been installed through the years by sources as diverse as parents, peers, teachers, television, advertisers, and the culture at large.

This system is comprised of five components:
1. **Your core beliefs and unconscious rules**
2. **Your life values**
3. **Your references**
4. **The habitual questions that you ask yourself**
5. **The emotional states** you experience in each moment.

By changing any of these five elements - whether it is a core belief or rule, a value, a reference, a question, or an emotional state - you can immediately produce a powerful and measurable change in your life. Most importantly, you'll be fighting the causes rather than the effects.


The good news is that we can override this system by making conscious decisions at any moment in our lives. **We don't have to allow the programming of our past to control our present and future.**


One of the most important decisions you can make to ensure your long-term happiness is to decide to **use whatever life gives you in the moment.** The truth of the matter is that there's nothing you can't accomplish if:
1. You clearly decide what it is that you're absolutely committed to achieving.
2. You are willing to take massive action.
3. You notice what's working or not.
4. You continue to change your approach until you achieve what you want, using whatever life give you along the way.

Success is the result of making small decisions: deciding to hold yourself to a higher standard, deciding to contribute, deciding to feed your mind rather than letting your environment to control you - these small decisions create the life experience we call success. 




## Harness the Power of Decisions

In review, let me give you six quick keys to help you harness the power of decision, the power that shapes your experience of life every moment that you live it:

1. **Remember the true power of making decisions.** It's a tool you can use in any moment to change your entire life. The minute you make a new decision, you set in motion a new cause, effect, direction, and destination for your life. You literally begin to change the moment you make a new decision. Remember that when you start feeling overwhelmed, or when you feel like you don't have a choice,  or when things are happening "*to*" you, you can change it all  if you just stop and decide to do so. **Remember, a real decision is measured by the fact that you've taken new action.** If there's no action, you haven't truly decided.
2. **Realize that the hardest step in achieving anything is making a true commitment - a true decision**. Carrying out your commitment is often much easier than the decision itself, so make your decisions intelligently, but make them quickly. Don't labor forever over the question of how or if you can do it. Studies have shown that the most successful people make decisions rapidly because they are clear on their values and what they really want for their lives. The same studies show that they are slow to change their decisions, if at all. On the other hand, people who fail usually make decisions slowly and change their mind quickly, always bouncing back and forth. Just decide!
	Realize that decision making is a kind of act in itself, so a good definition for a decision might be "information acted upon." You know you've truly made a decision when action flows from it. It becomes a cause set in motion. Often the effect of making a decision helps create the attainment of a larger goal. A critical value I've made for myself is **never to leave the scene of a decision without first taking a *specific* action toward its realization.**
	
3. **Make decision often.** The more decisions you make, the better you're going to become at making them. Muscles get stronger with use, and so it is with your decision-making muscles. Unleash your power right now by making some decisions you've been putting off. You won't believe the energy and excitement it will create in your life!
4. **Learn from your decisions.** There's no way around it. At times, you're going to screw up, no matter what you do. And when the inevitable happens, instead of beating yourself into the ground, **learn something.** Ask yourself, "What's good about this? What can I learn from this?" This "failure" may be an unbelievable gift in disguise if you use it to make better decisions in the future. Rather than focus on the short term setback, choose instead to learn lessons that can save you time. money, or pain, and that will give you the ability to succeed in the future.
5.  **Stay committed to your decisions, but stay flexible in your approach.** Once you've decided who you want to be as a person, for example, don't get stuck on the means of achieving it. It's the end you're after. Too often, in deciding what they want for their lives, people pick the best way they know at the time - they make a map - but then don't stay open to alternate routes. Don't become rigid in your approach. Cultivate the art of flexibility.
6.  **Enjoy making decisions.** You must know that in any moment a decision you make can change the course of your life forever: the very next person you stand behind in line or sit next to on an airplane, the very next phone call you make or receive, the very next movie you see or book you read of page you turn could be the one single thing that cause the floodgates to open, and all of the things that you've been waiting for to fall into place.
