# Non-Zero Sum Relationships

The world will do most of the work for us, provided we align ourselves with how the world actually operates. Part of that reality is acknowledging that everything is connected. Naturalist John Muir observed, "When we try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe." Business is fundamentally about relationships. Compromise any one single relationship and you'll find it negatively affecting others.

Intelligent Fanatics have aligned themselves with this reality by treating each of their business relationships as equals. In other words, they set up win-win, mutually beneficial relationships with customers, shareholders, employees, communities (environment), suppliers, and the government. As Jim Sinegal, cofounder of [[Costco]], often said, "This way of doing business is not altruism. It is good business." Notice that many of the contrasting examples in each chapter possessed far greater numbers of zero-sum relationships, whereas the profiled intelligent fanatic-led organizations possessed all, or nearly all, win-win relationships. "Good business" unlocks an organization's true potential, getting the world to work for it. Operating in such a fashion provides the greatest staying power.
