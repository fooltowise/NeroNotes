# What do I want from Philosophy


> What is the fruit of these teachings? Only the most beautiful and proper harvest of the truly educated  - tranquility, fearlessness and freedom.

Epictetus,  _Discourses_



If I can control my choices, (see [[Epictetus on control and choice]]), ultimately by applying a good philosophy of life I should reach a state where I can act with courage on what I can control and not be moved by what I cannot.

In such a state I would be a free man.
