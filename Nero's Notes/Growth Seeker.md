# Growth Seeker Personality

### Overview

Typical Growth Seekers have an endless fascination with personal growth, meaning they devote themselves to improvement and evolution. They possess a never-ending curiosity about the world and how they fit into it. They have a thirst for knowledge and a need to understand the world and the people in it, particularly in service of personal and professional growth. If it makes them more effective, it’s on their to-do list. They are open to any constructive advice, even if it’s tough to swallow. They are flexible and adaptive to new experiences and circumstances.

Other distinguishing characteristics include being composed, grounded, and balanced in their approach to managing stress and pressure. They love engaging new ideas and information and making sense of things for themselves. They can often be both determined and humble; they love to challenge themselves, but don't stress too much over mistakes made. In fact, they know the ability to reflect well on their failures is key to their personal growth.

At times, their desire to reflect inwardly first before acting can slow down their response time. They may need a stronger push to force action and decisiveness. And while some Growth Seekers are natural leaders, many are comfortable being good followers. The key is understanding their nature and finding a path that’s right for them—which is ultimately where the Growth Seekers, with their capacity for introspection and adaptation, shine.
