### Lindsay,what are your role and responsibilities at William Buck?

I am Lindsay Holloway, the managing director of William Buck in Victoria, Australia and also the deputy chair of the William Buck Group. My role is largely based on delivering the performance of the business, which encompasses a broad range, from people and finance to the operational perspective. This also takes a short and a long-term view from both a strategic and a cultural development perspective.

### Can you describe the size, structure and philosophy of William Buck?

William Buck is a consolidated group of six firms with a turnover of $130 million and 1,000 people, with 120 partners across six jurisdictions in Australia and New Zealand. Our business in Victoria has a turnover of $35 million and 200 people with 25 partners. Our clients generally need a range of services and we have a hub and spoke model. We have the clients and propose running accounting services, tax accounting, audit, corporate advisory, tax consulting, insolvency and wealth advisory.

We have also recently taken several investments to expand our services beyond the traditional model by pushing into digital marketing and HR. Whilst it differs to the broader big four model, we see opportunity in whatever we can find to leverage off our clients.

### What is the revenue split by service line?

Historically, the firm was a larger business advisory, which is the accounting tax to the SME level. That has moved to 50% in what we call BA, 25% in audit and the allied specialist services make up 5% to 10% of each of the remaining 25%. Our goal is to squash the business advisory down and open up more traditional or specialist services.

### Do those specialist services include wealth advisory?

Yes, and tax consulting, corporate advisory, mergers and acquisitions, valuations and more advisory services into HR. We had a number of roles in staff engagement surveys, so it is opening up those more specialist roles and the opportunity for us is quite significant.

### How do you define the mid-market, where William Buck seems to operate?

The SME market is our broad church in Australia, but the goal of our firm is to be more in the M, not the S. What we are doing is moving away from the smaller mum-and-dad corner shop type businesses to what we call mid-market businesses with more complexity. They should have more than one owner and revenue of between $5 million and $300 million. We have larger retail businesses as customers which turnover $1 billion, but by and large, the market is around the $50 to 100 million mark, with 500 staff. Beyond accounting and tax, they have complexities which will need solving that our business can help them with.

### Why do you prefer to work in the mid-market rather than the smaller side?

Not many businesses will try to service the mid-market. The big four aim for large international listed businesses who need that capability. Some larger mid-tier firms try to be that alternative, then you have the smaller rung where there are accountants on every corner, doing compliance-based work. The mid-market allows us to be able to differentiate ourselves by having commercial advice and to be a partner in business. From that perspective we can get a higher rate because it is not so commoditized down in the lower level. We cannot take on the big four; it is about knowing your market, becoming experts and looking after your clients.

### So you avoid the small end which is typically compliance accounting, do not compete with the big four who do much more complex deals with public companies, and instead focus on the middle area?

We are very comfortable in that market and designed our business model on it. We have taken many years to develop and scale, so that we have a brand which services that and is known for it, but it is not for everyone because it needs a strong relationship-based style. Being a commodity with a get them in, get them out strategy will not work for mid-market, nor will a larger business whose brand is attached rather than its people, as the client will get lost. We are very much about that person-to-person style business which we drive really hard.

### How do you differ from a accounting firm with $1 million revenue, in terms of structure, service lines and complexity?

The fundamental difference is our clients are predominantly at $5 million to $500 million revenue businesses and many of them require services which our specialists can provide. Those with a turnover of $1 million probably only have two or three, and the clients want advice quickly. They could be in a complex tax position. We have been at that smaller end without in-house tax capabilities. That requires other accounting firms or lawyers, which then becomes a disjointed process. We see no limits to how big we can get. If the basic relationship processes are in place, it is leverageable across everything we do.

### Can small accountancy firms not serve the needs of those clients?

They cannot service them due to the complexity of tax laws and the requirements of our institute. You can do specific things but not be the generalist all things to all people. Practices have to decide whether they offer specialist services and if so, they need genuine people who can do evaluation and tax advice, otherwise they are left with compliance tax which most people can do. It is hard for smaller practices to offer those services, and a client worth their salt will need that, even if they have $5 million turnover. They will still run into problems where they will need us for the things we can do.

### Kelly+Partners are rolling up smaller $1 to $2 million revenue practices;can they not also centralize the more complex competencies to serve clients as they grow?

I am not sure of their model as to what type of client they are looking to achieve. They are a group of several smaller practices and are more compliance-based than advisory. The difference between working in the S end, not the M end, is really the advisory capability. If you have the advisory or commercial basis, that is where mid-market specialists will revel.

### What do you need to bring in or build internally to offer more advisory services?

There are few people who are capable of holding an advisory role. They are hard to find and a true advisor in the mid-market has a trusted relationship with their clients. You cannot simply clap your hands and make it happen; you need to grow those people. The evolution of SaaS products such as Xero is taking a lot of the compliance away. The tax office in Australia will one day mandate tax compliance in a very basic fashion. Much of the tax might be zipped out of it and you will be based with more business relationship and advisory. We are fortifying our firm for the future as much as the past.

### Will the tax office reduce the need for low end compliance accounting?

Yes, if someone was brave enough to say we will move to a more indirect form of taxation with less complexity, or they might mandate that businesses with turnover of less than $5 million simply pay a percentage of revenue and forget the rest of the rules, because the cost of compliance through people like ourselves is very high. Even personal tax returns are currently a struggle as they are one of the more complex tax returns in Australia which people cannot afford to pay.

### How much does it cost to do a basic compliance tax return for a company with $5 million revenue, either through Kelly+Partners or your firm?

It depends what the client does and what we do. An example is a long-standing client of mine which is three building surveyors who are independently owned. We charged them $8,000 a year to do their business taxation financial statements, and their book keeper cost them $35,000 a year. We were losing money hand over fist because the book keeper was not up to scratch. We were struggling to get the work done and were simply killing ourselves. They were unhappy with us charging them $8,000, we were inevitably finishing the work months after year end and they had no up to date figures.

Five years ago, they moved to Xero to automate processes as much as they could. They have an accountant at their beck and call. We meet on a quarterly basis plus whenever they need on top of that. We changed the frame to give them up to date monthly financials. We do a quarterly director's meeting where we review the results and complete their year-end compliance. For that we charged them $32,000 for the year. We are happy making money, the client is getting proactive work and have control of their business. That is an example, but to answer your question, it is around $10,000 and everyone is unhappy.

### What was their revenue?

Their revenue was $5 million.

### Will it become so expensive that it becomes unmanageable for smaller companies, because $32,000 on $5 million does not seem that crazy?

No, it is not, but we get ancillary work. We look after individuals, offer wealth advisory, sort out occasional tax issues they have, so you can double that figure with the extra work we do for the business. To talk about the race to the bottom or the compliance trap we end up in is the commoditization of that. If we are willing to do it for $8,000 or $10,000, Fred down the road will be more than happy to do it for $5,000. Good luck to Fred who might be good but we are under price pressure and will never meet the market. There is an opportunity for us to convert those clients to a more advisory style. Compliance will always have its part due to major changes to legislation but it is a form of accounting which is older than you.

### Kelly+Partners Group stated there are 15,000 potential acquisition targets in the SME market, which I assume are between $5 to $10 million revenue.

The potential market is significant because public accounting is a mature business and although they are not on every corner, there are pockets of people everywhere. We don't look at it from an opportune perspective; we work with areas with endless opportunities. We try to find the right targets at the right time and have a bank of them to work through. Two weeks ago, we did a merger during lockdown which was all done virtually. They came through an agent who I had been keeping an eye on, and to be honest, I must have looked at several hundred, but they looked slightly different. Over five years, I probably asked the question three other times, but it came up and was strongly suited to potentially merger with us.

### What was different about it?

Their name is BR Wellington and they are small in quantum compared to us. BR stands for business relationships, which immediately got my attention as they try to approach their business similarly to us. They had gone through their client base and decided not to act for clients who did not fit the business relationship style. It was a quick and easy conversation.

### How did you measure or notice they were better at business relationships?

They had a low number of clients to the quantum of fees. Without revealing client names, it was easy to see that they had $1.5 million in fees from only 70 clients. There was quite a pocket of the high end, and they had clearly designed their business around providing the style of client who needs ongoing advice rather than simply chunking out the compliance.

### $1.5 million in fees is a small practice; were they dealing with large clients?

A typical $1.5 million fee client base would usually have one or two larger clients. If you’re getting an assessment, where we leak a lot of productivity is clients who fit in the $3,000 to $8,000 mark which is competitive with others. They only want to get in and out for compliance, and have no other services like wealth advisory, superannuation or taxation. They are the most difficult to deal with because they also want advice without paying for it. BR Wellington moved away from that style of client. They still have a few but they are probably strategic or historic and they would want to hang on to them, but by and large they moved to an advisory practice which is great news for a firm like ours.

### Having many smaller clients who only want the $3,000to $8,000 compliance type work simply sucks out the productivity of your practice?

Yes, not so much the people doing the work but it takes an enormous amount of head space from our senior people, because they want senior partner or manager attention, but cannot pay for it, which takes a large capacity away from us.

### Is this $1.5m acquisition typical of what William Buck looks for?

Our firm wants to build out our specialist services, business advisory function and audit. We have a new corporate advisory person starting on Monday who comes with personal goodwill, clients we hope, and a network. Their specialist services are different. When looking at more tax, business advisory and audit, we will target businesses with one to five partners who might have succession issues. They could have two senior people, a few younger ones and a gap in the middle and they need a soft landing so that the senior people can spend a few years with us and wait for the junior ones to come through.

They could lower their risk by having all the practice and a part of William Buck, but they have soft landed their clients. BR Wellington needed extra services for their clients, but did not want to go down the path we had invested in, in developing our specialist services. Even getting to wealth advisory involves an enormous commitment and cost to get the right people and develop teams and functions to comply with legislation. We would look for that style of target which will have business advisory, but we can then sell our extra services to. We could get a 30% to 40% uplift in revenue from the fees from a single transaction.

### How do valuations for different practices change in the mid-market?

Merging with a business advisory firm, it is a dollar-for-dollar revenue equity base. Our game plan is that the people must come with the clients, because when that happens, you get partners who will underpin the capital cost. It is a swap of clients and equity in William Buck. Sometimes we have to overpay compared to our valuation because smaller accounting practices are more expensive, that is how the market works. Sometimes we will pay up when we believe we can get a 30% to 40% uplift in revenue from being able to cross-service them.

We also get the benefit of reducing their cost because our infrastructure is established across IT, finance, marketing and HR and we still only need one receptionist. Now that we are working from home, it leverages off a greater footprint in your premises so we can squeeze down the fixed costs and you could pick up 10% on fees through our model.

### Why are smaller practices typically more expensive than the larger ones?

It is an easier market if you are a young person and you need a practice, whereas our valuation model is based on an EBIT, times a multiple.

### Are they more profitable the higher EBITDA margin, therefore you pay up?

There is always that reference point and it probably departs around then. Once you get over $10 million it becomes too big for any one person or persons to buy. Would someone risk paying $10 million for a business which does not come with the people? Whereas a person looking to buy a new practice will pay up to get in; it is supply and demand.

### Can we walk through a typical deal? For a practice with $2 million fees, how do you structure a deal with the partners to integrate the practice?

The first thing we look for is that the people come with the clients. No deal will be done with us unless the people come with the clients because it is pointless us buying a bunch of clients who do not know the people. It is a disconnect from our relationship-based model if there are no relationships. It is important the director, partners and senior managers come, and the clients follow them.

You need to ensure those people are looked after and are either given equity or a career plan to be able to stay with us in the longer term. If we like the deal, we will not, within reason, quibble about the price, but will ensure we get what we paid for and that it will work out in the longer term. We will take a two-year view, post completion date, that we will have the ability to review. There could be some at-risk component left out of the capital amount, such as 20% down the track. It could be over one or two years, that there will be an assessment, even with the revenue that is gained and if it has come, an extra 20% will be paid. There is a kicker at the end or an at-risk which can be replaced by new clients but it depends on the value of the deal.

### Do you buy 100% of the equity and practice when purchasing a company?

We buy whatever is coming with that person, yes.

### The roll ups in accountancy and stocks are typically purchased at 100% of the practice and then partners are incentivized with equity in the company, whether listed or unlisted, whereas Kelly+Partners have a 51%/49% model structure?

We want people who are committed to William Buck. Running an integrated practice requires an enormous commitment to a team and a collaborative approach; you cannot simply do half of it. We encourage a team-based approach to business because if we cannot get it immediately, we will struggle later with our growth plans. People are welcome to their business approach but that would not work for our style of client and our approach.

### Back to my example of a $2 million practice with two partners, clearly when selling the practice,it may be succession plan or a liquidation, how do you incentivize a partner when they are technically an employee or partner of William Buck?

We would structure the deal to require that person join the practice as a partner. They may or may not be given equity, but certainly an interest in the business is important in order to hand over clients and relationships if they are indeed part of a succession plan. It takes many years because clients do not simply walk from one person to the next. They need the opportunity to try out a new young gun coming through who may be the next person or they might want to try someone else. Our approach is to give the role of director or partner.

That opportunity to have an annuity or a role for many years afterwards so that the client can see that John is retired and plays golf on Wednesdays, but I can see him on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday if I need to. I know he is there, even though he does not know as much as he used to. I could still leverage off the order we embarked on because it is a safer opportunity for my business. The ability to still be a part of the cut and thrust of business attracts people. They spent their life with their clients and staff being involved in the industry, many of them do not want to walk away but rather work on their terms. It is about giving them a pathway to retirement over a long period to soft land their clients and staff while simultaneously opening up opportunities for their clients.

### What is the average age of a seller for the companies you acquire?

Usually people wait too long; they could be 60 or in their late 50s. If they are still working, like Joe who is in his early 50s, he has other opportunities and we are hoping we can hold him in the practice and show him a new world. We often see that partners of smaller businesses have not got a quality flow of staff through their business. They have been unable to attract people of any great standing into their businesses, so they have no succession plans.

They often hold on too long and end up taking a revenue model and think they will simply parley it from there. The successful ones with good practices become expensive; too much for a $3 million two partner business because young partners lack the funding. We can integrate them into our practice and give time for the younger ones to come through while also offering some of our young people to their clients.

### How do you manage the risk of losing clients when you integrate a practice?

It is very much about having them comfortable and working well in our practice. We have that old statement that if we have happy people, they are doing good work, and if they are doing good work, they are getting good clients. Good clients pay good fees and that whole wheel of progress keeps regenerating itself. We try to have them as happy and aligned to what they want to do, as we do. Because our business model has multiple services, it allows for multiple senior people to get across the client and develop a relationship.

We lamented this in a director's meeting the other week and one of my partners piped up saying he had a relationship with three other partners in the practice, but they had fallen out of love with him, but they had not left the practice. We can get ropes on clients – if they want to leave, they will have multiple reasons why they want to do so – which creates a very sticky client.

### Why do you think companies like Stockford failed?

I am not an expert on Stockford, but my outside perspective was that they wanted to sell their financial services to increase their valuation. I am unsure about the UK but, in Australia, the wealth advisory revenue businesses would be valued at 3.5 to 4 times revenue. They thought if they bought $1 of accounting fees and got $1 of wealth advisory in it, the business would be valued 3 or 4 times higher. It was a leveraged model to try get that bank, and there were all sorts of incentives from larger fund managers for them to do it.

A lot of that is gone now and the valuation has come back slightly, but I guess they alienated themselves from their staff and clients by trying to forcefully sell a bunch of services which they did not need or they hit hurdles in the selling of their services. Clients are smart and realize you have broken their trust. We have an opportunity in our industry to hold and protect that trust and use it for the best interests of the client. I would say that was in the best interests of Stockford's and not the client at the time, but that is total speculation.

### Is that also the case for WHK who similarly sold wealth advisory?

Yes, their game plan was very similar. As I said, it’s important that, when you get the people in, they hold the equity in the business so we are not simply shelling out money for practices. WHK were trade selling practices and would hold people in for a period of time, but eventually they had to get equity funds or debt and if people do not hang around and they cannot get just paid for their efforts, and will walk away. That is what happened with WHK; their best people eventually left because they were getting poached by accounting firms who offered them better business models. Wealth advisory contributed to why they failed.

### Did they not incentivize their partners to stay long enough?

They were giving them equity in a failing business and very few ever got cash. If they got shares and the share price was going down, they would be watching their livelihood go out the back door. Markets are intelligent enough to quickly work that out so people simply stopped going to them.

### After acquiring this $2 million practice, what EBIT margins would you see?

It depends how it is structured. In an equity deal $2 million revenue equates to $2 million of equity in the practice, then we will look for at least 30% return and aim high after that.

### What is the starting EBITDA margin of a practice you acquire? The market average is around 20%.

Smaller practices are often laden with fixed costs which they cannot get out of, so their property costs could be 7% to 8% of their revenue. They could have a practice manager who is no longer required, so we would normally look to at least double what they can return. The extra revenue we could get would be 30% to 40% if it was purely business advisory. That could be quite a lucrative deal to us so we would be looking for a 20% margin on those fees.

### That means you must be able to increase the EBITDA margin from 20% to 30%or 35% or potentially higher for some practices?

For a $2 million practice we need to be able to pay a partner a large sum of money to be able to do that. That is not profit; it is the cost of running those fees. Over and above the cost of that person will be a profit margin, which is what we call profit and will be returned to the directors. We work on a 30% margin after that.

### Pre or post acquisition?

Post acquisition because, unfortunately, a lot of practices perform poorly because of how they carry the cost of the infrastructure and their inability to leverage.

### Is that part of the opportunity you offer?

Yes, and for them.

### Pre-acquisition you have higher fixed cost in labor which you may not need. Once the partners have paid themselves, are they running at a 15%to 20% margin?

Yes, tops.

### Once you enter, you strip out costs and increase the revenue by 30%to 40%?

Once you take out a commercial return, I would be surprised if they got 15%. It is important for us to get that leverage on fees which is obviously very attractive for us to do.

### How do you optimize the working capital of a practice post acquisition?

There are obviously a few models. If they take equity, the capital cost is looked after by the firm. If not, we have to acquire the fees, which means a greater return for us because it all flows straight through, so we will ensure we can pay back the debt in five years. The working capital to support the running of the fees could be 35% of the value of the fees we have locked up in debt as a WIP in cost. That forms part of our banking arrangements and it is important that our people form part of our lock up approach and we run tight WIP and debtors so we do not carry things that we cannot.

### What is your target for lock up?

We aim for 85 days of combined WIP and debtors. We run an insolvency practice which runs it up slightly at times.

### Does that equate to a 50 to 60 debtor day split?

No, the debtor days would be 45 to 50.

### What are the typical debtor days or lock up pre-acquisition and are they quite inefficient smaller practices when they are run by a couple of partners?

Yes, often they will run lines of credit for clients at a length of time, so it is a training exercise to get the clients integrated into a proper approach of paying their debts. Many moons ago it would not be difficult for us to lock up 150 days of debt.

### Kelly+Partners have 54 days of lock up which seems really low, and nine days of WIP which equates to 45 debtor days. How come the WIP is so low?

Advisory work occurs over a period of time, so we need to be clearer on invoicing that work but there is often a start and end to a project. There may be an interim bill in the middle and one at the end. It is hard to bill like the big four, every two weeks and chop it out; it is part of the journey you take with clients. Having said that, the debtor days in our audit practice is substantially lower because they mostly work with corporates. Their lock up debtors and WIP would be 30 to 40 days.

### Does that only work for smaller commoditized compliance type work?

Yes, I am simply projecting on what they will be doing. Some places run militant WIP, but our view is that you have to offer some leeway in order to maximize your worth.

### What is the most efficient you can get your WIP down to?

There is still movement for us and it is as much a billing process as it is anything. A good deal of billing by some people is done at month end. That can be truncated by having a greater commitment to a perennial billing system which requires everyone to be perfunctory with their time sheets and committed at the end of a project by billing immediately, rather than waiting until the end of the month. You could shave off days here and there by truncating that, and our business is getting bigger and so is the commitment to working capital. It is not because we are squeezing down our lock up but that will only go so far, unless you push the fundamentals of how you approach it. You can squeeze the lock up without having to hit your client up any sooner than they are due, so we could embark on some better billing processes.

### Could you not incentivize employees or partners with a bonus of commission if they bill more efficiently?

We have disincentives which inevitably prove to be inefficient and irrelevant. People are happy to wear a cost even if their WIP was buying out, so the most effective way is to be committed to doing good process. If you have good process, people will automatically do it and will not think about whether they were going to get a 10% incentive. That is the last thing they are worried about. Some partners do that routinely, others do not, so it is as much about our commitment to being able to do that and we can squeeze it.

The biggest risk to any lockup is having a tail of old debt and WIP. So the biggest commitment must be to clean that up and do it regardless. It is pointless to keep working with people who are not going to pay and we have considerably reduced and written off bad debt.

### Moving to cross-sell, which services do you sell to existing clients?

For the fundamental business advisory clients who have the mainstream business and the individual compliance associated with that, the best cross-selling elements is through our wealth advisory and superannuation elements. They will also need taxation assistance and structuring advice on buying or selling businesses. We work with clients to get the advisory piece in our business, so that we can even uplift how we interact with a client and add value to how they run their businesses. In addition to the allied services and specialist services, there is also the advisory component in a commercial sense. There could also be due diligence requirements, so there are any number of things we will look to work on with our clients.

### Talking about the wealth management side, in the $2 million practice there is $100 million in superannuation or pension money; how do you leverage that?

The premise of our business is the relationship we have with our clients. We find ourselves in the position where we have the trust of our clients, which needs to be preserved. Our people need to have confidence that if they are introducing another member, even in our own firm, they need to have that trust. I talked about the difficulty of running a team-based business and the trust of me giving you a referral, because you will not do it if compromises your relationship with your client. That is a very strong bond, even internally, so the key is to take that client on that journey, and not simply book a wealth advisor for them.

In a new practice we would usually start off with the top 20 clients. We start with what we call client care plans where we look at our ability to cross-service them into various things and the opportunity to upsell stuff to them. We take the long game on this and it is not something we look to do immediately. Often when we get new acquisitions, people are quite excited and want to start with wins. The energy is quite unusual and exciting from the fact that they can come in and do it themselves if you like, but we try and buddy them up with certain people. The relationship you have with your client is quite unique and special.

You will know your client's risk tolerances. You will know the person you have in wealth advisory or tax will also have different risk tolerances. My client will best be suited to see Rebecca, and you make that call because you can soft land it. The important aspect is to manage that introduction at the right time.

### Do you have IFAs, wealth advisers and financial advisers to serve them?

Yes, when we are in the office, they sit in the middle of the business advisory area.

### So the new practice comes in and the partners would see someone in wealth management, an IFA effectively, who would serve those clients and capture those wealth management fees?

Yes, it is about matching people with people. We have different personalities and approaches but we have very similar or the same compliance approach.

### Are your wealth management fees fixed or variable based on AUM?

They are definitely not a percentage of funds under management. We have always taken a fee for service basis. We normally quote for our services for a period of time and that is charged on a value basis where we think it is worth X and they either agree or not.

### Is it fixed pricing for whatever FUM or service you offer?

Yes, but we charge separately for abnormal work done outside the original scope.

### What is the value of a dollar of FUM of wealth management money? You mentioned it was $3 to $4 historically but that has obviously come down?

Fundamentally, we do because it is the glue that holds a client. We take a client on a journey to achieve their goal, where they have all sorts of accounting and tax audit needs. At the end of the day, they want to reach their goal, but we do not put a value on the difference. Our practice is valued on an EBIT and a multiple perspective.

### It drives higher EBIT due to incremental revenue from wealth management?

It does and if you get over a certain scale, you have them for life.

### How do you avoid the challenges Stockford and WHK had cross-selling wealth advisory? What do you do so differently that you do not fall into that trap?

The fundamental difference is that we are about the client. We are not compelled to sell anything. Our business is 100% about the people and the client. When we talk about the differentials between banks for instance, our banks have been in horrendous positions where they have a bank account so wealth advisory people keep ringing them up asking for their money. It is about the client and what they want to do and we can help facilitate that across a period of time. We have clients who will never use our wealth advisory services and we are happy about that, as long as it achieves their goal.

### What is the biggest challenge getting access to that wealth advisory money? Where do those clients typically have their funds?

The style of client we have include self-made people with strong personalities who think they can do it themselves. The access to markets is very easy and they will choose to back themselves rather than take advice. They may think advice is important, but they will still run off and do it themselves. If a client is good at or amenable to taking advice on several things, they will probably take advice for wealth advisory. The self-made people who want to do it themselves will tend to be more property-based people and blue chip local shares, rather than getting a diversified portfolio across world markets and elements that fit within those.

We talk about getting a regular return which you can be underneath the crazy markets that are currently around, but we will look for an average single digit return and you sleep at night. It will be a balanced portfolio and the market might tank in the US but you have Australian shares and property to support it. Being able to sell that message to clients is one of the biggest challenges. It is more about being able to get that opportunity.

### Looking back on your experience, what is key about serving clients in the mid-market? What are the principles you believe are crucial to certain clients?

The key to serving any client is spending time to understand exactly what they are trying to achieve, rather than having your own agenda. It takes time to get involved and the main way to do that is by creating relationships. Acquiring new mid-market clients does not happen quickly. It could take two to three years to pick up a client and for them to trust you. This is what our firm stands for and these are the things we offer. We may be slightly more expensive, but 20% of the time you will need that and you will wish you had spent that money. It is about having the diversified capability which can be managed across all service lines. I would go back to developing a relationship with a client so you have a proper understanding and have multiple people involved so that you’ve got different perspectives.
