# [[Constellation Software]] Q1 2009 Letter to Shareholders

## TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS 

Our Q1 2009 performance compared well with Q1 2008: revenue was up 32%, Adjusted EBITDA up 64%, and Adjusted Net Income up 51%. Sequential comparisons vs Q4 2008 along with a bit of digging reveal a less rosy picture: revenue down 1%, Adjusted EBITDA down 7%, and Adjusted Net Income down 11%. The drivers of this performance that strike me as worthy of highlighting include our Organic Net Revenue Growth rate (-5%), the Maximus Asset, Justice and Education (“MAJES”) acquisition which was completed in Q3 2008, our increased tax payments, and lastly, the Canadian dollar. 

Organic Net Revenue Growth
Some of our businesses are more subject than others to a downturn in the economy. In Q1 2009, our Private Sector segment Net Revenue contracted 15% organically vs Q1 of 2008, while our Public Sector segment Net Revenue fared better (1% organic growth vs Q1 of 2008) for a combined Organic Net Revenue Growth of -5%. This is the worst Organic Net Revenue Growth that we have produced since we started keeping such records in 2001. Despite the occasional encouraging press release from real estate brokers, bankers and home-builders to the contrary, we have yet to see any clear signs of a recovery in our private sector businesses. There is also little direct evidence of government stimulus spending trickling down to our public sector clients.

MAJES Acquisition

GAAP and even our own “Adjusted EBITDA” measure do a poor job of reflecting the current economics of the MAJES acquisition. In an investor’s shoes, I’d look at the cash purchase price ($35 million disbursed to date) and compare it with the cash produced ($1 million in the 6 months that we’ve owned the business). Not bad, but certainly not up to our long term expectations, and nowhere near as good as the reported six month Adjusted EBITDA ($8 million) and Net Income ($3 million) for these businesses would lead you to believe. There are several large contracts within MAJES that are cash flow negative, and until they are either completed or terminated by the customers, we don’t expect attractive returns from the acquisition. The MAJES acquisition also “helped” our TNA/Net Revenue ratio, contributing to a significant drop in the ratio in Q3 2008 and beyond. MAJES came with significant contract related liabilities but my sense is that the asset intensity of this business will eventually be similar to our other businesses. Excluding the MAJES acquisition, the TNA/Net Revenue ratio was down vs Q1 2008, which suggests that our businesses are continuing to practice conservative revenue recognition. 

Taxes

We have had low tax rates during the last couple of years, but increasing profitability is driving them up. In Q1 2009 we provided for current taxes ($3.1 million) that are more than three times the amount provided for in Q1 2008. Taxes are inevitable, and despite our efforts to minimise them, we anticipate that our ratio of cash taxes to Adjusted Net Income will continue to increase during 2009.


Canadian Dollar 

In the Q4 2008 letter to shareholders I chronicled how the Canadian dollar had affected our profitability during the last 7 years. The gist of the matter, is that with disproportionate expenses in Canadian dollars and revenues in US dollars, we run a fundamental and unhedged foreign exchange position. This hurt us for many years as the Canadian dollar appreciated vs the US dollar, but in the second half of 2008 as the Canadian dollar plummeted by over 20%, we benefited significantly. In Q1 2009 the average Canadian dollar vs US dollar exchange rate was .8054, down from an average rate of .8264 in Q4 2008. Of late the Canadian dollar has strengthened, and should it continue, we can expect leaner profit margins. 

We had comforted ourselves in the last couple of quarters that poor organic growth for Constellation likely meant even worse performance for other vertical market software businesses, and hence we would see a number of good acquisition prospects. This hasn’t proved to be the case. Q1 2009 was a slow acquisition activity quarter for Constellation, with just one acquisition and no new signed letters of intent. Many owner-managers of healthy businesses seem to be waiting out the recession before selling, but I had expected some of the leveraged transactions of the last few years to come unraveled. To date, we have seen very few distressed asset sales. I’m still hopeful that lenders will lose patience with some private equity sponsored vertical market software businesses during the second half of the year culminating in some larger transactions. We are currently negotiating an increase in our credit line so that we can pursue large acquisitions. 

The toughest challenge in the software business is intelligently trading off profitability and organic growth. Many entrepreneurs have a huge bias towards growth at the expense of profits. Most private equity owned software firms have the opposite bias. At Constellation we try to find an optimum position where incremental investment still generates good incremental long term returns. I think our managers and employees are doing a great job of maintaining profitability in a difficult economic environment, without curtailing our record Research & Development spending ($15 million in Q1).

I look forward to seeing those of you who are able to attend our Annual General Meeting on May 7 th, 2009.
