The biggest strength of free markets is to generate and encourage ideas whose popularity [[When what is most effective makes no sense| makes no sense.]]

In planned economies, decisions have to look rational before production even begins, so [[You can never be fired for being logical|nobody is going to risk his career]] by suggesting illogical approaches or products.

On the other hand, free markets will reward what is really useful, regardless of whether it makes sense or not. They allow us to figure out after the fact is something was really a good idea, even if its relevance was not obvious at first sight.


One problem (of many) with Soviet-Style command economies is that they can only work if people know what they want and need, and can define and express their wants adequately. But this is impossible, because not only do people not know what they want, they don't even know why they like the things they buy (see [[Market research is not reliable]] and [[Reason as rationalization]]). The only way you can discover what people really want (their [[Revealed preferences]], in economic parlance) is through seeing what they actually pay for under a variety of different conditions, in a variety of contexts. This requires trial and error - which requires competitive markets and marketing.
