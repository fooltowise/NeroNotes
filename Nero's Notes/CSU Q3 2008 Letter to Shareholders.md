# [[Constellation Software]] Q3 2008 Letter to Shareholders

## TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS 

In a diversified company like ours, you can usually point to some businesses that are stars and some that are not. I’m currently in the happy position of being able to commend the performance of all of our Operating Groups to shareholders. In Q3, some of our businesses recorded double digit organic growth and many of them produced record profits. Others continue to be profitable despite rending and perhaps long term change in their sectors. In aggregate, Constellation generated 7% organic Net Revenue growth in Q3, managed a further 28% acquired Net Revenue growth, produced record Adjusted EBITDA ($15.7 million) and Adjusted Net Income ($12.3 million), and invested more in acquisitions ($44 million) than in any previous quarter. You can’t judge the quality of this quarter’s acquisitions by this quarter’s profit, but after 85 acquisitions over a 13 year period, we seem to have developed a knack for acquiring fundamentally sound businesses at fair prices. While it’s comforting to revel in the Q3 results, I suspect that our Organic Growth will flag in 2009. Forecasters are calling for GNP contraction in North America. Constellation can’t hope to be immune, but we anticipate faring far better than most software companies due to our high and growing (34% growth in Q3) Net Maintenance Revenue.

Another metric worth bringing to your attention in the table below is Tangible Net Assets / Net Revenue. Our Operating Groups did an exceptional job of managing their working capital in an economic environment where many customers are trying to hang on to their cash a little bit longer. This improvement is overshadowed by the large amount of negative Tangible Net Assets that we acquired late in the quarter as a result of the Maximus acquisition. I anticipate that we will not be able to maintain the -84% Tangible Net Assets / Net Revenue ratio in the future, but we should see continued good performance on this metric. A glossary for our quarterly Performance Metrics is appended to this letter. I encourage you to refer back to previous letters for more extensive discussions of each of the metrics.

Because of the uncertainty in credit and equity markets, there are some great VMS investments to be had right now. We scooped up a big one this last quarter in the form of the Maximus assets. It consists of 3 good businesses, two of which came with very large uneconomic contracts. As we indicated when we announced the acquisition, the contingent liabilities associated with these contracts could exceed 50% of the purchase price. Contracts of this size and structure are unusual in our businesses (at least the way we run them). We factored these contracts into the price that we paid for these assets, and if we got it right, these 3 businesses will eventually generate good ROIC’s and contribute to our organic growth. 

Having bought the Maximus assets and 16 other businesses this year, combined with our purchases of publicly traded shares of VMS companies and the pending takeover offer for Gladstone plc, we have deployed and committed approximately $94 million of capital. While we have also had record cash flows and profits, these commitments have largely tapped out our existing line of credit. I am leery about using short term financing for acquisitions, so we are exploring financing options: Either we slow down the pace of acquisitions and live within our cash flow from operations, or we raise long term financing, whether that be equity or debt flavoured. The capital markets are volatile right now, so I wouldn’t hazard a bet as to whether we will find the right investors. If we do, you can expect our acquisition pace in 2009 to continue… if not, it will slow. Irrespective of our acquisition prospects, I continue to be optimistic that our long term performance will be attractive.
