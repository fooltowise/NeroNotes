# Neuro-Associative Conditioning

If you and I want to change your behavior, there is only one effective way to do it: we must link unbearable and immediate sensations of pain to our old behavior, and incredible and immediate sensations of pleasure to a new one.

Neuro-Associative Conditioning will show you in six steps how to create a direct highway out of pain and into pleasure with no disempowering detours.

## Step 1 : Decide what you really want and what's preventing you from having it now.

You'd be surprised how many people came to me for private therapeutic work, and when I asked them what they wanted, they'd spend twenty minutes telling me what they didn't want, or what they no longer wanted to experience. We've got to remember that we get whatever we focus on in life. If we keep focusing on what we don't want, we'll have more of it.

**The first step to creating any change is deciding what you do want so that you have something to move toward.**

The more specific you can be about what you want, the more clarity you will have, and the more power you will command to achieve what you want more rapidly.

We also must learn what's preventing us from making the change is that we link more pain to making a change than to staying where we are. We either have a belief like "If I change, I will have pain", or we fear the unknown that change might bring.

## Step 2: Get Leverage: Associate massive pain to Not Changing Now and Massive Pleasure to the Experience of Changing Now!

**Change is usually not a question of capability, it's almost always a question of motivation. The only way we are going to make a change now is if we create a sense of urgency that's so intense that we're compelled to follow through.**

If we want to create change, then, we have to realize that it's not a question of whether we can do it, but rather whether we will do it. Whether we will do it or not comes down to our level of motivation, which in turns comes down to those twin powers that shape our lives, pain and pleasure (see [[The Force That Shapes Your Life]]).


One of the things that turns virtually anyone around is reaching a **pain threshold.** This means experiencing pain at such an intense level that you know you *must change now* - a point at which your brain says, "I've had it; I can't spend another day, not another moment, living or feeling this way."


A lever is a device that we utilize in order to life or move a tremendous burden we could not otherwise manage. Leverage is absolutely crucial in creating any change, in freeing yourself from behavioral burdens like smoking, drinking, or emotional patterns like feeling depressed, worried, fearful, or inadequate - you name it. Change requires much more than the knowledge that you should change. It's knowing at the deepest emotional and most basic sensory level that you must change. If you've tried many times to make a change and you've failed to do so, this simply means that **the level of pain for failing to change is not intense enough.** You have not reached the threshold, the ultimate leverage.


**The greatest leverage you can create for yourself is the pain that comes from inside, not outside. Knowing that you have failed to live up to your own standards for your life is the ultimate pain.** If we fail to act in accordance with our own standards - with the identity we hold for ourselves - then the chasm between our actions and who we are drives us to make a change.

**One of the strongest forces in the human personality is the drive to preserve the integrity of our own identity.**

To get true leverage, ask yourself **pain-inducing questions:** "What will this cost me if I don't change?" Most of us are too busy estimating the price of change. But what's the price of not changing? "Ultimately what will I miss out in my life if I don't make the shift? What is it already costing me mentally, emotionally, physically, financially, spiritually?" Make the pain of not changing so real to you, so intense, so immediate that you can't put off taking that action any longer.

The second step is to use **pleasure-associating questions** to help you link those positive sensations to the idea of changing. "If I do change, how will that make me feel about myself? What kind of momentum could I create if I change this in my life? What other things could I accomplish if I really made this change today? How will my family and friends feel? How much happier will I be now?"

The key is to get lots of reasons, or better yet, strong enough reasons, why the change should take place immediately, not someday in the future. If you are not driven to make the change now, then you don't really have leverage.


## Step 3: Interrupt the limiting pattern.

The challenge is that most people want a new result, but continue to act in the same way.

Often it's true that interrupting a pattern enough times can change almost anyone. A simple way to breaking a pattern is by **scrambling the sensations** we link to memories. The only reason we're upset  is that we're representing things in a certain way in our minds. Why let the experience continue to affect you? Why not just take this record in your mind and scratch it so many times that you can't experience those feelings anymore?

You've got enough leverage, now scramble the disempowering feelings until they no longer come up.
1. **See the situation in your mind that was bothering you so much.**
2. **Take that same experience and turn it into a cartoon.**
3.  **Now think about the situation that was bothering you, and notice how you feel now.**


As simplistic as it looks, effectively scrambling a situation will work in most cases, even where trauma has been involved. **Why does it work? Because all of our feelings are bases on the images we focus on in our minds and the sounds and sensations we link to those specific images.** As we change the image and sounds, we change how we feel. Conditioning this again and again makes it difficult to get back into the old pattern.

## Step 4: Create a New, Empowering Alternative

This fourth step is absolutely critical to establishing long-term change. In fact, **the failure by most people to find an alternative way of getting out of pain and into the feelings of pleasure is the major reason most people's attempts at change are only temporary.**

If you're not sure how to get yourself out of pain and to feel pleasure as a replacement to your undesirable behavior, **you can simply find the answers by modeling people who have turned things around for themselves.** Find people who have made the lasting changes; I guarantee you'll find that they had an alternative to replace the old behavior.

## Step 5 : Condition the New Pattern until it's Consistent

Conditioning is the way to make sure that a change you create is consistent and lasts long-term. The simplest way to condition something is simply to rehearse it again and again until a neurological way is created.

If you find an empowering alternative, imagine doing it until you see that it can get you out of pain and into pleasure quickly. 

If you rehearse the new, empowering alternative again and again with tremendous emotional intensity, you'll carve out a pathway, and with even more repetition and emotion, it will become a highway to this new way of achieving results, and it will become a part of your habitual behavior. **Remember, your brain can't tell the difference between something you vividly imagine and something you actually experience.**


The next step is to setup a schedule to **reinforce** your new behavior. How can you reward yourself for succeeding? Don't wait until you've gone one year without smoking. When you've gone a day, give yourself a reward! Set up a series of short-term goals, or milestones, and as you reach each one, immediately reward yourself. This way, your nervous system starts to link great pleasure and change.

**The most important thing to remember about conditioning is to reinforce the desired behavior immediately. Conditioning is crucial. This is how we produce consistent results. Once again, remember that any pattern of emotional behavior that is reinforced or rewarded on a consistent basis will become conditioned and automatic. Any pattern that we fail to reinforce will eventually dissipate.**
