# Focus on what endures time

A lot of people confuse knowing the name of something with understanding it.

A good heuristic: Anything effortlessly digested means that your are reading for information, not knowledge. For example, the job of the news media is to inform us about day-to-day events, to entertain us, to reflect the public moods and sentiments of the moment, to print stories that will interest us today and that we will want to read. But that's exactly what creates problems for reader, who often succumb to the recency and availability biases that news creates. The same applies to social media. The feeds we take in are characterized by recency bias. Most of what we consume is less than twenty-four hours old. **Rarely do we stop to ask ourselves questions about what we consume: Is this important? Is this going to stand the test of time for even a year?**


> In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it. â€“ Herbert Simon, *Designing Organizations*


The key lesson is that, in the pursuit of wisdom, we must read much more of what has endured over time (such as history or biographies) than what is ephemeral (such as daily news, social media trends, and the like). Andrew  Ross said: "The smallest bookstore still contains more ideas of worth than have been presented in the entire history of television."
