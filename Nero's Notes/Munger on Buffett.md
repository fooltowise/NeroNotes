# Munger on Buffett

It's hard to believe that he's getting better with each passing year. It won't go on forever, but Warren is actually improving. It's remarkable: most seventy-two-year old men are not improving, but Warren is.

### Charlie's Influence on Warren
I think those authors give me more credit than I deserve. It is true that Warren had a touch of brain block from working with Ben Graham and making a ton of money - it's hard to switch from something that's worked so well. But if [[Charlie Munger]] had never lived, the Buffett record would still be pretty much what it is.

I think there's some mythology in this idea that I've been this great enlightener of Warren. He hasn't needed much enlightenment. But we know more now than five years ago.

### What happens when Buffett's gone?
The key is having good businesses. There's a lot of momentum here. However, I don't think our successors will be as good as Warren at capital allocation.

Berkshire is drowning in money - we have great businesses pounding out money. If the stock went down, Berkshire could buy it back. There's no reason to think it will go to hell in a bucket, and I think there's reason to believe it could go on quite well. I'd be horrified if it isn't bigger and better over time, even after Warren dies. When Warren is gone, the acquisition side of Berkshire will not do as well, but the rest will do well. And the acquisition side will do just fine. In any case, we've guaranteed you that the historical rate of growth will go down, and we wouldn't want to make a liar out of me.

I think the top guy won't be as smart as Warren. But it's silly to complain: "What kind of world is this that gives me [[Warren Buffett]] for forty years, and then some bastard comes along who's worse?"

If anyone would have a reason to worry, it would be me, but having known the Buffett family for decades, I say to you; "Don't worry about it. You should be so lucky."

### What if Charlie dies?
As you can tell, we're planning on immortality here. What do you need - sitting on a pile of money and [[Warren Buffett]] sitting at the parent corporation?

### Charlie as the abominable No-Man
Buffett: You just have to learn how to calibrate his answers. If you ask Charlie something and he says "no", then we put all of our money in it. If he says "that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard", then we make a moderate investment. If you calibrate his answers, you'll get a lot of wisdom.
