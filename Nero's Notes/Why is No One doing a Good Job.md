# Why is No One Doing a Good Job?

Among the best performing stocks of the 1990s were EMC, Dell, PMC Sierra and [[Microsoft]]. These were the cheapest stocks a decade ago, but no value investor owned them. But then again, none of the large growth investors (excluding insiders) owned the shares all the way through the decade either. Why is this? Why weren't value investors, those who claim to be good at pricing a business, invested in Dell in 1990? Why is no one doing a really good job?

No, we weren't invested in Dell either. Worse still, we weren't looking. Although Dell was not expensive at the time, I am sure we would have concluded that its probability of failure over the next decade would have been high, or at least high enough to stop us owning the shares. A study by Michael Goldstein at Empirical Research, a research boutique, claims that the probability of growth stock failure (company growth slowing) is as high as four in five over five years and nine out of ten over ten years. And in the case of Dell, we would have been wrong.

We take no comfort from the fact that not seeing success is a perennial investment mistake: in the 1950s a large Baltimore based fund management company sold their clients' shares in IBM only for the shares to appreciate to the point that the value of the shares sold would become bigger than the whole fund management company itself. What we are trying to do today is avoid the Baltimore company's second mistake, which was to sell an equally big stake in Walmart in the 1970s!

When investors describe themselves as growth or value it might be helpful to have two questions in mind. To the value investor ask, "what is it about your approach that would have stopped you owning K-Mart for much of the last twenty years?" (K-mart was a "cheap" stock, as measured by say price to book value - but a dreadful investment, recent performance notwithstanding). And to the growth investor ask, "what is it about your approach that would have stopped you selling Walmart?"

So how does one avoid these mistakes? The answer lies in analyzing not the effects and outputs of a business, but, digging down to the underlying reality of the company, the engine of its success. That is, one must see an investment not as a static balance sheet but as an evolving, compounding machine.
