# Munger on How to be Happy, Get Rich, and Other Advice

### Tips on How to Be Happy and Successful

If all you succeed in doing in life is getting rich by buying little pieces of paper, it's a failed life. Life is more than being shrewd in wealth accumulation.

A lot of success in life and business comes from knowing what you want to avoid: early death, bad marriage, etc.

Just avoid things like AIDS situations, racing trains to the crossing, and doing cocaine. Develop good mental habits.

Avoid evil, particularly if they're attractive members of the opposite sex.

If your new behavior earns you a little temporary unpopularity with your peer group, then the hell with them.

### Be Satisfied with what you have
Here's one truth that perhaps your typical investment counselor would disagree with: If you're comfortably rich and someone else is getting richer faster than you by, for example, investing in risky stocks, so what?! Someone will always be getting richer faster than you. This is not a tragedy.

Look at Stanley Druckenmiller (who ran one of George Soros' funds, which suffered large losses in speculative tech and biotech stocks): He always had to be the best and couldn't stand that others were beating him by investing in these sectors.
Soros couldn't bear to see others make money in the technology sector without him, and he got killed. It doesn't bother us at all (that others are making money in the tech sector).

### Beware of Envy
The idea that caring that someone is making money faster than you  are is one of the deadly sins. Envy is a really stupid sin because it's the only one you could never possibly have any fun at. There's a lot of pain and no fun. Why would you want to get on that trolley?

### How to Get Rich
A young shareholder asked Charlie how to follow in his footsteps, and Charlie brought down the house by saying:

We get these questions a lot from the enterprising young. It's a very intelligent question: You look at some old guy who's rich and you ask, "How can I become like you, except faster?"

Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Step by step you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. But you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts... Slug it out one inch at a time, day by day. At the end of the day - if you live long enough - most people get what they deserve.

### How to find a Good Spouse
What's the best way to get a good spouse? The best single way is to deserve a good spouse because a good spouse is by definition not nuts.

### The Importance of Reading
In my whole life, I have known no wise people over a broad subject matter area who didn't read all the time - none, zero. You'd be amazed at how much Warren reads - and at how much I read. My children laugh at me. They think I'm a book with a couple of legs sticking out.

I am a biography nut myself. And I think when you're trying to teach the great concepts that work, it helps to tie them into the lives and personalities of the people who developed them. I think you learn economics better if you make Adam Smith your friend. That sounds funny, making friend among the eminent dead, but if you go through life making friends with the eminent dead who had the right ideas, I think it will work better in life and work better in education. It's way better than just being given the basic concepts.

### Reduce Material Needs
Most people will see declining returns due to inflation. One of the great defenses if you're worried about inflation is not to have a lot of silly needs in your life - you don't need a lot of material goods.

### Philanthropy
Warren and I feel that those of us who have been very fortunate have a duty to give back. Whether one gives a lot as one goes along as I do, or a little and then a lot when one dies as Warren does, is a matter of personal preference. I would hate to have people ask me for money all day long. Warren couldn't stand it.

### Avoid Debt
Once you get into debt, it's hell to get out. Don't let credit card debt carry over. You can't get ahead paying eighteen percent.

### The Decline of Public Schools
You could argue that the decline of public schools is one of the major disasters in our lifetime. We took one of the greatest successes in history of the earth and turned it into one of the greatest disasters in the history of the earth.

### Japan's Recession
Anyone has to be flabbergasted by Japan's recession, which has endured for ten years, despite interest rates below one percent. The government is playing all the monetary games, but it's not working. If you had described this situation to Harvard economists, they would have said it's impossible. Yet at the same time, there's an asset bubble in Hong King. *Why? Because Japan and China are two vastly different cultures. The Chinese are gamblers.*

This is a classic example of why, to be a successful investor, one must draw from many disciplines. Imagine an economist standing up at a meeting of economists and giving my explanation. It wouldn't be politically correct! But the tools of economists don't explain what's going on.
