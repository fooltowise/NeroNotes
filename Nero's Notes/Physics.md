# Physics
By doing physics we try to understand our world. The world is made of countless elements that all seem to look and behave differently at first sight. However, physics tries to reduce these differences by looking for similarities in their behavior. It then formulates rules, or *laws*, describing these behaviors. The goal is to *reduce* the number of differences so we understand our world a little bit better.


Physics is done in the context of the *Scientific Method*, which is based on observation, then reason, and then experiment. **Experiments are the sole judges of and idea's validity.**
