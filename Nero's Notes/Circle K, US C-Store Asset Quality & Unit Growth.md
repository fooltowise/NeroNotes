### Can you provide some context to your role and responsibilities at Circle K?

I started out at Circle K, during bankruptcy, back in the early 1990s and came over to help them divest assets that they had closed during the bankruptcy time. I then moved through a property management role and then a director’s role and, eventually, was promoted to the vice president of real estate and construction.

Our primary focus was growing the company and, probably, 80% of our time was spent looking at acquisitions of smaller, mom-and-pop type organizations; 24-store, 50-store, 75-store acquisitions. Then, obviously, participating in the larger acquisitions that came through the investment banking world. We would go out, write the assets, grade them to see what kind of quality they were, help with trying to figure out how much was owned and how much was leased, what the value of those assets were and how they contributed.

There were other teams – such as the operations team– that would go out and look at how the stores were run. We would bring the marketing group in to see what kind of synergies we could get in being able to turn this around. We would get into, how could we make this work? What is our likely competitor on this acquisition? What is the best number we could get and what kind of synergies could we get out of the transaction, to be able to improve, overall?

### Looking at the US market today, Couche-Tard has roughly 5% market share? They have 9,000 stores in North America, 7,000 in the US yet there is still over 150,000 total stores in the US. How do you see the market structure evolving, over the next 10 years?

It’s interesting; you get into the numbers a little bit and most of the data suggests that the majority of the operators are one or two-store operators. That is a bit misleading. When you start peeling back the onion and looking at that, most of those one or two-store operators are tied to a jobber in the local market. That jobber might own 200 or 300 stores but he is just leasing it out to a local operator and then collecting a rent structure, plus a percentage on the fuel. A lot of those are still under local jobbers.

> It is different throughout the markets. In some, you have fairly large jobbers. In Florida, for example, we have one jobber that probably has 800 stores that nobody has ever heard of. There are other operators, like the QuikTrips, the RaceTracs and the EGs of the world that have built regional presence where they have anywhere from 500 to 2,000 stores. Those players are still in the market, as well.

It is interesting to see that a lot of the stuff that is out there, some of it is good and some of it is not so good. You get into the nicer, newer format stores, and you can say that QuikTrip has done a nice job, RaceTrac has done a nice job. Circle K has started to get into that game. When I was there, we probably put 800 or 900 new stores into the market.

### What do you mean by good and not good? How do you define that?

> We usually write the stores as either an A, which would be larger format, big gas presence, large lot, well lit, more modern; or a B store, which is maybe a newer store format, maybe 10 or 15 years ago, where it’s a 3,000 square foot building, with four or five pumps. The new ones would be 5,000 square feet, with eight to 10 pumps. Then you would get a C class, which would probably be the 1970s version, where it’s 2,000 to 2,400 square feet or maybe an under-canopy, with one or two pumps out front.

When we did these acquisitions, the reality was, you would end up with 20% to 25% A-type stores. Probably, the biggest bulk would be in the B-type range and then you would have another good chunk that would be either C or divest type stores. You would get a mixed bag. Some of the older stores can work because you’re in markets that are very difficult to develop, such as LA, New York and Boston, where you don’t have the real estate or the ability to be able to get land to restructure.

### Why don’t you like the smaller formats, the C-type stores?

There is nothing wrong with a C-format store if you are in those type of markets where it’s very difficult and competition can’t come in on you. But if you are sitting there with a C asset, in a Tampa, Florida or a Phoenix, Arizona, where you can get permits within a year or 18 months, and you can go and build a large-format store right down the street, that C store then gets destroyed.

### You lose market share?

Yes, you lose market share and, what happens over time, is you have got to upgrade those assets. You’ve got to flip them. You have got to get rid of all those smaller, older assets, that don’t make sense and replace them with larger, newer format stores, unless you are in those major cities where that is just almost impossible.

### Take a C-type store, in an area where it is relatively easy to get permits – not one of the difficult areas that you mentioned – is there no regulation that prevents RaceTrac or someone building a big-format store, two seconds down the road?

No. That is the challenge. Everybody is going to start to build these big-format stores – at least a lot of the regional players are – and that’s why you have got to be prepared to be able to reposition good locations. You can have a small store, in those kind of markets, that still does extremely well. But if you don’t protect it, by rebuilding or relocating it to a bigger format store, somebody is going to be paying attention and they are going to build right down the street or right across the road and they are going to steal all that volume.

### Then the consumer goes there because it is just a better experience; it’s bigger and more pumps?

Absolutely; it’s a lot, lot better. It’s better lighting; it’s a bigger format store. You have food offerings and you have a lot more things going on. You might have a car wash.

### It’s interesting because, if I remember correctly, in the UK, I think there is some kind of regulation that prevents that, to a certain extent. The government won’t let you just build another station next door.

I think you are right. I haven’t done as much permitting and work over in the UK, other than acquisition work. The other problem in the UK is just availability of land; almost everything is built out.

### What portion of Circle K’s 7,000 stores do you think are A, B and C formats?

> It’s probably 25% A stores, probably around 40ish for Bs and the rest are Cs or Ds.

### Quite a lot of old ones?

Yes. We’ve been doing better on that, over the last 10 to 15 years, by rebuilding and replacing. A big focus, when we first started, was raze and rebuilds because we knew that we had a known quantity there. I’ll give you some examples. We had some older format stores – and I’m going to use Pensacola, Florida as an example – that was a 2,400 square foot store, built in the 70s, had two pumps and averaged about 125,000 store cash flow. We would go in and rebuild that to a 4,000 square foot store, with five or six pumps – maybe seven – and turn that into a store that would make anywhere from $800,000 to $1 million cash flow.

The first focus was on all the raze and rebuilds of that low-hanging fruit, or even some relocations where we had that same store. It might be a block off from the main corner, so you would want to move to that corner to get more traffic. We started by relocating and raze and rebuilding.

We picked off most of that low-hanging fruit, over the last 10 to 12 years. I’m not saying there’s none left, but not as much. We then ramped up more on new stores and added new stores to the mix.

### How much room do you think there is to improve those C stores and get that uplift from 200,000, 300,000 cash flow to 800,000, a million?

> From the studies I did when I was there and what I’m still a firm believer in is, you’ve got to churn your assets; you’ve got to turn them over. You have got to continually replace and rebuild. You might build a new store and have three or four competitors build at the same time and that new store is, maybe, not what you thought it was going to be. But realistically, you’ve got to continually replace stores that are not profitable. For those stores that are not profitable, you’ve got to continually take them out of the market.

Usually, what happens when you take them out of the market is that you sell them to a dealer organization or a jobber, who will lease them. They are still in the system but they’re just not a big performer for you, so it doesn’t make sense, from a company operated standpoint, to continue to operate those lower profitable stores.

### It seems as if Circle K has been doing that over the last few years. The store count hasn’t really moved much at all. In fact, it’s actually declined a bit in the US and they have been selling off stores?

Yes; they’re starting to focus on that same strategy and that is something that I had started, right about the time I was leaving. In the beginning, when they were first growing, they didn’t want to give up store count. They refused to get rid of anything if it was making money. They would get rid of stores that were losing money, but the lower tier stores, they would just hang onto for store count. It just didn’t make sense so, finally, we convinced them that we needed to replace those stores. As we replace more stores, we continue to cut the bottom out of it and they have been doing that.

With declining fuel volume, because of electric vehicles, I don’t know that the store count is going to change significantly over the next 10 years. I think it has the possibility to increase – maybe 1,000 or 1,500 stores – but I think they are going to continue to be churning that bottom level out of the system. Even though you are gaining stores on one end, you are losing stores on the other end so it’s harder to grow store count. What you are growing, though, is profitability. You are getting more profitable because you have got higher tier stores in the market, and you are getting rid of the stuff that it is not producing a whole lot.

### There are 150,000 stores out there. How many do you think are worth acquiring, for Circle K?

> That’s the big question. It depends on the dealers, but some big dealers are investing in their network and they are doing the same thing that Circle K is doing; they are rebuilding the stores that need to be rebuilt; they are getting rid of some of the lower tier stores. That is improving and it probably will continue to improve, over time.

With gas volumes continuing to decline and pressure being put on by electric vehicles – which is only going to continue in the future – I think the first stores to go out of the market are these dealer sites, these smaller, older format stores. We’re starting to see some of it now, where they were doing 500,000, 600,000 gallons of gas and now they are maybe doing 400,000 gallons. Pretty soon, it gets to the point where it’s really not that valuable to run as C-store or gas station, so it converts over to some other use, such as a restaurant. I see pressure on the dealer-owned, dealer-operated sites. I think those are probably the first stores to go, as we see this continuing evolution over to electric vehicles.

### There’s not many of them, I believe? Out of 150,000, is it 5% or 10% max, that are dealer owned?

It might be larger than that. I haven’t looked at that lately, so I don’t really have an accurate number, but that would be something to dig into a little bit. I think there are more than you think because a lot of these, again, are jobbers who own them; some of them are operating and some of them aren’t.

### One thing Circle K mentions is that, if they break down the 150,000 stores, 60% are single-person owned, but you are saying that’s misleading because there are many that are actually owned by the jobbers?

The real estate is owned by the jobbers and then they hire these small mom-and-pop independents, who operate those stores. Say you are going to buy that one or two store operator, you really can’t because it’s owned by a jobber and he’s not going to give you the fuel. He’s just looking for an income stream based off rent and the few cents a gallon he can siphon off the deal.

### What are these jobbers thinking, given the declining gas volumes?

I think some of them are fairly smart businessmen. A lot of them worked for major oil companies. The guy that I referenced here earlier, in Florida, he used to work for Amoco. They know the business and it’s more of an income play. When they are building their new stores, you will see a lot of them building a C-store that they can rent out, then they might put a Dunkin’ Donuts in there and have a franchise; maybe they will put in a car wash. They are looking at all the different income streams and it has been a profitable business for them, through the years.

I think most of them are smart enough and I think what typically happens, as we go through the cycle of these jobbers, is they become ready to retire and they use these assets to sell to the Couche-Tards or EGs of the world, to cash out, take their money and move on.

### Back to this question of how many stores Circle K should or could acquire, you have 7,000 now, 150,000 in total and you mentioned that the dealer-owned ones are going to fall out of the market because they are just not great formats and not well run. How would you approach M&A, today?

They are still going after the one and two store operators. There are still jobbers who have stores in the market where they have a 20 or 30 store base and they are continuing to pick those off, over time. You can see that in their numbers. I can see them easily picking up maybe 20 or 30 stores a year, like that – not counting the larger acquisitions – for the foreseeable future.

They are building around 100 stores a year; that was about the number we were doing when I was there. They tried to increase that but it’s very difficult to do, in the format they are trying to do it in.

### Why is that?

> They have always been very cost conscious. There are a couple of different ways to grow new stores. You can take the Wawa model. Wawa will come into a market and they will hire all the large developers. They will have those large developers go tie up key corners in real estate; they don’t really pay too much attention to how much they’re paying for the site. The developer will purchase the property, permit it, do all the site and they will do that all at the developer’s cost and then they will charge a 7% or 8% return on their overall investment and then they will ground lease it back to Wawa and then Wawa will come in and build the facility.

That ramps up the cost quite a bit. When I was there, a typical Wawas was paying anywhere from $250,000 to $350,000 in ground rent. Circle K wouldn’t do it. They just said, no, we are not going to do that model, so they self-develop. They hire their own real estate team, they go out and source their own real estate. They don’t like paying the high rents so they will try to control the real estate, if possible. If they can’t, they will ground lease it but they won’t pay someone to do all the permitting and roll all that cost into a lease.

Ultimately, what happens is, their development cost gets higher because they are spending more money trying to own the asset and control the cost, and it’s a slower process. You don’t have developers who are out there, in the marketplace, doing this all day long, providing all those benefits. They keep their costs down that way. It’s just a little more of a conservative approach to how to grow and build stores.

### How important is it to own the asset?

It’s becoming harder because there are more people out there controlling the real estate and they only want a ground rent. Whereas before, we wouldn’t even think about doing a ground lease, in the last few years of my tenure, we finally got them to start looking at that. But they wouldn’t pay huge ground rent numbers so we were always in a secondary position to a CBS or Wawa. Now, things have become tighter and they’ve become a little more aggressive, to try to ramp it up a little bit more. It’s a challenge and that’s why, publicly, they’ve stated they want to build 200 stores a year, but they are so conservative in rents and what they will pay and how they look at things that they’ve had a hard time getting past 100.

I don’t see that changing in the makeup of the management team. I know they publicly state they want to do that but I don’t see them doing it; I know how they work and how they think.

### You don’t think Brian or Alain will want to pay that much of a ground rent?

Brian was probably a little more aggressive than the others. Alain Bouchard, who is still involved, was very conservative. Some of the other members of the team are also a bit more conservative. It’s a committee approval. When I was there, I reported directly to Alain Bouchard.

### Is he still involved?

He is still involved, mainly on the major acquisitions. He has pulled back a little bit, in the last couple of years. It used to be just him approving the deals and then, right in my last year, they brought in this committee which includes Brian, the CFO and Alex Miller. Alain is still on that and he had 51% approval rating, on those committees. But from my understanding, he has now backed that off to 49%. He’s still very involved and active, especially on the larger acquisitions and on the development side and he loves real estate. It’s just a passion that he has.

### It is his conservative nature that is defining that approach?

That is how the company was built. They have been very fiscally responsible; they’ve made some pretty wise decisions. They’ve passed on acquisitions when they have got too pricey and given up key markets that they probably needed to be in. I think that has been a little bit of a challenge for them but it has also been very successful.

### Looking at store growth, if they are going to continue to acquire 30, 40, 50 stores a year, from the mom-and-pops, the odd family-run operations, let’s say they build 100 to 130, 140 max, how many do you think they could sell or close down, of the C-type stores?

I know they had a backlog and they did 300 recently. I was actually a consultant for the company that was helping to sell those, a few years ago. NRC got in with them, to do this on an annual basis, going forward. I think the goal is that they will review their portfolio of stores every year, come up with a list and run them through the system to get rid of them. I would say they are probably going to end up with 30 or 40 stores a year that they will divest, once they clear out that backlog, which I think they have started to do and are, now, just about finishing up on.

### Is the only option for Circle K to acquire these mom-and-pop shops?

No; there are still some regional players that are out there. I know there has been a lot of noise, in the news, about EG and that possibility. I was involved in working with the FTC attorneys when we did Holiday and also CST and they had started to become more and more difficult on approving these larger deals. The current administration is a little more aggressive in fighting competition.

I think there are certain markets that they could probably get into but, in other markets, I think they are going to really struggle with the FTC, because of market share. I think there is a limited number of the regional players that they could pick up, but through the Carolinas, it would be very difficult. I think the Northeast is an opportunity; they still don’t have a lot of presence there. Some in the Midwest or out West, in Colorado and there is still some opportunities in California; maybe even Texas.

There are opportunities and there are regional players; EG would be one. That was a good fit because they picked up the Cumberland Farm assets in the Northeast and they picked up all of the Kroger assets, which had a lot of stuff out in the Denver area and up to Ohio and some of those Midwestern markets.

There is Kum & Go out West; there is Casey’s in some of the rural markets, where we didn’t have as much market share. There are some players that are still out there that are fairly sizeable, anywhere from 500, 600, 700 stores to a couple of thousand stores. I think a lot of their focus is still in Europe and Asia.

### On these big acquisition opportunities, putting aside regulation, is it just a case of consolidation and declining fuel volumes will push that? It is going to happen at some point, potentially, if regulation allows it?

Yes, I think so. I think one of the things that fueled a lot of the opportunities earlier, over the last 10 years or so, was low interest rates. Money was cheap so everyone was wanting to borrow and buy stores. They were leveraging the stores, pulling money out of them, buying more stores and they continued to push the price on these things. It was easy money. Everybody was expanding and doing everything they could, with all the cheap money.

Now that money has got a little tight, I think the market is going to change a bit. It is going to be a little bit harder to do acquisitions. You are going to get a lot of these investment groups probably not being as aggressive because the money is higher and it’s more difficult to pull money out.

### There are about 7,000 US stores today; you mentioned they are building about 100, they are buying 30 to 50 and are probably selling a similar amount, so there is net 100 a year. In eight or 10 years’ time that’s another 800 to 1,000 stores, so a total of 8,000. If they do one big acquisition in the next five to 10 years, you can get to 9,000 or 10,000 stores?

> I think that’s fair. I think the 10,000 number is a pretty good number that should be achievable. Obviously, it’s going to take some work and, then again, some of that will be reduced by the 30, 40, 50 stores a year they are going to take out of the market.

### Let’s say a mom-and-pop store, an asset, comes up for sale, for 50 stores. The guys call you and you’ve got to go and walk the asset. What exactly are you looking at, to analyze the quality of it?

Number one, we will look at the quality of the asset, whether it is a big format, newer format store. How is it positioned in the marketplace? Is it in the right location? Where is the competition and what does it look like and where are we placed within that market? Do they have a better store than us? Do we consolidate our store into that store? Does it complement our store? We will do all those analyzes on the real estate and try to value it from that standpoint.

Then we will bring the operations team in. They will go in and do the same thing. They will shop the store, basically. What is the cost of a candy bar? Do they have a good coffee presence? How is their food presence? How can we improve this and that?

Obviously, the big factor that helps Circle K so much is their buying power, on the fuel side and inside the store. You can always pick up some synergies by those two things, plus you usually have duplication of management teams and all of that, that you can take out, as well. People is always a big piece of it.

### With those mom-and-pop businesses, who typically owns the real estate? Do they run the store? Does the family tend to own both, in those situations?

Most of those mom-and-pops, typically, would own the majority of the real estate. I would say it’s probably 60/40 or 70/30, from what we’ve seen in the past. You got into different situations where, when we picked up The Pantry – which was not a mom-and-pop and it was more of a consolidator – they had leveraged everything so most of that whole portfolio was leased. It just depends on the structure and whether that mom-and-pop has grown and how they’ve grown. Do they have resources or do they do sale leasebacks? You get a mixture of everything but most of the older mom-and-pop jobbers that have been around, they usually like to own the real estate, as well. They would control the real estate and then rent it and that is how they would make their money.

### How do you approach valuation of the business?

Valuation is just cash flow. It’s whether you own the real estate or not and what the quality of the real estate is. It is then just a multiple of cash flows. You look at synergies but you don’t really try to value the synergies. Some of the consolidators did value some of the synergies and I’m not saying Couche-Tard didn’t value it but they didn’t like to pay for it. That is how they were so conservative. They would say, we’re going to get all these synergies but that’s what we bring to the table, not what this jobber has brought to the table. They would struggle a bit to pay for some of those synergies whereas some of the other consolidators were willing to pay for some of that.

That is where, in some sense, we got behind the eight ball, as far as, we’re not going to pay for this, but somebody else is willing to, so we draw the line in the sand and they would be willing to wait it out, and rightfully so. We saw some consolidators that would come into the market, pay for the synergies, go belly up and then we would turn around and buy the asset down the road.

### Did EG or these more aggressive consolidators come in and pay nosebleed prices, way more than you would pay?

Yes, absolutely, with EG and 7-Eleven. The 7-Eleven model is quite a bit different from the Circle K model, being a franchise model, so you would see it. They wouldn’t like it; they would prefer that somebody didn’t come in and pay that.

Ultimately, you look at the cash flow. The real estate value, basically, just supported the cash flow. It was all down to a multiple. The multiple would be influenced by the quality of the asset. If you had higher value real estate, you might pay a little bit more premium, to get that quality of asset. If it was less quality, you probably wouldn’t push the multiple as much, for that cash flow, because you know that cash flow is a little bit more at risk, for not having the quality.

### How did you think about the multiples for the different classes, in terms of type A and B stores?

We would look at class A, B and C and then we would put the value on all the real estate there and then they would value the cash flow and see how well the real estate supported the cash flow. If you had 30% or 40% As and 50% Bs and a few Cs, then you would be willing to push that multiple a click or two, because you knew it was a little bit better protected.

### What is the multiple you pay for an A-type store, maximum?

It has changed so much. In the beginning, we were paying five or six and then it got up to eight to 10. I think Holiday was probably 10 or a little north of that. If you look at 7-Eleven and some of the multiples they paid were 12 and 15, for some of the best assets. Holiday was probably about the highest multiple they paid and I think that was close to 10, from what I remember.

### Why did they pay so much?

Just because of the quality of the assets and the markets that we weren’t in. They felt as if there was a lot of reverse engineering that they could do, in terms of improvement on how the stores were operated. They liked their food service offering and, for some of the stuff they were doing, they thought they could take that model and learn from it and roll it out to the Circle K network, to help with all the other stores.

### What is, typically, the fuel gross profit, per gallon, for these mom-and-pop stores? For example, Circle K has gone from a margin of 20 cents a gallon to 40 cents a gallon, over the last five years, which is incredible. What is the case for a mom-and-pop store?

> Again, that depends on whether that mom-and-pop is a dealer that is leasing that space from a jobber? Usually, the jobber is going to skim the profits off the top of that and maybe pay them five or six cents a gallon. The jobber would give up five cents, so he would make the difference. I think what has fundamentally changed is that, when I first got into the business, we were in markets where it was seven, eight, 10 or 12 cents a gallon, in terms of fuel margins. Then it got into the low teens, for a while, and, some years, you would have 17 or 18 cents and then you would be at 13 or 14 cents.

> All of a sudden, things changed. Some of the recessions came through and then you had the EVs starting to hit the market and then costs would rise quite a bit. Some of the historic discounters – such as QuikTrip, RaceTrac and Murphy, who would sell fuel at a really low margin, to try to drive traffic – got in trouble. At one time, RaceTrac got to a point where they were almost cash flow negative because they were so low on fuel margins, that they were almost ready to go under. We looked at them, for a while.

> What I think, fundamentally, happened is, when fuel volumes started declining, EVs started entering the market, and all of these discounters woke up and said, there’s enough margin for all of us to make; we don’t necessarily have to keep things so aggressive and everybody can make money. I think that’s what has happened over the last five years and I see it continuing in the future as costs go up, as fuel volume decreases, margins are going to stay fairly high and I don’t really see them coming down.

### You think it’s really consolidation and the discounters waking up and saying, actually, we don’t need to discount as much and we can all earn decent margins on fuel?

Yes; I think they have to, otherwise they are not going to make money. You’ve got labor costs going up now, you’ve got food costs going up; fuel costs are also going up. With costs going up, and less volume out there to chase, it’s one of two things. You are either going to go out of business or you are going to adjust your margins to be able to pass it through to the consumer and make more money.

### 40 cents per gallon is pretty incredible.

It really is. I talked to some of my colleagues and he was saying the same thing. He feels that the fuel margins are going to continue to go on for quite some time.

### We could see 50, 60, 70 cents in 10 years?

I think so. I think, as the market continues to consolidate, as fuel volume continues to decline, even though the thought now is that fuel volume is probably not going to decline as rapidly as they though it was, I do see pressure put on a lot of these jobbers and dealers and the smaller guys and that will continue to force consolidation into the bigger format stores and companies that can manage them.

### As you said, with the increase in labor, food and operating costs, if the jobbers are skimming five, six, seven cents a gallon themselves, those mom-and-pops are even more under pressure to sell?

Exactly. I know a lot of the independent operators, that I used to deal with, and I still hear from a few of them, and they’re telling me that the business that they’ve made money in, through all their years, is not the C-store any more. They are looking for other opportunities and branching out into other ventures because they see the writing on the wall. I also see it becoming more difficult for some of these jobbers to continue to staff and get the type of people who will be willing to operate their store.

### How do you see the gross profit on fuel or merchandise change after you have acquired the asset, the typical mom-and-pop stores?

Obviously, you get benefits. Couche-Tard can buy fuel a lot cheaper, at two or three cents a gallon less – if not more – than a lot of these smaller players. As they get bigger and bigger, they continue to buy better. They have brought a data analytics team in, to see where they could push margins even further. They are looking at daytime pricing, at lunchtime and different parts of the day.

### Maybe they can afford to pay more. As you said, if they earn 50 cents a gallon on fuel and this mom-and-pop is earning five or 10, maybe they can pay 10 times EBITDA?

Yes. It’s been interesting and the market is evolving. One of the things they started getting involved in recently, was marijuana. They bought a pretty big stake in Fire & Flower and they started playing around and testing that, like they did the EV market in Norway, and now they are looking to expand that model into the US, where marijuana sales have become more legalized.

### I know 70% or 80% of the merchandise is pretty much tobacco and tobacco products, but is there any risk in regulations for the C-stores, at some point in the future, in not being able to sell these products?

I don’t know about regulation. Regulation has always been there. You’ve got declining sales in cigarettes and beer anyway. It is naturally evolving and that is why there is this big push to find other sources of revenue. Most of these companies have gone into food service.

I was reading an article, the other day, where the C-store industry has taken a large chunk of business away from the QSR companies just because the C-stores do a pretty good job on morning breakfast-type offerings, where you can grab a sandwich and a coffee and get your gas and head to work. Or you are coming home and you can grab your beer and maybe a replacement meal to take home. They are always looking for different avenues.

I know one of the big pushes that they’ve been exploring is diesel. I think they think diesel is probably going to transition a little bit slower than gasoline because I don’t think they’ve quite got electric vehicles for semi-trucks figured out, or at least it’s going to take longer for them to work through some of those issues. They are making sure that they’ve got diesel at every location or trying to build sites that have big diesel offerings; not so much a truck stop, but just a fuel stop for local haulers.

Car washes are something else they are looking at. They started doing regular car washes and now they are starting to explore tunnel car washes quite a bit, as part of their sites. I know that’s a big push for them. Lots of different sources of revenue, whether it be marijuana, food service, diesel or car washes, to continue to grow the revenue. The good news is, they’ve got a large number of pretty key locations throughout North America and, as the mix and offerings change, they are always introducing new items into the stores.

### How do you think about the value of a plot? Take a typical forecourt or station, 10 or 20 years ago, the value of it then, based on the fuel consumption and traffic, versus today, given the potential pressure on fuel volumes? How do you look at the value of the real estate?

All you’ve got to do is look at the value of real estate in most of North America right now; it’s just gone through the roof. It has been quite a run for real estate, over the last 10 to 15 years. I see things getting a little difficult now. I talked to some of the developers because I still do some development work and real estate investing myself, and it’s harder and harder to find quality sites. When you do find a site, there is usually a lot of competition for it and the prices are getting pushed really hard. Not only on the real estate, but the construction trades are really high now. With some of the interest rates changing and the housing market slowing down a little bit, that might reverse slightly, but the retailers haven’t yet slowed up during this downturn.

### What is the average multiple, roughly, today, for these plots? Is it eight to 10, or has it come down a bit?

The cap rates on the rents that are going out there are crazy at the moment. They are really low and I’m shocked. I’m still seeing sub-5% cap rate on a lot of these assets that have long-term tenants, long-term quality leases and guarantees. If a Circle K comes to the market now, that is a development deal, it’s going for about 4.35, on the cap rate, with a 15-year lease. It’s quite expensive.

### How does that make sense when the 10 year is at 4%?

I don’t understand why some are doing it. I do get that it has kind of been driven by the 1031 market. People are selling assets and then they have got to place money within a certain time frame, under the law, so they don’t want to pay taxes on that. They will look to replace it with a similar cash flow and roll it over, even though it may only be a 4% or 4.5% return. They look at inflation and the rent bumps, over time, if they hold it long enough.

### Is this for a dealer-owned Circle K, that you own the real estate for?

> Yes. It is paying $200,000 a year in rent and you would divide that by 4.35 and that is what you would pay for it; sub 4.5 return on your money, cash on cash.

### When you were making these acquisitions with Alain, was there a certain cash on cash return that you would aim for?

They always tried to keep the return on capital employed in the 15% range, for the overall company and real estate stuff. On the new store developments, we would look at a blended 12% return on capital. It would be a blended average, over a seven-year term. Typically, when we went back to look at the results, we were averaging 15% or 16% return on our money.

### Let’s talk about Norway, just briefly. Can you just share a bit of context to when you first entered Norway? What was the strategy?

I think the strategy was just to get a foothold in Europe and this provided 2,300 stores, in multiple countries, with a pretty experienced management team in place. That was the main focus. I think the impact of the electric vehicles came a little bit later, a couple of years after we had acquired them. I think it was about getting a foothold in Europe, so we could take that management team and expand it out to other markets, which they ended up doing, by buying assets in Ireland and different markets.

### That EV C-store, that we are now seeing in Norway, how does that compare, in terms of format, to a typical C-store?

They are replacing a lot of the pumps, from what I’ve seen, with electric charging stations. Still having some fuel, but the primary focus is more for the electric vehicles. Whereas in the US markets, we’ve got very few electric vehicle charging stations and you might only have two or three spots for that and then the normal format of gas, out front.

### What is your view on the risk to Circle K, more broadly, over the next 10 years, given this shift to EVs?

Next 10 years, minor. The adaptation to electric vehicles is slow and it’s probably going to get a little bit better, over the next 10 years, with some of the incentives that the Biden administration has put out there. But I don’t see the growth going to the point where it’s going to have a huge impact. What I think is going to offset it is what we talked about with some of the smaller dealer jobber locations going away. I think you will see more consolidation into the bigger format, newer stores. They will hold their fuel volumes or maintain them, or just lose a little bit, and then try to pick up on some of the conversions.

The biggest challenge I see, with the whole electric vehicle offering is how long does it take to really penetrate the market, to get enough market share where it really has much of an impact. I think that is probably 20 years out.

### Excluding any crazy regulation that would cause a Norway-type move. For example, it’s roughly 800,000 to one million annualized sales of EVs in the US today, which is nothing. There are 300 million cars in the US.

And the average ownership of a car is 12 to 15 years.

### Exactly; it’s 12 years.

You do the math; this is going to take a while.

### If you do the math from there, EVs have to grow 45% a year and let’s assume the government phases out all new gas production by 2025. If they don’t put a limit on the age of the cars, by 2030, you could have 100% of all new cars being sold – 17 or 18 million – being EVs, but that is still only going to be 18% penetration?

Yes; very small. I think it’s a 20 to 30 year process to get there. Obviously, electric vehicles have some challenges to overcome, such as range and batteries, but I think they will get there. I just think it’s not going to come quite as quick as everybody anticipates. Norway is a special market. There are only 2.5 million people in Norway.

### Is it even representative of what could happen in the US?

I don’t think so. I think it was good, from a learning standpoint, to see how it impacted the market and what could potentially happen. But again, look at just how small it is, compared to the US and how long it’s going to take for that adaptation. Then you get into some of the rural markets; I can see it taking hold in Los Angeles. I live part time out in Los Angeles and you see a lot more electric vehicles. But still, by far, it’s not the majority of the vehicles out there.

There is another challenge, as well. I bought a Tesla; I own a Tesla right now. I charge it but, you know what, unless I’m travelling any kind of distance, I charge it at home. I don’t go to a gas station to charge it. Home charging is going to be 80% of all those charges.

### Where does that leave Circle K?

Again, it goes back to that question of how long is it going to take to roll over all of these vehicles. I think it’s a 20, 25, 30 year process. Once that happens, it’s going to be slow enough, over time, that I think they will be able to adapt. They will change the format in the stores; they will change their offerings. I think that’s why they started getting into the marijuana stuff and the car washes. People still need their infill shopping for bread and milk and occasional beers.

### Right now, we have 290 million to 200 million gas vehicles, which have a 10 or 12 year life. If they put a limit on all new gas cars produced, in 2025 – and it’s probably likely they will do it at some point – you are still going to end up with 60 million or 70 million less gas vehicles in 10 or 12 years. How do you see fuel gallons consumed changing?

I think the better operators will consolidate most of that volume and will still see significant fuel volumes. I think some of the lesser operators will lose that volume and go out of business, as they get squeezed. Just like anything else, you will consolidate those gallons into few players, and those who are strong will continue to maintain a good chunk of that business and not have as much of an impact.

### What did you get the sense that Alain and the management team were thinking about, in terms of Circle K in 20 or 30 years? When this EV is really penetrated, what do they see all their stores doing?

I think they are still looking to figure that out. I think they are looking at different offerings and they are trying different things. Again, diesel was one play; the car washes are another. Even though you’ve got an electric vehicle, you’ve still got to wash it. I think they see the marijuana becoming more and more commonplace in the US and North America.

### It becomes more like a normal retailer then, rather than focusing on fuel?

Just a normal retailer that still sells time. Time is what they are selling. You don’t want to go into a big grocery store, park a way away and have to walk. Whereas, you can go into a convenience store, get in and get out pretty quickly. That is why they are investing in a lot of the technology to get people in and out of the stores.

### I think there is a stat out there that 70% or 80% of charging is done at home or work, as you said. There is very little in transit so you don’t need 7,000 stores. Or maybe you do need the stores and they’re just going to be stores; no charging.

Most of the stores are along the highway that I see may be benefiting from some of the charging. I just drove my Tesla up through Georgia, probably about a 500 or 600 mile trip. We ended up stopping in areas where there were restaurants and other things, so we could go out and get something to eat, whilst the car was charging. Everything I read about batteries, over the next three to five years, they are going to have the charging time on these batteries down to five to 10 minutes.

Even now, the Tesla app will have you stop, at locations along the way, before you get fully depleted and you will stop for 10 or 15 minutes, to top up, to keep you going.

### Tesla and Circle K are almost competing for that charging market?

Everybody. You’ve got Volkswagen out there, with a $2 billion lawsuit, where they had to roll out so many. You’ve got all the different companies competing. Part of the challenge with all of these charging stations is you’ve got the slow chargers, the fast chargers; that whole side of the business is changing pretty rapidly, as well. You’ve got all these different adapters; what fits in this car or that car? That has not really sorted itself out either. I see some consolidation in that industry, as well. Is it going to be Tesla charger? Is it going to be a different type of charger? There are probably going to be one or two that are going to dominate and they will get to more standardized plugs, instead of everybody having their own plug, just like the Apple phone.

### That is what Circle K are now doing in Norway. They have some home charging and business charging product, but that is a completely different business from what they are doing now. They are a real estate and retail business. Do you see them actually doing that in 20 years’ time, being a charging company?

I know they are trying to get into that and I think that’s just another thing that they are exploring. Couche-Tard is pretty good about testing different things and seeing if they can get into the home charging network and the battery. I think Tesla and some of the other companies are so far ahead of them in that area that it’s going to be hard for them to compete or have a quality name that says, I want to buy a Circle K charger for my home, as opposed to a Tesla charger. I don’t see that as a long-term solution. Maybe it will work in some niche markets.

### Worst case scenario, they will have to repurpose the real estate on the highway and use it for something else?

Yes; just a different use. Or sell it off.

### What is the worst case scenario, in your mind, of the biggest risk to Circle K, in this transition to EV?

Obviously, electric vehicles do pose a problem. Again, I think it’s going to be long enough and far enough out there that they will be able to transition into other things. As we continue to evolve, you are now getting into driverless cars, even flying vehicles; they’re a little futuristic, but they’re starting to produce those cars. If they can get the cost down, the batteries down, are people going to be flying in their personal hovercraft?

I probably see the challenge as electric vehicles but it’s a pretty sharp management team. They have been pretty good about staying ahead of the trends and being conservative enough where they don’t put themselves at too much risk. I think they will be able to navigate it.

### But it’s a risk?

Yes, it’s a risk. Is it 10 years? Is it 20 years? Is it 30 years? My gut feel is that it’s 20 to 25 years, before it has a super impact on the business.
