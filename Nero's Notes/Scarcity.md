# Scarcity

## 4 types of Scarcity in [[Copywriting]]

1. **Price scarcity:** the good old fashioned time-limited discount. You need to have a reason for the limited-time discount. Ex: early bird reason, or seasonal offer.
2. **Quantity Scarcity:** works very well with physical products, or human services like coaching. You also need a good reason 
3. **Premium scarcity:** you can always use scarcity by offering limited-time bonuses. The goal here is to temporarily upgrade the value of your offer by including premium products or content along with the main sale.
4. **Offer scarcity:** when you are launching or re-launching your offer for a limited time, after which it will be completely unavailable.


This can also be used in combination: 
*You only have three days left to get your hands on this product at 50% off, along with your 5 free bonuses. After that it will be put back in the vault until this time next year. And when we do release it again, it will be at a higher price and the bonuses will be gone.* => Price, premium and offer scarcity.
