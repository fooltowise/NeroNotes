Evolutionary psychology explains that we do not have full access to the reasons behind our decision-making because, in evolutionary terms, we are better off not knowing. We have evolved to to deceive ourselves, in order to be better at deceiving others. ("*I bought you these flowers in the desperate hope that you would sleep with me.*")

[[Evolution - Natural Selection and Extinction| Evolution]] does not care about objectivity - it only cares about fitness. If it helps to perceive the world in a distorded fashion, then evolution will limit our objectivity.
