# Nomad's Performance Fee

Currently the partnership pays a performance fee to the investment manager if compounded performance, since subscription, exceeds a 6% per annum hurdle. our proxy for long term deposit rates. The fee earned is one fifth (or 20%) of all investment gains in such a year.

Although a huge improvement on the industry standard fee structure that fails to assign any cost to investors' capital, the flaw here is easy to spot. We take a great deal of care stressing that Nomad is an investment only suitable for partners with time frames in excess of five years, matching our average stock holding period. At the same time, your manager is taking an annual fee, a clear mismatch  in the duration of rewards. And what of periods of poor performance? Up to now Nomad has adopted the industry standard "high water mark", which solely avoids double charging investors for the same performance... this "heads-I-win, tails-I-don't-lose" construct is, to our mind, clearly inequitable. But there's little out there that improves on this.


Our solution to this quandary (our special thanks to our friends at Orbis in Bermuda who have trail-blazed this path) involves some Heath-Robertson-like innovation, something we like to call a performance fee bucket or, what our lawyers more elegantly term, a "contingent performance reserve" (CPR).

What we propose is that  each year a 20% contingent performance fee is charged on investment gains in excess of 6% (after the management fee) achieved that year. Unlike previously, that's not 6% compounded  since subscription, it's a more demanding 6% bogie each year. And, more importantly, this fee is not paid directly to Sleep Zakaria and Co at the year end. Instead, it is paid into a reserve account, the CPR, the running balance of which is available to refund to partners in subsequent years when performance falls short of the 6% hurdle. So, tails we lose and rightly so. to recap, the bucket fills and empties as our investment performance exceeds or falls short of the 6% annual hurdle. So, if Nick and I do a decent job investing, over time, the money flowing into the CPR will exceed that flowing out in refunds, and a positive balance will be created.

The next stage to consider is how the CPR is distributed to our company. What we propose is that SZ and Co is paid, from the bucket, 20% of its running balance each year (on a declining balance basis). This places the performance fees you pay into the CRP at risk of refund for subsequent sub-hurdle performance for, on average, five years. This aligns the duration of our rewards with yours. The picture below illustrates the dynamics.
