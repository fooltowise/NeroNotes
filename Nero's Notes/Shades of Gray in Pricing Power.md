Pricing power can reflect the comparative perceived benefit of a product versus the next best alternative. However, the question is more often one of competitive structure rather than product type, as pricing power is typically held by monopolies or a [[Mini Monopolies]].

Indeed, many companies that have some degree of pricing power prefer not to discuss it due to its close association with monopolies. These companies are aware that the less that is known about pricing by customers, potential competitors and regulators, the better. A common way for companies to package the topic is to speak about price increases and feature enhancement at the same time, which tends to create less fuss with customers when higher bills arrive. In any event, as already discussed, the exercise of pricing power should be manifested in stable high gross margins as well as incremental periodic expansion in gross margins. 

Pricing power derived from a standard monopoly structure is easy to spot, particularly if large or traditional. The most exquisite historical example, though now outdated thanks to the internet, was the only newspaper in town. While such classic monopolies do exist, companies with pricing power otherwise vary widely in their businesses characteristics. One feature, however, is [[Brands]] power, of which [[Hermes]] is the perfect example.
