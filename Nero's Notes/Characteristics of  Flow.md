# Characteristics of Flow

Flow experiences display eight major characteristics:
1. The task is doable but is challenging and requires a particular skill.
2. The individual is focusing on what he is doing.
3. The targeted goal is clear.
4. The activity provides an immediate feedback.
5. The individual is engaged, and any distraction disappears.
6. The individual has control on his actions.
7. Self-awareness disappears, but paradoxically self-perception is reinforced after the flow experience.
8. Time perception is altered.
