> Let all your efforts be directed to something, **let it keep that end in view**. It's not activity that disturbs people, but false conceptions of things that drive them mad. Seneca, _On the tranquility of mind_

Having an end in mind is no guarantee that you will reach it (no Stoic would tolerate this assumption), but _not_ having an end in mind is a guarantee you won't. 
When you efforts are not directed at a cause or a purpose, how will you know what to do day in and day out?
**How will you know what to say no to and what to say yes to?**
How will you know when you've had enough, when you've reached your goal, when you've gotten off track, if you've never defined what those things are?
