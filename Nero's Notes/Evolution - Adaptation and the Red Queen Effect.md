Organisms constantly adapt to their environments to gain a [[Competitive Advantage]]. An organism unwilling to adapt is bound to disappear. 

This leads to the expenditure of massive resources just to stay at the same place. Complacency will kill you. The stronger we are relative to others, the less we are willing to change. 

We see strength as an immediate advantage that we don't want to compromise. However, it is not strength that survives but adaptability.
