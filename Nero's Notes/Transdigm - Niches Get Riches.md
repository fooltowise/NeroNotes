# [[Transdigm]] - Niches get riches

by [[Scuttleblurb]]

In the Spring 2019 issue of [_Graham and Doddsville_](https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/valueinvesting/sites/valueinvesting/files/Graham%20%26%20Doddsville_Issue%2036_vF.pdf), John Hempton was quoted as saying:

_“In my case, \[I usually want to own\] a company that makes a widget that is a small yet important part of a bigger thing, has high switching costs, and has incrementally improved over time. I call this the trifecta. There´s an old saying for this: ´There are riches in niches.´”_

TransDigm reflects at least two parts of this trifecta.  Over its 26 year history, this company has spun riches out of essential but nondescript aircraft components: valves, pumps, audio systems, latches, hinges, locking devices, engine sensors, bathroom faucets, passenger seat belts, and of other parts that help power aircraft, secure passengers, lock cabin doors, and reinforce airframes.  It sells lots and lots of these low-dollar value parts at low/mid-teens EBITDA margins to aircraft manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus and realizes hefty ~70% margins charging airline operators and US/US-friendly governments for spare parts over the 30 year life of an aircraft (60% of TDG’s total revenue is commercial; 35% defense). 

Around 90% of TransDigm’s revenue comes from parts for which it owns the IP, which means that in most cases it is awarded the aftermarket revenue streams, and around 80% is derived from parts for which it is the only manufacturer in the world.  As a manufacturer of proprietary, sole-sourced parts, TransDigm has also been largely insulated from the onerous cost containment measures of OEMs, who over the last 5 years have been insourcing components, claiming more aftermarket revenue, and pressuring their supply chains (Boeing’s “Partnering for Success” initiative has been dubbed “Pilfering from Suppliers” by cynical vendors).  They have extracted concessions from “make-to-print” manufacturers with non-proprietary products like Spirit Aerosystems(1) – which builds according to Boeing’s IP and whose pricing negotiations with Boeing have been in part responsible for its escalating forward loss reserves – but have left proprietary manufacturers alone for now. 

TransDigm commits engineering and R&D resources upfront for several years, developing new products before revenue has been committed, but these investments typically go towards continuously improving reliability, weight, and features rather than conjuring ground-breaking innovations with uncertain payoffs.  Moreover, new product development is typically catalyzed by inbound requests from OEM customers, each of whom has an internal sponsor advocating on behalf of TransDigm to ensure product acceptance.  Once an OEM selects a parts supplier for an airframe program and the FAA has approved the plane and the bill of material suppliers, then absent some major screw up, the supplier’s part is deeply embedded in the airframe’s design and can only be extracted at great cost.  And, unlike an engine manufacturer like Rolls Royce, who loses money upfront on every engine it sells, TransDigm generates profits on parts sales to OEMs, who will use the same airframe design for ~30 years. 

After the OEM has sold the aircraft to an airline, TransDigm enjoys _yet another_, juicier stream of profits.  TransDigm gets away with what seem like extortionary aftermarket margins because its parts are critical to a plane’s operation yet comprise a small enough portion of maintenance costs that it avoids scrutiny.  According to management, the global airline industry incurs operating expenses of around $700bn.  $70bn of that is maintenance, of which $30bn is spare parts and components.  TransDigm’s ~$2bn in commercial aftermarket revenue amounts to less than 10% of that. 

No single component is centrally important to TransDigm nor costly enough to matter to an airline.  Only 10% of TDG’s aftermarket revenue comes from parts that generate more than $2mn in revenue, so across the top 20 carriers that make up half the airline market, each spends, on average, maybe $50k/year ($2mn/2 divided into 20) on TransDigm’s highest volume sellers compared to $1bn to $2bn of annual maintenance outlays.  The ~thousand bucks that an airline operator spends on an average TransDigm part is just not material enough to worry about.  Of far greater concern is having to ground an airplane for an extra day and forgoing revenue on a large fixed cost base because, I dunno, the valve on a fuel system pump is defective or in short supply.  So long as these critical components always work and are delivered on time, there is little reason for an airline to swap suppliers.         

The lifetime returns that TransDigm realizes on an airframe program are pretty stunning.  TransDigm invests upfront in engineering and manufacturing for 3-7 years, but then realizes profits for up to 60 years: an OEM uses the same airframe design for ~30 years and each plane manufactured according to that design has useful life of ~30 years.  TransDigm generates profits on the parts sold to the OEM to make those planes and then realizes even fatter profits when that plane gets put into service by the airline, who will need to purchase replacement parts and spares over that plane’s ~30-year life.

The profit profile looks something like this:

![](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pic1.png)

While aftermarket accounts for ~60% of revenue, it is closer to 85%-90% of TransDigm’s EBITDA.

The cumulative research, design, and development investments borne in the first 5 years are negligible relative to the cash flows that follow.  The sum of the cash flows in just the initial 5-year period starting in year five, right when OE production starts but before aftermarket revenue streams are anywhere near maturity, already exceeds the upfront investment by nearly 7x.

Compare that to the cash flow profile of a jet engine manufacturer.  Below is an exhibit from Rolls Royce’s 2018 Investor Day, which profiles the lifetime cash flows of a 2,000-widebody engine program.

![](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pic2.png)

Not only does Rolls face substantial one-time up-front development costs, but unlike TransDigm, it loses money on every engine it ships to the OE (or breaks even at best).  Even baking in the savings that Rolls has yet to realize on its OE engines, aftermarket cash flows over the subsequent 25 years that an engine is in service amount to just 4x the cumulative upfront investment.  Moreover, for Rolls Royce to maintain relevance in a highly competitive duopoly, those cash flows must be reinvested in risky, cutting edge projects.  Finally, the baroque complexity of engine manufacturing, with all its suppliers and component parts and steps, exposes the engine manufacturer to cost overruns.  In other words, compared to TransDigm, engine manufacturers take on far more risk for lower returns. 

TransDigm enjoys a reliable stream of cash flows throughout an airframe’s lifetime because its proprietary, sole-sourced products are embedded in OEM airframe programs and are too cheap relative to overall maintenance costs for an airline operator to concern itself with.  But the very same characteristics that make its products so sticky also make it difficult steal share from competitors that also have high-IP, sole-sourced products.  TransDigm must buy them instead.

Since its founding in 1993, TransDigm has acquired close to 70 companies.  But the number of acquisitions belies the discernment applied to each one.  For instance, in 2017, the company looked at over 300 companies, vetted 26 that met its criteria, and closed on 3.  In business school, I took a corporate finance class where the professor averred that the only (and I mean the _only_) possible source of value from a merger came from cost and revenue synergies.  His main objective in making this point with such adamance was to shoo away frequently sited but nonsensical reasons to merge (namely, buying diversification and growth). 

But giving credence only to cold, hard synergies suggests that there is a single effective integration model, one that centralizes back end functions, finds commonalities among products to eliminate duplicative sales and support, cross-sells through a common salesforce, consolidates buying to achieve better terms from suppliers, and so on.  And yet, there are counter examples of successful acquisitive companies who explicitly forego scale economies by incorporating acquisitions into a highly decentralized structure.  I’ve written about two, Brown & Brown and [Constellation Software](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/csu/), in prior posts.  HEICO, the subject of a future post, is another example.  And then there’s TransDigm.  TransDigm’s org chart decomposes into 5 executive VPs, who carry the company’s culture of sales productivity and cost discipline down to 5 to 7 operating units, each functioning as an autonomous unit staffed by a few hundred people generating between $50mn to $200mn in revenue.  Each operating unit is in turn composed of 2 to 4 _business units_ that are each organized around related products or engineering design and that stay close to the customer(2).  In 2016, back when TransDigm was doing over $3bn in revenue, its corporate office was staffed with just 25-30 people, about which founder Nick Howley remarked “I know it’s unpleasant, but it’s necessary”.    

To be clear, there is nothing intrinsically superior about a decentralized org structure.  In the absence of central oversight, one can imagine costs and unproductive projects running amok as each atomized unit acts according its own idiosyncratic interests.  In fact, I surmise that decentralization only works in the service of value creation when it is paired with strong cultural norms and incentive structures that instill an ownership mentality.  At TransDigm, each business unit manager has full responsibility over his own P&L.  All senior managers at the operating units are paid below industry-average base salaries and earn their keep through equity options that vest according to performance, not time. 

Executive officers are subject to minimum stock ownership requirements – the Executive Chairman must own at last $10mn; the CEO at least $6mn – and are also compensated primarily through options whose vesting schedules are pegged to growth in per share intrinsic value.  Directors and officers collectively own 11% of the company’s shares.  From its inception in 1993 to last year, TransDigm was run by its founder Nick Howley, who continues to stay involved as Executive Chairman.  Three-quarters of leadership positions are occupied by internal promotes, ensuring cultural continuity. 

And what is that culture?  In TransDigm’s case, it is clinically, pitilessly generating profitable sales and controlling costs.  Each year, every business unit holds specific people accountable for procurement, labor, and discretionary spend reductions that are significant enough to offset expected cost inflation.  Sales volumes per head are tracked for year-over-year improvement.  Within the first month of closing an acquisition, TransDigm will get all up in there, cutting overhead, jettisoning dead weight from the employee roster, terminating unproductive pet projects, outsourcing services and extracting procurement savings, whittling working capital, streamlining manufacturing productivity, and so on.    

After securing all the nuts and bolts and making sure the right people are in the right places, the company will take a keen look at aftermarket contracts and start aggressively hiking prices.

You can see how this tact towards value creation might be perceived as controversial and seized by short sellers as justification to short the stock.

In a January 2017 report subtly titled “Could TransDigm be the Valeant of the Aerospace Industry?”, Citron Research, with characteristic balance and poise, writes:

![](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pic3.png)

Later in the report, Citron provides a few examples of these egregious post-acquisition price hikes:

![](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pic4.png)

Citron raises some valid points.  The parallels between Valeant and TransDigm should not be dismissed out of hand: both companies assume significant amounts of debt to roll up smaller competitors.  TransDigm does indeed fire employees and raise prices on acquired products.  It spends very little on R&D.  But the problem with sensational, agenda-oriented research written in bad faith (long or short) is that it’s hard to know how seriously to take its claims.  For instance, in the table above, why did Citron isolate these 5 products out of the hundreds of thousands of TransDigm aftermarket parts? 

Below is the central exhibit from the Capitol Forum report that Citron references:

![](https://mk0scuttleblurbyijo5.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pic5-1024x384.png)

Across a wider sample size of parts, TransDigm’s price hikes, while still substantial, are far less extreme than the cherry-picked examples cited by Citron.  While most researchers might exclude outliers to discover a generalizable truth, as CF has done in the bottom half of the table, it seems that Citron has done the opposite, considering only the most extreme data points to support an agenda. 

In the years leading up to its collapse, Valeant’s organic growth was somewhere between 10%-15%, with a little more than half of that coming from price.  And yet, we know that for at least a handful of acquired therapeutics, the company was lifting prices by 3x to 5x within the span of a year(3).  It seems that the extreme price hikes for a handful of drugs were diluted by more modest price hikes for the other ~1,700 drugs Valeant had in its portfolio.

In TransDigm’s case, commercial aftermarket revenue has grown by ~8%-9% organically since fy11.  If we assume that aftermarket volumes track the growth of industry revenue passenger miles (RPM) over this period, then we might deduce that 3%-4% of TransDigm’s organic growth has come from pricing.  But this understates the value that TransDigm is really extracting from its customers since, as with Valeant, immediate price hikes on a subset of products are buried underneath more modest annual price hikes on tens of thousands of other parts, parts that in the distant past experienced similar dramatic, one-time price hikes of their own. 

Even so, on the commercial side of TransDigm’s business, Valeant comparisons fall short.  It is one thing to push double-digit pricing on parts that comprise a tiny, barely noticeable fraction of an airline’s maintenance costs and quite another to do so on life saving therapeutics that most Americans have a hard enough time paying for as it is.  It’s not just the economic burden placed on the customer, but the ire that the latter provokes among the American electorate at a time when healthcare costs are under such keen scrutiny.  A pharmaceutical company that [raises the price of a 1ml vial of heart rhythm medication from ~$200 to ~$1,200 overnight](https://www.wsj.com/articles/valeant-turing-boosted-drug-prices-to-fuel-preset-profits-1454445342) elicits a far stronger reaction from the media and from voters than an airline parts supplier that lifts the price of a fuel system pump valve by a similar proportion (if such a thing is even happening at all). 

But TransDigm has not escaped the scrutiny of its government customers, who make up 35% of revenue.  The Department of Defense Inspector General had this to say in its February 2019 report, “[Review of Parts Purchased from TransDigm Group](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Feb/27/2002093709/-1/-1/1/DODIG-2019-060.PDF)”:  

_“We determined that TransDigm earned excess profit on 46 of 47 parts purchased by the DLA and the Army, even though contracting officers followed the FAR and Defense Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) allowed procedures when they determined that prices were fair and reasonable for the 47 parts at the time of contract award. When we compared the awarded prices for the 47 parts on 113 contracts to TransDigm’s uncertified cost data, our analysis determined that only one part purchased under one contract was awarded with a reasonable profit of 11 percent(4)”…_

 _**“We recommend that the DLA and the Army consider all available corrective actions with TransDigm, including but not limited to, directing contracting officers to seek a voluntary refund from TransDigm for excess profits identified in this report”**._    

(bolding mine)

But the thing is, TransDigm has been subject to regular Inspector General reviews since at least 2002.  These reports go on about how the government is getting hosed on pricing, and yet nothing seems to come of the matter.  I’m not sure if the DoD is just posturing to keep TransDigm in check on the next round of contract negotiations or laying earnest claim to price rollbacks or what.  What I know is that TransDigm and the US government have been locked in this tango since the early 2000s, to no discernable effect.  HEICO, a supplier of “generic” PMA parts to the Defense Department likewise noted in its May earnings call that “it’s an interesting paradox in that the DOD doesn’t like the high prices that some people charge them, yet when it comes to approving alternate sources, it’s very difficult for them to commit the resources to be able to go ahead and do that”.

So then, Citron gets to the crux of the matter:

![](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pic6.png)

(highlighting mine)

This is a real head scratcher.  Here is a plot of TransDigm’s organic growth going back to FY 2008 (ending September):

![](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pic7.png)

TransDigm’s organic growth has been well below 10%/year over the last decade.  Unless you think the company’s organic volumes have been declining over a period where RPMs have been growing ~4%-5%/year (there is zero reason to believe this is the case), I don’t see how Citron’s claim can be true. 

Another concern, one that Citron didn’t mention in its report, is aftermarket competition from third party “generic” Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA) parts, which are deemed by the FAA as being of equal quality to the originals but are priced at significant discounts. 

But the PMA approval process is expensive and time consuming, requiring sign-off from both the FAA and airlines.  According to management, it is generally not worth pursuing for parts with price points below $5k, which account for 90% of Trandigm’s aftermarket commercial revenue.  Also, the time it takes for an airline bureaucracy to sign-off on a new PMA part constrains supply.  Over the last 5 years, TransDigm has introduced, on average, 20,000 new parts into the aftermarket per year.  Less than 1% of them, 130/year, have third-party PMA alternatives.  Third party PMA and surplus parts have been a mild source of recurring angst for TransDigm’s shareholders over the last decade, but the fact of the matter is that they overlap with less than 2% (and falling) of TransDigm’s commercial aftermarket business and have had negligible impact on the company(5).   

If you can get comfortable that pricing won’t get rolled back and that the company’s competitive position is secure form generic alternatives, then I think you can come to terms with TransDigm’s financial leverage. 

Since the beginning of FY 2008, TransDigm has generated $5.3bn of free cash flow.  During that period, it has spent $11.2bn on acquisitions and $7.3bn on special dividends(6) and share repurchases.  The difference has been funded with debt.  Lots and lots of debt:

![](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pic8.png)

TransDigm has a history of levering up to make acquisitions or pay special dividends and de-levering in subsequent 2-3 years before re-levering once again:

![](https://mk0scuttleblurbyijo5.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pic9-1024x559.png)

I think the perils of financial leverage are well understood.  A company with maddeningly cyclical cash flows, treading water in a secularly declining market is obviously in no position to support 4+ turns of debt.  But TransDigm is not that.  It sells critical products with few viable alternatives, affording it pricing power.  It is assiduous about sales productivity and cost discipline.  Its aftermarket revenue, responsible for 90% of EBITDA, is tied to revenue passenger miles, which over the last 20 years have grown by ~4%-5%/year with little variability outside the 9/11 terrorist attack (in 2009, the company endured a mere 2% decline in organic revenue, while growing its EBITDA dollars and expanding its margins).  Capex is less than 2% of revenue; 40%-50% of EBITDA converts into free cash flow; EBITDA covers interest expense by 3.5x.  TransDigm’s maturities are responsibly laddered, with 70% coming due in 2024 or later.  TransDigm has a shitload of debt, but I think they can handle it.

Given the durability of its business and the stability of its end markets, TransDigm would be doing its shareholders a disservice by eschewing debt for the sake of undue conservatism.  Financial engineering, despite its icky connotations, can be a lever for equity value creation.  Management often refers to itself as a publicly traded private equity shop and true to form, it will buy companies for between 9x and 12x EBITDA, funding ~60% of the purchase price with debt, and implement operational changes (cost cuts, price hikes, etc.) to ~double EBITDA over the next 5 years…so, a mid-teens unlevered return assuming no change in the multiple (across rolling 5 and 7 year period from starting in 2011 and 2013, respectively, I calculate 20% pre-tax unlevered cash returns on incremental capital, so the math seems to check out(7)). But, be aware that doubling acquired EBITDA over 5 years is ~half predicated on the company’s ability to hike prices. 

Assuming a purchase price of 10x EBITDA, funded with $1.5 of debt for every $1 of equity, the equity annualizes at a high-20s rate (3.5x the initial equity investment).  With a thousand or so aerospace parts suppliers out there, there is plenty of acquisition runway left.  The 40%-50% of EBITDA that drops down to free cash flow gets levered up to buy more companies at high-20s IRR, and so on. 

And, whaddayaknow, TDG stock has compounded by high-20s over the last decade. 

![](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pic10.png)

TransDigm’s senior managers are explicitly incented to achieve these results.  They are compensated predominantly with options and those options fully vest only if the annual growth in TransDigm’s intrinsic value per share exceeds 17.5% (“at or above the long-term returns of top performing private equity funds”, per the Proxy)(8).

A quick digression. This company is very easy to hate.  While TransDigm isn’t doing anything illegal (as far as I know), its blatant financial engineering and singular prioritization of shareholder value harken back to a more ruthless, exploitative era that seems in direct opposition to a woke, modern approach that puts customers first.  I personally find the company’s approach to value creation a little gross.  But that doesn’t mean this is a bad investment. Of course, it’s totally fine to present the case that TransDigm’s aggressive cost cuts and price hikes will blow up in its face one day, ultimately undermining shareholder value.  But for the reasons enumerated earlier, I don’t think that risk is as pressing as Citron makes it out to be (though I am keeping my mind open to this possibility).  And as an opportunist, you might argue that the “yuck” factor gives rise to a compelling price/value discrepancy.       

Let’s assume no acquisitions going forward.  Under this unlikely scenario, I think it’s reasonable to assume 4%-5% organic aftermarket volume growth going forward, in line with industry RPMs.  There are some inventory stocking and destocking events, as well as some maintenance deferral that render aftermarket growth somewhat more volatile than the long-term RPM, but these fluctuations offset over time.  It’s not a big deal unless you’re a sell-side analyst grinding your teeth over quarter to quarter trends.  Tack on a few points for pricing and maybe we’re talking about 6%-8% aftermarket revenue growth.

The extended period of robust OEM build rates is concerning:

![](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/pic11.png)

Whereas most trough-to-peak delivery cycles have endured for 5-7 years, we are now more than 15 years into the current upcycle, an anomaly that management has noted with some trepidation given that most the company’s labor is tied to OEM production rates.  In 2008/2009, deliveries barely budged.  I don’t know what to think of this.  I’ve heard that “this time is different” because commercial aircraft manufacturers have consolidated, but not sure I buy this as McDonnell Douglas was absorbed into Boeing in 1997 and Lockheed Aircraft’s terminal decline was apparent in the 1980s.  The OE business accounts for 45% of TransDigm’s revenue but just ~10% of EBITDA, so maybe this isn’t a huge deal.  You can decide for yourself. 

For the time being, I’m going to assume that 6% organic aftermarket growth translates into 8% EBITDA growth over the next 7 years.  Applying a few simplifying assumptions(9), ~70% of EBITDA falls down to unlevered free cash flow.  Assuming a 10% discount rate and 3% perpetual growth (implies a year 7 EBITDA multiple of 14x), I can discount back to $25bn of equity value, which is right around where the market cap is today.  In other words, if you buy into the above assumptions, then the stock doesn’t appear to be pricing in the mid-20s returns that TransDigm will be earning on the substantial cash flows it will likely be plowing into acquisitions over the next 7 years.  But take this with a grain of salt as this exercise is highly sensitive to the discount rate.  For instance, moving the discount rate from 10% to 12% brings the discounted equity value down to $16bn, in which case you’re no longer getting management’s capital allocation prowess “for free”.

(5) Third-party PMA parts have a terrific track record for reliability.  Yet, they account for less than 3% of industry commercial aftermarket revenue, as they have been unfairly perceived as lower quality and so detract from residual values.  Adoption has also been stymied in part by engine manufacturers, who bundle their parts into long-term service contracts.

To arrive at 5-year incremental returns, I take the difference in EBITDA from Y1 to Y6 and divide that result in the delta in gross capital from Y0 to Y5.  I shift the EBITDA measurement period by a year to correct numerator/denominator mismatches at the start and end of the measurement period.  For instance, if you close on an acquisition at the very end of the fiscal year, the year-end balance sheet will reflect the acquisition, but the income from that year will not.
