# Your Newsletter Landing Page and Blog

### ![](https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/521483/images/265/e75/ff1/7.png)

### Ok so thus far you have:

1.  Your why
2.  Your NAV & Your 3 C's 
3.  Your idea for your blog
4.  10-30 new potential blog posts (with your idea pad)
5.  An Evernote full of potential short blog prompts
6.  Your format for your newsletter stolen from other stubstack top writers
7.  A file full of a bunch of other blog writers if you need inspiration
8.  Your avatar of your future readers

**WHEWWWW... If you don't have all of that take a pause and go back and complete them.** 

Now on to the next step... you're landing page. But first... 

### **Our original landing page and blog was on Substack.**

Here's why that was a terrible idea... tell me what do you notice here? 

Here's one Substack... Pomp.

Here's another... Dispatch

Here's another... The Rebooting![](https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/521483/images/392/369/6a0/Screen_Shot_2021-08-04_at_2.36.01_PM.png)

You tell me. 

Any of these bad boys stand out? Oh no? Of course not. 

They have no originality. After all, would you rather subscribe here:

## OR THIS BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF LOVELY?

## Well considering our conversions 10x'd after we switched to this format, I am going to say the latter. 

Let's listen to the OG Blake on how to sass up your landing page. 

He reviewed hundreds of them and here's his [takeaway list for you](https://twitter.com/heyblake/status/1413117920209604609?s=20).

### **How to Create A Killer Landing Page:**

-   Value Add headlines / messaging: the use of strong verbs and keeping it short yet descriptive. Let me give you some examples. 

Grow Getters - Here's what we originally had.

-   ![Machine generated alternative text:growgetters.substack.com A Substack newsletter by Codie Sanchez o (546k' Grow Getters A newsletter about growth-hacking newsletters. "Can't Hack It" isn't in our vocabulary. Type your email.. Subscribe Let me read it first > Login Privacy Terms Information collection notice ](https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/521483/images/4e2/f9b/c82/1629127154479.jpg)
    

This was duplicative, didn't make someone want to take action, and wasn't pithy enough. If you have the logo with your name in it, no need to repeat. 

Instead, we changed to...  "Become a Growth Hacking Pro Week by Week"

Then added a longer description:

-   "We break down any and all newsletter growth hacks week by week and give you The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. We show you how we jump-started to 1000 subscribers in one week, then 3k, then 10k. Join us for the ride as we break down the process every step of the way." Honestly, we may not even need the last sentence.

### Couple notes from the best:

The original Contrarian landing page looked like this... 

![Machine generated alternative text:contrarianthinking.substack.com/subscribe A Substack newsletter by Codie Sanchez o Contrarian Thinking Contrarian Arbitrage = finding opportunity between common narrative and truth. Invest, build wealth, and grow businesses the contrarian way. Type your email..

See the difference when you compare to the top players? Our signup forms should be bigger (as big as possible: see Morning Brew and The Hustle).

![Machine generated alternative text:C morningbrew.com MORNING BREW Become smarter in just 5 minutes Get the daily email that makes reading the news actually enjoyable.

We also should have a bigger text for the word Subscribe (and bold font) and a much bolder shade of red.    

![Machine generated alternative text:thehustle.co theHUSTLE Get the daily news straight to your inbox Sign up for The Hustle - business and tech news in 5 minutes or less Your email address Join Free 10:18 AM ](https://files.cdn.thinkific.com/file_uploads/521483/images/84e/902/de7/1629127110069.jpg)

You want one focal point for your eye. We didn't have that in the beginning, make sure you do. 

**Take action:**

1.  Mock up a little design based on one of these competitors you like
2.  Take it to 99 designs or your designer or fiverr or whatever get it designed
3.  Write your copy using our tricks and tools above

Now we go on to picking your platform.

**Bonus Tip:**

On your landing page, make sure the headline and the copy they see tell them EXACTLY what they're going to get, and what they're going to GAIN from subscribing. 

Maybe offer a little bonus to incentivise sign-ups?
