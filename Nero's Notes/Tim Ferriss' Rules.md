# Tim Ferriss' Rules


Tim Ferriss' great rules to go by:

-  Ask great questions. Ex: How can i implement my 10 years goal in 6 months?
-  When there is indecision (ex: a lot of items on a to-do list), ask: which one of this items, if done, would make the rest irrelevant or much easier? This is a key question to ask all the time.
-  Lower your standards if you have writer's block. Two crappy pages per day.
-  Be focused. Remember item number 2 and focus on this one.
-  Unplug and Reset
-  Schedule your time: time consuming, high priority projects should have dedicated uninterrupted 3 to 4 hours block of time
