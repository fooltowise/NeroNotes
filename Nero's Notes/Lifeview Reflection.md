- Why are we here?
- What is the meaning or purpose of life?
- What is the relationship between the individual and others?
- Where do family, country, and the rest of the world fit in?
- What is good, and what is evil?
- Is there a higher power, God, or something transcendent, and if so, what impact does this have on my life?
- What is the role of joy, sorrow, justice, injustice, love, peace, and strife in life?


The meaning of life has many aspects. For instance, from a biological point of view, the meaning of life is that our genes want to self-perpetuate, and so we are an uninterrupted string of organisms having successfully reproduced over the last billion years.

Nevertheless, I don't think there is an absolute general Meaning to life, at least in the spiritual sense. When you keep asking, you always arrive at one of these three cases:
- an infinite chain of why's (Why A? Because of B. Why B? Because of C.... and so on )
- an axiom that is not falsifiable (God is such an axiom , the Big Bang is another one)
- a circular reference (Why A? because of B. Why B? Because of A.)


In some way, this is good news. If there was a general meaning of life, we would all be competing between ourselves to chase it, in a never-ending social status contest.

But this also means I have to find for myself the rules of my own life. How do I want to govern my life?
- I want it to matter. That is my sense of "meaning". What would happen if I was not here? Would the people around me be better or worse off? As a boy scout would say, will I leave the campground in a better shape than I found it? Will I improve, in my own little way, the life of my social circle, my friends, and my family? In three generations, it is likely that nobody will remember who I was. But as long as I am there, I want people to think that it's a bit better when I'm around.
- I want it to be pleasant. Meaning is nice, but there is a clear boundary: I don't want to be a martyr. I guess this is what people would call "happiness", "contentment", or what-not. Fortunately by now I have a pretty good idea of what makes my life pleasant:
	- Being in the nature
	- Close relationships with friends and family
	- Doing sports
	- Learning new skills and concepts, and applying them to my life (lifelong learning)
	- Being in a state of flow, where I perform a task that is just challenging enough, but not too hard - I then have extreme focus and time becomes irrelevant. This can happen in many context, and funnily enough, it always occur when some sort of "play" is involved. 
	- Having the feeling that whatever happens to me, I can always choose my response and this is the only thing I can control (yup, Epictetus had a big influence on me).

I also approach my life from an "inversion" point of view. As Charlie Munger says, "All I want to know is where I am going to die, so I won't go there". There are certain things that are guaranteed to make my life miserable, and I should get rid of them as quickly as possible:
- Poor health (2019 taught me what back pain means, it's no fun)
- Chronic stress
- Sleep deprivation
- Envy
- Constant comparison to others
- Over-reliance on external validation
- Depression
- A dysfunctional marriage
- Etc.
