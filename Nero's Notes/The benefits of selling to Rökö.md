# Tomas Billing on the benefits of selling to [[Röko]]

For example, I am currently conducting a DD on a firm in the UK. We had two UK PE funds in the process. And we explained to the entrepreneur that **if we buy your firm, it will stay in [[Röko]] forever.**

  

In contrast, the PE model is based on flipping it, which may pan out ok. But PE increases uncertainty about what will happen next for your personnel and other stakeholders. PE wants to double profits in three years and turn on the turbo. Turbo can make sense, and [[Röko]] can also partner with you in that capacity, should it be appropriate. But it increases risk.

  

We rather see incremental improvements, for example, hiring one salesperson at a time instead of 17 in one blow. **We build brick by brick.**

  

The decentralised model is also unique in the UK. There are no Rökos, Lifcos, or Indutrades, so we are met with _“wow, is that possible?”_. They find it strange, so we spend considerable time explaining our model.

  

They ask, _“Will you be involved in operations?”_ and we answer that [[Röko]] does not even really “exist” in the UK; we have four - soon five - people in our investment committee. We will sit on the board, and strategic decisions will be made together, but day-to-day business is all you. **If you want to hire or fire people, it is your responsibility.**

  

Many believe that we are constantly meeting companies, and of course, we do that, but **our primary marketing is conducted towards business brokers.** We have relations with around 600 brokers. A broker facilitates almost all transactions in niches fitting our criteria. And we think that is good. 

  

Of course, there are benefits to speaking with entrepreneurs directly. But we want the entrepreneur to look at the menu and see what buyers are out there to get a feel for who they trust and become comfortable that they are getting a fair deal.

  

**A brokered process often creates great chemistry for [[Röko]].** For example, we never bring consultants when we meet entrepreneurs. Fredrik and I have the majority of votes in [[Röko]], and the seller can understand who they are dealing with. In contrast, PE brings consultants wherever they go, and they can be talented - but as an entrepreneur, you want to meet the ones in charge, which is crystal clear when dealing with [[Röko]].

  

Building relationships with brokers is vital but challenging. We need to make a lot of calls, as email rarely works.
