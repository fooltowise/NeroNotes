# [[Constellation Software]] Shareholder Q&A, October 2018


**Question **

Besides the classic financial reward (salary + bonus + shares), what does Constellation usually do to attract, retain and motivate its employees, especially at lower levels in the organization structure? In other words, what drives the employees to make "the extra effort" for their business units? Does the company track employees' engagement and morale metrics among its Operating Groups? If yes, what is the evolution of these metrics as the company gets bigger and more decentralized?


**Response**

There are two questions. I’ll respond to the second first: Does CSI track the engagement & morale metrics of our Operating Groups? 

Engagement and morale metrics are not something we track from head office. Implicit in the question, is the assumption that superior employee engagement and morale, coupled with head office supervision, will lead to better company performance. 

I noticed employee engagement as a topic a couple of months ago when one of our groups hired a speaker to talk about it at their off-site meeting. A bit of casual Googling showed me that employee engagement was starting to get buzz in the business press and Amazon had a slew of books on the topic by general purpose business gurus (“GPBG”). I’m suspicious of GPBG’s, so I started digging for relevant scholarly research. A resource that I like is the Centre for Evidence Based Management’s library website, where you can search for systematic reviews and meta analyses ( http://cebma-library.org/ ). Normal humans don’t have the time and/or skills to wade through 1000’s of research papers to generate informed opinions. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses do a lot of the work for us. 

The consistent criticisms of employee engagement as a cause of business unit performance seemed to be three-fold: employee engagement is a fuzzily defined concept, it isn’t clear that it causes performance (although a correlated concept, job satisfaction, does appear to be a cause performance), and there are a large number of other factors that have statistically significant effects upon performance, the most compelling of which is an employee’s satisfaction with their supervisor.

One of the fundamental beliefs at CSI, is that autonomy motivates people, and bureaucracy does the opposite, so we try to do as many of the important monitoring tasks with as light a touch as possible. I notice CSI managers who can’t retain good subordinates. This isn’t data provided by a head office supervisory system and doesn’t involve any bureaucracy… just personal awareness. I think our Operating Group Managers and Portfolio Managers monitor turnover similarly. This practice seems more likely to improve performance with less effort than tracking engagement and morale metrics. 

And the first question: What does CSI do to attract, retain and motivate employees? 

Our internal recruiters use all the normal methods to attract new employees: job boards, search consultants, LinkedIn, referral fees for current employees who generate successful candidates, etc. Attracting employees works best for me via my network. I get better folks who tend to stay. Retaining employees seems to require big doses of opportunity and occasional empathy: Opportunity because the best employees want more… more knowledge, more money, more responsibility, and more autonomy. Empathy because they are pushing their limits and sometimes crack. Motivation seems to come from the team and the task. If employees work with people that they respect on tasks that are important, then finding the motivation isn’t a problem.

**Question**
Is the traditional moat around software shrinking as:
1. Absolute development/compute/storage/distribution costs fall,
2. Startup costs become increasingly variable vs. fixed (e.g pay-per-drink compute/storage offerings like AWS and increased availability of developer tools/API)
3. Capital has becomes more aggressively available 
4. Product distribution via internet/SaaS model has become cheaper, easier and faster, with lower switching costs?

Is the current reality of software a lower moat business now versus the days of deeply entrenched, costly to create, costly to install/sell/service/customize, multi-product suites of the past like SAP/ORCL?

In a related question - could this mean the niche TAMs that Constellation operates in historically were illogical to compete in ("not worth it") are more "at risk" going forward given software development and distribution seems to be much easier, cheaper and more variable now than it was ten years ago?

**Response - Mark**

There's little doubt that the cloud + amortized payment models + single instance multi-tenant software (let's call this technology/economic model "SaaS" for the purposes of this response) had significantly lowered the up-front costs of equipment for new SaaS entrants, has the potential to both speed up and lower their costs of development and customer acquisition, and has attracted huge amounts of capital to finance the creation of new SaaS products. As to your related question, I think smaller TAM's (TAM is venture capital speak for "Total Adressable Market") are more viable today than ever before if start-up capital is available. The "if" is important, as new SaaS products consume a lot of up-front cash.

Over the entire value chain and over long periods of time, it isn't clear to me how much value will be created by the move to SaaS. Nor is it clear to me how the value created (if any) will get shared amongst clients, their software vendors and the cloud hosting companies:

If SaaS players consistently compete for new clients based on low prices, then the clients will likely be the largest beneficiaries of the platform change.
If the big three cloud vendors use the pricing leverage provided by the proprietary development and infrastructure management tools that they offer to developers, then they may get to extract a large portion of the benefits from the platform change.
If new name client acquisition costs are rational and the cloud vendors don't succeed in materially raising developers' switching costs, then perhaps software vendors who make the platform transition will also get to participate in the benefits of the move to SaaS.

I think the demand for SaaS (as defined above) amongst clients will be based upon their budgets and the desired "proprietaryness" of their software and data. Nearly all clients would like to have custom developed enterprise-wide software suites tailored to their chosen business processes and strategy. Those with really deep pockets will want to keep their proprietary data and processes private.

Many more clients will not be able to afford custom software and their own IT infrastructure, and hence will take pre-packaged software that is either highly configurable or allows for customization. They may or may not want this hosted in the cloud.

The clients with the smallest IT budgets need to accept software with little or no customization, and it will almost certainly be hosted in the cloud.

SaaS is ideal for customers who have strict financial constraints, and hence is an existential threat to vendors of on-premise legacy software solution selling into the low-priced software segment. I believe that legacy solution with browser and smartphone based user interfaces will remain the dominant solution in the mid-tier market for many years to come. True SaaS solutions strike me as unlikely to replace a significant portion of large custom-developed solutions in my lifetime.

On a more pragmatic note, the organic growth or contraction of CSI's recurring revenues and free cash flow should give you a pretty good sense of the impact on CSI of new SaaS entrants.

I asked Barry Symons who runs our Jonas Operating Group to provide you with an example from his portfolio. His response appears below. I think you'll get a sense of how his incumbent club software business fortified their moat in the face of technological disruption and potential new entrants.

**Response - Barry**

Thanks for the question(s), below would be our thoughts:

On the moat issue, I think economic theory would say that if you have a business/industry that can produce above average returns for extended periods of time, intelligent people and capital will find ways to get into the industry and thus over time increase the competitiveness of the business/industry and by definition reduce the size of the moat. We are seeing some of the effects of the points you raised, however, I also believe that these are not changing at rapid speed (as we have witnessed so far) and thus if we are paying attention and responding appropriately we can defer their impact (materially speaking) for a very long time.


Specifically to the 4 items you mention there is no doubt that they have the potential to reduce the size of the moats we have, but we are actively working on things to counteract these threats. A great example of this would be the club market, which is one of our large verticals. When we first entered the club market back in 2003 (via acquisition of Jonas) we were not the market share leader and we did not have a "complete" enterprise product but we saw lots of potential. Over the last 15 years in the face of the challenges you mentioned we have managed (at least in my opinion .... I am sure our competitors may feel a bit differently) to not only maintain the size of the moat but in fact expand it:
1. We continued to invest in new name sales as we were seeing great traction and the economics were compelling (we measure our sales & marketing investment relative to long term value of the customers acquired)
2. We realized that we needed to have more of an enterprise-wide offering : our mantra has always been to try to be the one shop for all clients' software/technology needs. Thus we built or purchased the products we did not have and began selling them back to our base of clients to truly have an enterprise product. This makes our offering to our customers even more valuable and thus reduces their desire to leave us for the competition.
3. We acquired some of our competitors to strengthen our position in the market
4. We paid attention to changing trends in the market and developed solutions our clients would one day need... hopefully before they needed them. Since 2003 many things have evolved and changed and we have responded accordingly such as:
	1. Websites - just having a web presence
	2. Interactive websites - allowing the club members to actually utilize the website for booking tee times, event sign up, court booking, review their statements etc.
	3. Member communications - email marketing and text messaging modules that did not exist in 2003
	4. Payments - back in 2003 the club world was pretty much all invoice and check. That has transitioned tremendously and we have built the solutions to help our clients embrace digital payments.
	5. Mobile computing - as things transitioned we moved our product to our clients' and their members' smartphone - first with responsive designs and then with club specific mobile apps.
5. We evolved how we delivered our products to our clients - back in 2003 we literally shipped our clients CDs' for every update that was needed (and we used to have huge FedEx bills) we evolved to digital downloads and have moved to having a cloud based offering for those who no longer want to host the product on site at the club.


There are many other changes I could go on about but the key message is each of these changes are things we have to respond to that give us the opportunity to deepen our moats if done properly.

I think in the end as long as we are producing above average returns there will be threats to our moats we need to deal with. However, if we are actively watching our KPI's on things like: Customer Satisfaction, Attrition Rates, Win Loss percentage, etc. we can hopefully course correct before any threat becomes overly material.

Finally, specific to the second question about "not worth it", I am sure some of the four items your mention have some impact, but in each of our verticals there is still a very large barrier to entry to get in the game while the four items you mention make it a bit easier to build a base product, the evolutions that happen (as noted in the club example) constantly increase the size of the base product, offsetting some of the attacker's advantage.At the same time the majority of the markets we serve are not rapidly expanding so the "size of the prize" is not growing significantly. Further, no matter what changes in the four items mentioned, the pain of switching a mission-critical enterprise application is still high. No matter how fast and cheap computing power becomes people do not like to change things that are working well unless the upside to the change is extremely compelling. Thus I think for the majority of our markets the "not worth it" comment continues to hold and that is evidenced by the limited number of new competitors we see in the majority of our verticals.

Hopefully the above gives you comfort that we are constantly thinking about these threats and doing our best to manage our shareholders capital in intelligent ways. I know we have made mistakes in the past an I am sure we will make many more in the future but if we respond quickly, rationally and intelligently we can hopefully maintain if not grow the size of our moats in a number of our stronger verticals while gracefully reducing our presence and investments where we have lost our edge.

**Question**

There are a number of successful companies who count the culture they have created as part of their moat or competitive advantage. Many of us shareholders believe CSU is one of those companies. However, could you elaborate on this where CSU is concerned and how important do you think the CSU culture is in the ability to drive solid shareholder returns in the long term.

**Response**

Page 2 of [[CSU Q&A July 2018]] answers part of your question... at least from my perspective.  If there's a more specific [[corporate culture]]-related query, don't hesitate to end it in to the Q&A website.

I'm leery of [[corporate culture]]. The popular business press has touted it as a tool to improve corporate performance for decades. I find it a fuzzy concept (values, beliefs, and ?) and a bit threatening. Actively promoting "correct [[corporate culture]]" has vague overtones of brainwashing and the cult-like expectation of acquiescence. I won't accept a set of values and beliefs that are foisted upon me, and I would not expect others to accept them, either.

I think we have lots of different sub-cultures and more than our share of heretics at CSI. Some of these sub-cultures will thrive, and some will fail. The cultures that are successful are likely to propagate their values and beliefs by example and by selection. With that sort of evolutionary process at play, my sense is that we don't need to be preaching [[corporate culture]] from head office.
