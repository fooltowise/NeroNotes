Bergamo province was one of the hardest-hit by the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. So many people died there because the hospitals got overwhelmed. Many perished in their houses because they couldn't access tests and therapies.

And yet, on average, the healthcare system worked great. *On average*, hospitals didn't see many coronavirus hospitalizations. On the worst day of the pandemic, only about 10% of Italian public hospital beds were occupied by coronavirus patients.

Average data does not tell us the full story. If every hospital in Italy had 10% of their beds occupied by patients, it wouldn't have been so bad. The problem is that the patients predominantly lived in the same region. A few hospitals got completely overwhelmed, while those in other regions didn't.

**A system can work well on average and still fail locally.**

**As an individual, you do not care whether the system works on average. You care if it works for you.**
