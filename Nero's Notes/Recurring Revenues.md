# Recurring Revenues

Recurring revenues arise when an existing customer base buys additional services or products from a company: jet engines requiring service, security systems with trailing surveillance and response, and periodicals with subscription renewals. The most powerful version arises when such obligations to pay for the service are lock-in. For instance, a customer who has already purchased equipment or software from the company is likely to require additional purchases from the provider in the future. The installed base of equipment then becomes an in-house monopoly with consistent revenue streams for the producer of the equipment. It becomes a virtuous cycle for the company: the larger the installed base, the bigger the monopoly, and the more predictable the revenue streams.

High degrees of recurring revenues increase the stability of a business and the predictability of its cash flows. Such benefits even hold true for companies operating in cyclical industries. Take elevators, for instance. Equipment sales fluctuate in tandem with new construction, an inherently cyclical business. But service revenue continues steadily through economic downturns as building owners, occupants, and governments put a premium on safety and reliability. Even as new installations fluctuate, the existence of an installed base makes revenue growth relatively predictable. Such stability can be very valuable to investors. It yields predictable business models for value creation even in industries exposed to the volatility of cycles. 

There are various models of recurring revenue:
- [[Product Upfront]]
- [[The License Model]]
- [[The Service Model]]
- [[Subscriptions]]
- [[Density and Network Benefits]]

Recurring revenues often come with great economic benefits (see [[Economics effects of recurring revenues]]).


Many companies enjoy some degree of recurring revenue and many managers strive to increase that component of overall operations, but a small amount of recurring revenue does not necessarily make a company great. Rather, for the pattern to warrant serious consideration as the signifier of quality, recurring revenues should be an overriding feature of the economics of the business - a trait we see in companies as seemingly diverse as Atlas Copco, Dassault Systems, Rolls Royce and KONE.
