The results of [[Network Theory and Scale]] indicate that lifespan scales with a 1/4 exponent compares to weight.

For human beings, it seems like there is a 125 years limit beyond which nobody ever lived (Jeanne Calment lived up to 122 years). Aging is the result of damage suffered by all cells as a consequence of byproducts of the respiratory cycle (ATP generation). "Dying of old age" is a synonym for saying that there came a point where too many cells in the body were damaged and failing. 

For more details, we already know that the number of cell scales linearly with weight, and that the metabolic rate scales with a 3/4 exponent with weight. As the metabolic rate is a proxy for the energy damaging cells, the lifespan of a mammal is proportional to 
$$
Lifespan \propto \frac{Number Of Cells}{Metabolic Rate} \propto \frac{A * Weight}{B * Weight^{\frac{3}{4}}} \propto  Weight ^{\frac{1}{4}}
$$


Curing vascular and cerebral accidents, cancers and respiratory issues will increase the age of death, but will not push it beyond 125 years, which looks like a structural barrier for the human body.
