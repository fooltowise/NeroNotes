Psychophysics is the study of how our senses alter our perception of a situation.
For instance, consider a delicious meal in a restaurant in two different contexts:
- The restaurant has a warm and cozy ambiance
- The restaurant is dirty and smells like sewers

While the taste of the meal should be objectively the same in both cases, our senses alter dramatically our enjoyment of the meal in the two different scenarios. Context matters a lot.
