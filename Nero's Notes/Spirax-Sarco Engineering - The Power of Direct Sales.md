# Spirax-Sarco Engineering: The Power of Direct Sales

### How would you describe the culture of the business at Spirax?

When I moved to England, it was my first experience of corporate life. It was a challenge going from managing a mid-sized German company to being a regional general manager, responsible for seven or eight operating companies with frequent travel. Today Spirax-Sarco are on the FTSE100; right now, they are at 59, but recently were as low as 52nd largest company on FTSE.

They have annual revenue of £1.3 billion with an operating profit of 23%, which is high for an engineering company. I can speak for Spirax, which is one of three very successful legs [[Spirax Sarco]] stands on. One of them is the steam specialty business, which is Spirax-Sarco and Gestra, a competitor they acquired several years ago. They do steam systems, condensate management, controls and thermal energy management. So what does that mean?

Mars Bars are covered in chocolate, which needs to be melted at some point in the process. Enormous vats of chocolate have to be heated in a very controlled fashion; too hot the chocolate burns, not hot enough the chocolate cannot flow. The best way to heat it is steam. Not the steam that comes out of your coffee cup, but the steam which is under pressure. If you heat water under pressure, it gets hotter than 100 degrees, which you guide to a big vat of chocolate. That steam goes into the chocolate in a controlled manner and becomes condensate.

It changes from gas to water and is boiling hot so you have to handle it properly. It has to be guided while simultaneously utilizing its energy with heat exchanges. The hot water runs into condensate traps which are drained when full. Spirax-Sarco Gestra have a worldwide annual revenue of £755 million at a profit of 23.6%, if I'm not entirely wrong, which is again extremely high for an engineering company.

Engineering is very often lower, which is why they are in the FTSE 100. The second leg is electrical thermal solutions, which I am not too familiar with. It is basically the same thing as steam but with electrics. If you are in Alaska and drilling for oil, the oil will not flow if it is too cold, so you have electrical hoses or wires which run along the pipeline ensuring the oil is heated. That is a very crude explanation of what they do, and they are called Chromalox in the US and Thermocoax in France.

### The third leg is Watson-Marlow.

They also have that leg, which is very successful with pumps and tubes.

### How is the direct sales team at Spirax organized?

The companies have synergies for IT and HR but the sales teams are separate. Each entity’s knowledge is highly specialized and they remain segregated where possible. Within Spirax, for example, there are both food and beverage and pharmaceutical industry specialists in identical areas, because they use different appliances.

### Do sales staff cross sectors for Spirax and Gestra in Germany?

Yes. In Germany, Gestra and Spirax are sister companies and have complementary products for complementary groups of customers. There is total clarity in who approaches each customer because their respective approaches are so different. In the early days, a team of five or six people – which is manageable for communication – would bid on anything that moves. Today there is a very clear idea of each team’s specialization.

Where there is too little business to allow for specialization, everybody does everything. When business grows to allow for specialization, it is much better for selling, more enjoyable for the sales team and beneficial to the customer.

### Does the customer really value the specialized knowledge of the plant and its systems?

Yes, in the past you would walk into a plant and see gigantic boilers bigger than a two-bedroom apartment, with someone or a team holding all the knowledge of how to run the boiler, use the steam and manage the condensate. Today, this has changed and the knowledge and people are no longer there. A Spirax engineer bridges that gap to the customer. The more specialized Spirax is, the better it is for a customer.

### That is also interesting, because when Spirax buy a business like Gestra, it is not a cost saving plan where you rationalize manufacturing or cut costs. They almost buy complementary assets to serve the same customers on different parts of the plant.

You would not have a Spirax and Gestra engineer visiting the same customer because they have different needs, but what happens at the customer is fascinating and was lovely for me to see. Spirax refers to this as generating unrecognized need. Slightly less than half the Spirax-Sarco steam specialty business revenue is from repeatable maintenance. If a flow trap fails, you have to have a new one. An additional 35% of all revenue comes from unrecognized need.

The direct sales engineer visits their customer simply to keep in contact. They spend an enormous amount of time walking through the plant, wearing their crash helmet and vest. They feel the boiler temperature to understand it while talking with the customer. The Spirax-Sarco engineer knows a lot and the customer knows what they need. Suddenly, a sales engineer realizes an opportunity the customer was not aware of. If you take that hot water and guide it to a heat exchanger, you would save money, which is good for the customer.

Due to the knowledge of the sales engineer, the customer realizes he could save money. There were little projects which would have a payback period of two years. From year three, the customer and Spirax engineers are making money, which is a win-win situation.

### Spirax have deep expertise and knowledge in steam systems which is effectively what the customer pays for, in addition to implementation of the product?

That is exactly right.

### How would a Nestlé get a company such as Spirax into their plant? Would they send out a request and how would Spirax bid for that work?

Things have changed a lot recently. Spirax would classify Nestlé as an end-customer, not an OEM, because they buy stuff which they use directly. Spirax PLC have 8,000 staff of which 1,600, or every fifth person, is a direct sales or service engineer. They have a direct sales presence in 130 units in 66 countries. One way for Nestlé – which is exactly how it happens – is they are in their plant wondering why steam is escaping where it should not. They quickly pick up the phone and a Spirax person is at the end of the line and will come to their plant in their country. That is very direct and local.

### That is if they have a Spirax machine or system?

Exactly, or if they have questions about steam in general, because the other thing Spirax offer is training. If you type “steam system in Tukkatookaland” in a search engine, there is a high probability Spirax will come up because they are worldwide. There are very few worldwide steam specialists; there are local ones, but not global. Now if you are a plant manager in Tukkatookaland with an issue, you may or may not go to Spirax because you might have a friend who knows about this.

This is where the second sales approach comes in. Large global corporations, such as Nestlé, who are incredibly professional, knowledgeable and extremely well-organized, prefer talking with suppliers who understand their language, who also function on a global level and understand what it means if something goes wrong in the jungle. There is a team, at Spirax, working with large corporate end-customers who speak with Nestlé's main purchasing manager. Large customers, like Nestlé, are very strategic and have clear ideas where to focus, whether it is packaged food or coffee. When we go into the shop to buy another snack for our dog, not many people are aware what is behind this.

There are teams, on a continental level, figuring out which plant producing cat food will work on what sort of efficiency and performance improvement. This is where Spirax has a team of people who thresh that all out and implement it. It is highly strategic selling approach which requires a different skill set.

### If a Spirax sales engineer walks through the Nestlé plant with me, what is the process from there?

The Nestlé guy has a basic idea of the problem and would share that with the Spirax engineer, who would go to the problem location, which could be some parts failing. He would use a heat camera to show up very hot areas which should not obviously be, and could then recommend which exchange or condensate traps need to be replaced. Perhaps they would continue walking and discuss targets, performance improvements and efficiency gains, which all amount to saving money.

You would want to impress your boss with a few ideas and the Spirax engineer could ask how your system is running and what process you are working on. You are Nestlé and the Spirax engineer is a specialist in food and beverage, otherwise he would not be allowed into your plant. You would show him around, what you do with hot water, and perhaps he notices some condensate going down the drain. He could tell you this is strictly no longer allowed in certain countries and why not take this hot water through a heat exchanger, to heat the office in which you always sit and think is too cold. I am making this up, but that would be a good example of having customer loyalty, solving an immediate problem, but because they talk and trust each other, they can find or generate new unrecognized needs.

### How do you get new customers? If I am a new customer building a new plant, what is the decision-making process in choosing a vendor like a Spirax or Armstrong?

When Nestlé builds a new plant, they come to corporate headquarters and discuss it together so that their needs can be properly understood. That is followed by an official RFQ process, where Nestlé sends out a number of products, parts or systems, asking Spirax and competitors to quote. Ideally, because you are friends and I solved your hot water problem, you call me and tell me what you want to build. Maybe I have a few ideas about improvements, then whatever is specified in your house strongly resembles products offered by Spirax.

### How would you compare a Spirax offering to other big players in that process?

Very difficult, because many competitors offer a number of parts but not all of which are required. There are parts and units but also engineering. If you want a pressure reducing station which consists of many different parts, all you know is the pressure which comes in and out. If Nestlé sent this to several suppliers, you would have a lot of work, because each supplier would come back with questions such as, what is the medium and are we talking water or oil?

How much space do I have, where does it go; on the roof or in the cellar? What is the ambient temperature? What usually happens is that you are good friends with one of the suppliers and you come up with an idea because that is what a specialist would ask you. You might have the idea of putting the pressure reducing station on your roof and I might say, sure but you want to do this in Russia, where it is cold in winter and it might freeze in, so why not put it there? We would develop something together and it would be specified in-house, then put out for tender.

### So Nestlé would consult Spirax or another player in the specification and then put it out for tender, but know they will choose Spirax or the person or company who specified the system?

That is the same all over the world, but it might go the other way around. I remember getting specifications, going through them and saying, I know who developed that and it was not us. You then talk with the people and tell them they can built it that way, but they can also build it this way, so you try to change the specification.

### The real value for Nestlé is choosing a provider with a comprehensive solution rather than dealing with 10 different suppliers?

Indeed, however the purchasing manager has to bring at least three different quotes, which is only fair. This is where direct selling comes in. If you and I have a good contact, you will ask for two others, but you will know what you want and I will help you justify that, because it would be in my interest to provide you with the best solution.

### What is the biggest risk to losing customers, for a company like Spirax?

The biggest risk is a very good question; I have never lost a customer.

### When does Spirax lose customers? Have they ever lost a customer?

I am sure they have. I could imagine the following case: you are talking to a local OEM customer who builds cheap boilers. They want them to last exactly as long as the warranty period. These customers exist and want the lowest price for their components. They will say they need many of this component but will not put that in writing; please give me your lowest price. You quote and they say no, that is too expensive, I have a different offer from Quicky Quacky company, who are half your price.

There is a point where you have to bow out, because your prices are justified by being worldwide. If you build something and sell it globally, one of our guys can fix it for you. He will say, I only build my boilers here for Tukkatookaland North and when I grow, I might sell them in Tukkatookaland South. You step away then and say, good luck to you, buy from Quicky Quacky, which they do because that is their only option, but the quality is lower and they will not grow.

### For big corporations, like Nestlé, where the majority of capital or revenue is in the market, what do they care about?

It is about the reliability, the brand and knowing that when something happens, someone will be there. I cannot provide names, but Spirax have put people on a plane and sent them to the jungle where there were palm oil plants. You need to understand it is not an English plant and the health and safety is nowhere near what we think is normal. In this case, it was not a Spirax-Sarco product which failed. The customer was so distressed and in so much trouble that in the end, Spirax flew an engineer out and it was solved and paid.

But that was not the point, the point was to win a customer who would never, ever forget that Spirax saved the day.

### You are the sales engineer in my plant at Nestlé and we agree on a new boiler or system; what drives the pricing for the system?

Yes, that is one of my favorite questions. I will tell you a different story from when I was managing the German company and we were asked to come up with a humidification system in a nuclear plant. You want to be careful when selling to them, because if anything goes wrong, they will sue you until the cows come home. My engineers went away and calculated it and it was not particularly difficult. We need this and that and three of those and that is my material price. Maike always says we need a mark-up of X, that is my price. Because the whole system was more expensive than usual, they showed it to me, and I said no, we cannot quote this.

They said, why not? It is exactly how you told us to quote, get the material, the mark-up and put on 5% so the customer can negotiate us down, where is the problem, Maike? I said, it is a large project where many things can go wrong; you have to build this into the price. More importantly, it is a nuclear station. If anything goes wrong, I will make many lawyers rich; we have to factor this into the price. The bigger the project, even a turnkey product, mark-up higher and build in a little for anger and worry.

### Are the margins higher for larger projects? I thought they would be lower?

That is what most people think. Imagine a small country, I cannot give you the name, but it was one of mine. On one of my visits, we were having dinner and the general manager says, for dessert I have a big surprise for you Maike. He gave me the order for a turnkey project quoted, in excess of £1 million, for a small sales company in one of our areas, and my heart stopped. I said, oh my God. He said what is wrong, are you not happy? I said no, I am not at all happy.

It is way too big for you. The two sales engineers that have dug this up, will be busy for the better part of a year, holding this customer's hand. During this time, they will not drum up any other business in their areas. That means, for a year after you pay the price, if anything goes wrong, your operating profit or margin you calculated will fly out the window. We had a crisis meeting with everyone around the table. In the end, everything was well prepared and it went okay, except for one little mistake, which resulted in a low profit. These large projects tend to cause more headaches and cost much more.

All future consequences need to be thought through, which many people do not see. Other companies calculate exactly the way my German engineers did. They say, material, some mark-up, extra for headaches, that is the price, and they quote. Because it is such a large project, it is very difficult to contain everything and drive it, so the profit ends up being too low. Large projects should be priced much higher than usual. How many companies specialize in turnkey projects and have an operating profit of 24%? 5% to 10% is the norm; in German we say, the water is always here.

### Why makes Spirax so special it can charge those prices and be sustainable?

That is a good question because having every fifth person on the road as a direct sales or service engineer is an extremely expensive way of selling. You cannot sell in a more expensive way, therefore you need high prices. Spirax are not the cheapest but they have this little extra that you can always call somebody to help improve efficiency. In the Nestlé example, I could find something that saves half a million every year.

Do you think it matters if the system I quote costs £100,000 or £105,000? You do not care, even when I tell you I am more expensive than others. I am also better and hold your hand through the whole process, and I had the idea which will save you money.

### Do you see that pricing power because of the knowledge and service you give to customers?

Everybody increases prices annually, because everything becomes more expensive all the time. This is how a capitalist system works. You cannot increase to the moon, that would not be fair, but you can have intelligent pricing. Spirax-Sarco have 100,000 different products. If I were to do what I did with my previous company where I went to lists and printouts, that would be many dark nights. Today, you can optimize this with the help of algorithms which identify which products will not increase, because the prices are okay the way they are and your competitors stock the same.

In this country, think of Tesco and Lidl. They have algorithms working on this because Tesco can no longer afford to be more expensive than Lidl for clearly defined products, such as milk, vegetables and bread. If you need batteries – as I needed the other day – Tesco can charge whatever they like for batteries, not atrociously high, but less limited, because Lidl do not sell them. If you need a pint of milk, three potatoes and some batteries, you will go to Tesco and not realize how expensive they are.

This is a convoluted way of explaining how modern algorithms manage high data volumes to optimize product prices, dependent on competition and customer need. A direct salesperson, going to Nestlé, might have an amazing product idea, which together they can develop a unique product. Nestlé will buy it and we will make it because nobody else can. There is no Lidl price on that.

### If you are the only supplier and you provide extra knowledge and cost-saving ideas, there is huge value add; whether you price 100 or 105 is irrelevant to the customer.

Yes, value add and brand recognition.

### What is the biggest risk to that high operating margin for Spirax?

Biggest risks are numerous, for example, if suppliers are no longer there. If you need some material from the foundries who close due to COVID, you cannot deliver. The risk to margin is margin erosion, which today, you can also check with software programs rolled out worldwide. You can check each product ever sold and see if it has been lower and, if so, why.

In the past, weak sales engineers would walk away when a customer said they could not support a price increase. Perhaps a new engineer would help or support margin erosion by not increasing prices because they do not know how to negotiate or stand their ground.

### How do you incentivize sales engineers?

All sales engineers are trained in the Spirax-Sarco Sales Academy where you are graded in belts similar to Judo or Karate. You begin with the lowest, which I think is yellow, and progress to a black belt. It starts with simple organizational skills. How do I plan my day when I drive to my customers; do I drive like this or like this? How do I do time management? You learn about products and negotiation techniques. How do you negotiate prices – the big thing for everybody – or how do you not negotiate prices; maybe you negotiate something else entirely.

This is introduced once you reach brown belt and understand industry applications. You know how a bottle washer functions at Nestlé. I speak as if I know, but I do not have any belts. For anyone entering sales, I recommend this training because you may be extremely gifted, good with customers, almost telepathic in understanding customers, but maybe you need simple skills, which is part of what the academy offers.

I learned one thing when I started selling. Using the Nestlé example again, we talk about something which would give a sales engineer 100,00 revenue, and I am already thinking this is going to be a great bonus for me this year. I then have to ask if the right decision makers are in the room. You might not be the guy who signs the order and I have to ask if you have the money? You might have to ask your boss about the budget. I also have to ask if you have the money this year, because you might think you will get it the next year.

Very often, a sales engineer will walk away happy, but has not spoken with the decision maker or does not understand budgets or timelines for investments. These are simple things being trained at the Spirax-Sarco Sales Academy, in addition to all the product knowledge.

### Do they get paid a simple bonus, based on sales?

10 years ago, the more you sold the more commission you received. What is wrong with that picture? You will sell whatever and if I am the general manager, I might see you sell all the low-profit items and none that provide high margins. This has changed in many companies and there are various setups. I am a big believer in paying a fixed basic salary of around 25% to 30%. It will just tide you over; if you do not get out of bed it would keep you in Lidl pints of milk and pay your rent, but only that.

You have to get out every morning and visit your customers, be creative and have ideas. 60% would come from commission, and this commission would depend on what you sell. If you sell spares, which are being sold even if you stay in bed, you only get a small commission. The balance of commission comes from this unrecognized need you develop with your customer, generating new sales your customer never thought of. That is where you get the biggest commission which fires you up because it is fun.

### You mentioned 50% of Spirax revenue comes from recurring maintenance spend.

Yes, in every country and company in the world the money is in the spares. The company I managed earlier in my career had 30% revenue and profit from spares. If I sat at home with my feet up, it would still come, but you have to watch it and build your products around it. You also need to offer good service. So yes, spares is where the fun is.

### How do you increase the penetration of maintenance revenue as a percentage of total sales to increase the recurring revenue?

I always used to tell my guys, go sell units, because the more units out there in the world, the more spares we will sell. When visiting customers, look at the units you sold two or three years ago – they may not be maintained – encourage maintenance and offer a new pump here. Look at those units and take the time. One day, one of my English guys called me from the Tate Gallery cellar, which is full of humidification equipment, with a broken heart. He told me they were not maintaining our units and that they look unloved. When I asked what he did he smiled and said, I recommended they scrap them and buy new ones, which they did.

The message was to not only look at the units you sold, but also always try to generate more maintenance sales.

### Can we talk about the difference between end users and OEM customers?

72% of Spirax customers are direct customers. You just said OEM, did I hear you right, that is an indirect customer or indirect sales?

### I think they classify them as 71% direct sales, 42% of which is direct to end-customer and 20% to OEM.

That is exactly right, and I had the honor and privilege to be part of a small group when the Spirax-Sarco strategy was developed in 2014. We had long and heated discussions as to whether OEMs are direct almost end-customers or are they indirect sales like re-sellers and distributors? Is it beneficial to understand what an OEM really is or do you think your listeners know?

### Sure.

OEM stands for original equipment manufacturers and these are customers who buy components with which they build their own units which they then sell. Tetra Pak make beverage cartons and are one of the biggest filling machinery producers globally and are incredibly professional, well-organized and strategic and are always looking for new modern applications.

They are a classical OEM. To give you an idea of what Spirax-Sarco is, I will tell you about a lovely thing I saw recently which happened on my watch. Eggs come from chickens whose sheds need to be heated in winter because only happy chickens give you happy eggs. Farming industry margins are extremely small, which is why farmers can go bust very quickly. They need to watch their energy intake to bring costs down. A big cost in the poultry industry is waste removal and the bedding is all straw which is pooped on.

There is also unused food which has to be regularly cleared from chicken sheds. Spirax worked together with an OEM customer who was a manufacturer of bio material boilers. They took all that waste and burnt it in a bio way, also using the gas, and with this energy they heated water to warm up the chicken sheds, making 2,000 chickens happy. An OEM customer is somebody who buys individual products, components, or mini applications, like a pressure reducing station for example, which they use in their machines, which they sell globally.

### Is that direct because you deal with them the same way as an end customer?

I have always been of the opinion that this is a direct contact. It is not the direct contact to the local buyer of the bio mass boiler for their chicken shed; I will not speak to farmers, but Spirax will talk to the boilermaker. It is a direct way of understanding what the engineers need, helping them improve performance and once completed, repeat business follows. If our bio mass boiler manufacturer sells this to Tukkatookaland South, ensure a Spirax-Sarco sales engineer is there to help that farmer if something breaks.

It is a direct customer contact and not the classical indirect selling you have with re-sellers or distributors with limited influence and contact. If you sell to a distributor who sells to their customers, the Spirax direct sales engineer will not see those customers or know what is going on because all these customers buy our spare parts. Self-generated sales cannot occur unless my distributor or re-seller allows me to accompany them to those customers.

That is unusual and only possible with trust between the sales guy and distributor.

### How does price and margin differ between OEM businesses and direct selling?

To end customers there is not that much difference.

### Is it quite similar because the price is governed by value?

The effort is the same, therefore, so is the cost for the seller. Of course, the price levels represent the numbers. If you offer a system to a multinational OEM such as Tetra Pak, because you sell many you would build that into your pricing structure. You would do the same with an end-customer though, so it is similar.

### Tetra Pak deal with their customer directly but they consult Spirax for a system they might need. Do they have more negotiating power than Nestlé because they own that relationship and the bargaining power in the agreement?

If Nestlé and Tetra Pak sent out an RFQ for the same product and amount, they would both have similar negotiation leverage. This is why I say it is, basically, a direct sales approach from the seller's side. This is completely different with a re-seller or distributor because Spirax does not have the cost of having their own people in the region, so they would quote and offer a discount. There is much less revenue and profit, but no cost to selling in a given area. You also have no impact and it is difficult to gauge the market without speaking directly to customers.

### How much opportunity is there for Spirax to increase that OEM business?

Huge; one of my last roles before retiring was setting up an OEM strategy, and we only scratched the surface of the opportunity. There are many different OEMs. First of all, you have to define what an OEM is and where they are. Some are very local, like our little boiler manufacturer in Tukkatookaland, and others are mid-sized and build in one country and sell to others regionally, perhaps only in Europe because they do not want to sell to China. Then there are the large ones, like Tetra Pak, who produce in various areas in the world and deliver everywhere, similar to Spirax. They all have different needs.

New OEMs are appearing in all industries, such as food and beverage, pharma and chemistry. There is huge potential, but you have to focus in the right area to strategically drive this. You cannot shoot anything that moves. It is very similar to the segregation of sales approach within an industry; the best way forward is identifying who to work with globally and then doing that. You also need to identify which other OEM customers to work with in local sales companies and give them guidelines on how to approach that. These are completely different ways of selling.

### Today Spirax have 71% direct sales; will that evolve or is there a ceiling?

No, because you listen to customer needs and develop new ideas and products. As long as industrial production grows, this will grow with it. Spirax-Sarco have a clear indicator of how their revenue might develop simply by looking at industrial production.

### Could direct sales percentage increase compared to distributors and re-sellers?

Yes; by finding more sales opportunities or converting distributors to a sales approach where you either work together with them or take over and stop them doing this. I am a salesperson with all my heart and believe growth is always possible, otherwise why bother? I think the Spirax direct sales approach will grow further, and that re-sellers and distributors will also grow. It all depends, but I believe direct sales revenue will grow more than re-seller's revenue, because with a direct sales approach, you can generate more which nobody was aware of before.

### If you ran the whole Spirax sales organization, what would you be worried about? What risks would you manage to ensure delivery of organic growth and target margins?

That is a long list of risk management one would need to look at. There is the people factor; you want to have the right people coming in that you can train and move up, and women are an important area in this. There are other risks you cannot prepare for, like COVID-19. It is a risk that happens but you need to find a way around, which Spirax did well. Earlier, we discussed how important it was to spend time in the plant with the customer, and in China, people did plant walks with the customer while sitting at home at their computers. They quickly worked out how to do it and got in there.

I loved that and thought it was done well. Other risks include Brexit.

### Anything specific around sales, perhaps losing control of pricing or hiring too many or too few people? Were there any operational risks on the sales side?

Yes, in theory, you can lose sight of a pricing setup, but knowing Spirax, it is highly unlikely. One of my final jobs was coming up with a pricing strategy for the whole company, so I know this is well managed. Speaking of other companies, it is very easy to lose sight and no longer have your eye on the ball, so you are absolutely right, that is an area to keep your eyes on. If I were managing sales, I would ensure new product development and keep my sales guys coming in.

Hire enough people and keep them trained, well and healthy and ensure a strategy exists so they know exactly where to go, what to say and how to generate extra sales. That is the most important thing. Do you have anything else in mind which I cannot think of?

### Looking back on your career selling these solutions, what are some principles or important lessons you would take away from that experience?

That is a lovely question. One of my early bosses once said, Maike, what do you think is the most important thing to survive and succeed in business? I thought and I said, tenacity and passion. Find out what makes your heart beat, what really makes it sing, then go for it, and be tenacious. Never give up, particularly in corporate environments where many things, including networking, are important. My recommendation would be to never give up or lose your passion.

Thank you.
