# Improve your Environment

Working in the right environment is of utmost importance. What can I do to constantly improve my personal environment?

This is true as well with relationships.
 **Hang out with people better than you, and you cannot help but improve.**
 
 Master *The psychology of human misjudgment*. Acknowledge that you cannot use the brain to override the brain, so you need to have an environment where you have fail-safe workarounds that will protect you from your weaknesses.
