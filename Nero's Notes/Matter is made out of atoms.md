# Matter is made out of Atoms

- If all the scientific knowledge of the world was erased tomorrow and we would only be able to transmit a single sentence, Feynman would choose:
 >  *Matter is made out of atoms - little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into each other.*
- This statement explains a lot of phenomena:
  - How we can change the phase of matter - *solid, liquid or gas* - by adding or removing energy to atoms  so they move more or less. The more they move, the more they escape their peers and the attraction forces are overcome - we have a gas. The less they move, the less they escape their peers and the attraction forces are predominant. We have a liquid, and then a solid.
  - Feynman explains by this sentence how for instance, to evaporate a liquid you need a fan to blow over it; or why if you want to cool your soup you can just blow on it.
