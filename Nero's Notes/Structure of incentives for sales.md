# Structure of Incentives for Sales

> Any time your create large differences in commissions where the guy gets X% for selling A, which is some mundane thing, and 10 times X for selling B, which is something toxic, you know what is going to happen. - [[Charlie Munger]]

The inevitable ubiquity of [[Incentives]] - caused bias has vast, generalized consequences. For instance, a sales force living only on commissions will be much harder to keep moral than one under less pressure from the compensation arrangement.

On the other hand, a purely commissioned sales force may well be more efficient per dollar spent. Therefore, difficult decisions involving trade-offs are common in creating compensation arrangements in the sales function.
