### Also called "Functional Equivalents"

Keith Holyoak, a UCLA professor of psychology and one of the world's leading thinkers on analogical reasoning, recommend people to ask themselves the following two questions in order to hone their skills:

- **What does this remind me of?**
- **Why does it remind me of it?**


By constantly looking at objects in your environment and material you read and asking yourself these two questions, you build the abilities in your brain to help you make connections across traditional boundaries.

Learn from history and when you later see something ask "Have I seen this before or has this happened before and what happened then? What normally happens in similar situations? Why should this be any different?"


### Learning transfer
Learning transfer is taking what we  learn in one context and applying it to another. It can be taking a kernel of what we learn in school or in a book and applying it to the "real world". It can also be taking what we learn in one industry and applying it to another.
