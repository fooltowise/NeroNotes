Not all strong brands are winners. In 1970, the US Pan Am was at its zenith. Its brand was one of the most recognized in the world, equated with glamour and adventure. This renowned brand did not guarantee superior long-term financial performance however: operating in a structurally challenging industry and buffeted by exogenous factors, the end came in 1991. From airlines to banking to newspapers and telecommunications, there are plenty of brands with superior name recognition but inferior financial performance. 

Being well-known is only one part of the equation. Successful brands offer also something differentiated, whether product, design, or image. Winning brands create an affinity, an attachment with the customer, either emotional or logical. For want of a better word, they are lover.

A company's industry plays a part: the Apple brand has its "superfans", and there are life-long devotees of brands like Louis Vuitton, but we are not aware of similar appreciation groups for Air France or Delta Airlines - or Bank of America or HSBC. 

Differentiation and customer attachment allows for premium pricing and potentially gains in market share (the link between these two patterns and brand is strong). Often such brands have non-replicable heritage and have endured over time.
