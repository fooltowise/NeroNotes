# My Investing Strategy

See also [[Long-Term Focus]], [[Long term investing]]


From what I can read, It looks like most equity analysts and institutional investors have a very short-term focus, where they try to predict what will happen to a stock within the next six months (the book *Best Practices for Equity Research Analysts* was an eye-opener. I suspected this was the case, I just didn't know it was this bad).

I am convinced that the smart thing to do is to take the opposite view: have an extremely long-term investment horizon, so that I can let compound interest do its magic. Add to this that the human brain [[When the brain thinks logarithmically|thinks logarithmically]] (that's most likely due to Weber's law), and most market participants are likely to mis-price long-term compounders. That's an interesting parallel with what [[Nick Sleep and Qais Zakaria]] wrote in [[The Equity Yield Curve]].


So how do I find those long-term compounders?

## Business Model
I will need to find extremely resilient business models, with a very high return on re-invested capital. Some example are:

- Be the toll bridge of the economy ([[Visa]], Mastercard, Moody's, Standard & Poor's, MSCI,...)
- [[Scale Economics Shared]] (Amazon, Costco ...)
- Serial acquirer with a decentralized organization and an excellent capital allocator at the helm. 

## Management
Management will have to think extremely long term as well. As a result, the management team needs to have a big equity stake in the business to align their interest with shareholders. Family businesses are even better, they are able to suffer short-term pain to get long-term growth.

Management's quality of thinking of  is very important, some landmarks are Mark Leonard, Buffett, Jeff Bezos.

If I plan to be invested for the very-long term, **capital allocation is of utmost importance**. Most of my gains will come from the reinvestment of returns. I need an extremely clear picture of how management thinks about capital allocation. Some will describe it explicitly in their shareholder letters, but for others I will have to check management's history of capital allocation.


## Stakeholders
- What is management doing to strengthen its relationship with customers? Employees? Suppliers?
