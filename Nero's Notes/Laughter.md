# Laughter

## From *The Elephant in the Brain* by Kevin Simler & Robin Hanson

Humans have laughter. But not *just* laughter - we also use smiling, exaggerated body movements, awkward facial expressions (like winking), and a high-pitched, giddy "play scream". All of these signals mean roughly the same thing: "We're just playing." This message allows us to coordinate *safe social play* with other humans, especially when we're playing in ways that hint at or border on real danger.

We can actually distinguish two closely related meanings of laughter, depending on the context. When we laugh at our own actions, it's a signal to our playmates that our *intentions* are ultimately playful (although we may seem aggressive). This is the kind of laugh a young child might give after play hitting an adult or other child, or that adults five when they're gently poking fun at someone. It's the behavioral equivalent of "Just Kidding!"  or a winking emoji at the end of a text message. When we laugh in response to *someone else's* actions, however, it's a statement not about intentions but about perceptions. It says, "I perceive your actions as playful; I know you're only kidding around." This is a reactive laughter, the kind elicited in response to an external stimulus. Jokes and other forms of humor are one such stimulus, but being tickled, chased, or surprised in a game of peekaboo all work the same way.

Both uses of laughter function as reassurances: "In spite of what might seem serious of dangerous, I'm still feeling playful." And the "**in spite of**" clause is important. We don't laugh continuously throughout a play session, only when there's something potentially unpleasant to react to. Like all acts of communication, laughter must strive to be relevant. When it's obvious that everyone is safe and happy - while quietly playing Monopoly, for example - there's no need to belabor the obvious. We need to reinforce that "we're just playing" only when circumstances arise which might, if not for the laughter, be mistaken for too serious or dangerous.

This helps explain why an element of danger is so important for getting a laugh. Now, danger isn't strictly required - we sometimes laugh at harmless wordplay, for example. But danger certainly helps. A pun is a lot funnier when it's a sexual double-entendre told in the presence of children ("How many flies does it take to screw in a light bulb? Two.") And when there's not enough danger, attempts at humor often fall flat. The comic strips *Marmaduke* and *The Family Circus*, for instance, are so timid and toothless (to many sensibilities) as to be considered boring.

#### Kevin fires a shotgun
> The first time I fired a shotgun and felt the recoil, I started laughing - somewhat hysterically, in fact. I realize that makes me sound crazy, but here's what I think happened. A firearm is a taboo object in my culture. I was raised without any contact with guns, and so when I fired one as an adult at a shooting range, I was already perched at the psychological boundary between safety and danger. Then, given the surprise of the blast and the violent recoil, I was plunged into terror for a fraction of a second - not unlike the initial jump of a skydiver. But I quickly realized that I was perfectly safe, and my brain's response to all this, evidently, was to laugh - to let my friends know that I felt safe and comfortable, and that I wanted to try it again.


The play-signal theory also explains many of the instances when we *don't* laugh. When a clown trips and falls down the stairs, you might chuckle, knowing that he's just playing and he is actually OK. But when your aging grandmother stumbles and falls, everything is decidedly *not* OK; her accident represents acute danger. It's only after you've rushed to her side and discovered that she's perfectly safe that *maybe* it becomes reasonable to laugh about the situation - especially if she starts laughing first. In fact, the logic of laughter explains why her laughter is likely to trigger yours, rather than the other way around. If she laughs first, it means she feels safe, so you can feel safe too. But if you laugh first, she's liable to take offense. How could you feel safe when she hasn't given the "all clear" (you insensitive clod)? It must mean you don't really care what happens to her.

## The dark side of laughter
As we mentioned earlier, people are profoundly ignorant about laughter's meaning and purpose (at least in our default state, before learning the science). But where does this ignorance comes from? Why does introspection fail so spectacularly here?

It's not simply because laughter is involuntary, outside our conscious control. Flinching, for example, is also involuntary, and yet we understand perfectly well why we do it: to protect ourselves from getting hit. Thus our ignorance about *laughter* needs further explanation.

As we've hinted, such ignorance may be strategic; our brains may be trying to hide something. And yet the meaning of laughter -"We're playing!" - seems entirely innocent and aboveboard.

Perhaps it is not what laughter is that makes us uncomfortable, but rather how we use it. In this regard, laughter is like money. It doesn't bother us to "admit" that money is a medium of exchange, but we might well be embarrassed to reveal our credit card statements to the entire world. When the *New York Times* reported that Target can predict whether a woman is pregnant simply by analyzing her recent purchases, it caused quite a stir among privacy advocates, for obvious reasons. Similarly, if our brains kept a log of all the specific situations that ever jiggled a laugh out of us, we might be just as nervous about opening those records up for the world to inspect. As Provine points out, "Laughter... is a powerful probe into social relationships." but often we don't want to be probed. We crave privacy an plausible deniability, and our natural ignorance about laughter may provide just the cover we need.
To understand what laughter reveals (that we might prefer to keep hidden), we need to consider two important factors: norms and psychological distance.

### Norms

As young children, most of our play concerns the physical world. And what we laugh at is similarly physical or physiological. Common triggers for laughter among infants and toddlers include mock aggression (tickling, chasing), mock danger (being thrown in the air by a caretaker) and carefully crafted surprises (peekaboo).

As we age, however, we start paying more attention to the *social* world and its attendant dangers, many of which revolve around [[Norms]]. When we violate a norm, we have to worry about getting caught and punished. And when someone else seems to violate a norm, we have to ask ourselves, "Is this a threat? Do I have to step in and regulate?" Our actions in these situations carry real risks. If we misstep, we might face disapproval from our peers or censure from authority figures or worse.

But where there's danger, there's also an opportunity for exploratory play. And just as the physical danger of a roller coaster tickles our physiological funny bone, flirting with norm-related danger tickles our social funny bone.

Consider a five-year-old girl who finds potty humor hilarious. She knows it's rude to perform (or talk about) certain bodily functions in front of others, and that she risks being punished if she does. But at the same time, she can't take every rule at face value; she needs to probe her boundaries. Just how serious are these norms, really? If she soils her pants, of course, she may feel legitimately ashamed - and thus, no laughter. But if she merely farts, she'll quickly learn that the danger is quite small; her parents may scowl, but they're not going to send her to her room. And this realization - that farting can be safe, even though it's officially discouraged - is liable to provoke some laughter. And a whoopie cushion may be even funnier to the young girl, since it produces only *fake* fart noises, and is entirely benign.

At some point during her development, however, she'll exhaust the learning opportunities around bodily norms, and they'll cease to be a fertile source of play. And soon she'll graduate to the grown-up world, where we're concerned mostly with social, sexual, and moral norms. These are an endless source of fascination, in part because there are so many of them, with so many nuances, that we can never hope to learn all of their boundaries and edge cases. But they're also fascinating because they're always shifting around  as circumstances and attitudes change. Just as guides to etiquette need to be refreshed every few years, so too must our humor evolve to keep up with changing norms. What was once a sweet spot for comedy can evolve into a genuine sore spot, a cultural bruise - or vice versa. The shifting political landscape can neuter what was once a deadly serious accusation ("Commie!"), turning it into a playful insult. Tech innovations, such as the cell phone, turn old norms upside down and force new ones to come into being. Only some of these norms are ever written down - and when they are, they're often obsolete as soon as the ink dry. They vary widely across different communities and contexts. And sometimes, as with sexual norms, they're uncomfortable to discuss in precise terms or in serious settings. All of those factors make them ripe for play, and therefore laughter.

In the broadest sense, there are at least two ways to use the danger of norms for comedic effect. The first is to feint across the norm boundary, but then retreat back to safety without actually violating it. The second way is to step across the boundary, violating the norm, and then to realize, like a child jumping into snow for the first time, "It's safe over here! Whee!"

Here, for example, is a joke that flirts with, but doesn't actually consume, a norm violation:

MARY: What do you call a black man flying a plane?
JOHN: Uh, I don't know...
MARY: A pilot. What did you think, you racist?!

The humor here plays off the norm against racism. After Mary's setup, John starts to squirm uncomfortably, afraid his friend is about to tell an offensive joke. But when Mary delivers the punchline, it's sweet, safe relief. She wasn't telling a racist joke after all. She was just playing! And a hearty chuckle ensues.

This joke uses the norm against racism only to provide the sense of danger, and achieves safety (and laughter) by *not* violating it. In this way, the joke ultimately reinforces the norm. But other jokes don't pull back from norm violation, and must achieve safety by other means, which often subverts the norms that they're playing with.

In September 2012, for example, the French satirical magazine *Charlie Hebdo* published irreverent cartoons of the prophet Muhammad, including a few nude caricatures. While many secular liberals found the cartoons humorous, some fundamentalist Muslims most definitely did not. These divergent attitudes are a reflection of how seriously each group treats the norms against mocking religion (in general) or depicting Muhammad (in particular). Secularists feel that such norms shouldn't have much sway in public life, while fundamentalists would like them to be enshrined as law.

What our brains choose to laugh at, then, reveals a lot about our true feelings in morally charged situations. It says, "I realize something is supposedly considered wrong here, but I'm not taking it seriously." If we laugh at cartoon drawings of Muhammad, our brains reveal that we're only weakly committed to the norm in question. What seems like a mere cartoon is actually a proxy for much deeper issues.

A real danger of laughter, then, is the fact that we don't all share the same norms to the same degree. What's sacred to one person can be an object of mere play to another. And so when we laugh at norm violations, it often serves to weaken the norms that others may wish to uphold. This helps explain why people charged with maintaining the highest standards of propriety - schoolmarms, religious leaders, the guardians in *Plato*'s republic, the Chinese officials who banned puns in 2014 - have an interest in tamping down on laughter and humor.

When two people laugh at the same joke for the same reasons, it brings them closer together. But when we laugh at another persons' sacred cow, it ceases to be all fun and games.


### Psychological distance

The other kind of sensitive information our brains "leak" through laughter is how we feel toward those who become the objects of our comedy, the butts of our jokes. The less we care about people, the easier is it to laugh when bad things happen to them.

Actually two variables are important here. The first is, simply, *how much pain* is involved. We're more likely to laugh at a pinprick than at a broken bone, and more likely to laugh at a broken bone than a violent death.

The second variable is *psychological distance*. When people are "farther" from us, psychologically, we're slower to empathize with them, and more likely to laugh at their pain. "Tragedy," says Mel Brooks, "is when I cut my finger. Comedy is when *you* walk into an open sewer and die."

According to this measure, friends are closer than acquaintances, who in turn are closer than enemies. But our perception of psychological distance depends on many other factors. For example, events that take place in the make-believe space of fiction are more psychologically distant than events that happen in real life, and cartoon comedies is more psychologically remote than recent history. In an episode of *South Park*, the characters joke about whether enough time has passed for AIDS to be considered funny. Or as Carol Burnett said, "Comedy is tragedy plus time."

Together these two variables determine how much pain we feel, sympathetically, upon learning about someone else's misfortune. When someone close to us suffers terribly, we feel it in our marrow; *it hurts*. But when a distant stranger suffers only a scratch, it hardly registers for us. In between, of course, are all the interesting edge cases: a close friend who spills wine on her lap, or a second-cousin who breaks his arm doing something stupid. Whether or how hard we laugh at such edge cases says a lot about our relationship to the person experiencing pain.

Imagine a group of three popular middle-school girls standing by their lockers in the hallway. One of their unpopular classmates, Maggie, walks by and trips, spilling her books and papers everywhere - and the popular girls start pointing and laughing.

Clearly this laughter is rude, perhaps even aggressive. When someone gets hurt, the humane response is to break from a playful mood into a serious mood, to make sure they're OK. The popular girls' laughter, then, reveals that they don't take Maggie's suffering seriously. They're treating her pain as an object of play - a mere plaything.

Note that this is not a different kind of laughter than the kind we saw earlier. It means the same thing: "In spite of what just happened, I'm feeling safe." Or "I realize something is supposedly wrong here, but it doesn't bother me." It's the *context* that makes the laughter rude and means-spirited.

Now, we need to be careful how we moralize about what these popular girls  are doing. It would be easy to condemn them for laughing at the misfortune of another human being. But that's not the real problem; we all laugh at other people in this way. Consider the *Darwin Awards*,  a website that "commemorates those who improve our gene pool by removing themselves from it." It's a catalog of gruesome deaths (usually involving irony, stupidity, or both), played entirely for laughs. But although the accidents described in the *Darwin Awards* are vastly more serious than Maggie's stumble, we find it funny because the victims are strangers, and thus their pain doesn't register as serious for us. For better or worse, this is how we are wired.

To give an even more disturbing example, consider how often we joke and laugh about prison rape - "Don't drop the soap!" for example. On sober reflection, we may realize these jokes are distasteful, if not morally odious; rape should be universally condemned, no matter who the victims are. And yet, when the victims are convicted criminals, our brains don't send us the same "Danger!" signals that they would send if the victims were innocent citizens. People behind bars are remote, both socially and psychologically, and we tend not to empathize with them to the same degree we empathize with our friends and neighbors.

When the popular girls laugh at Maggie, then, their brains are running the same algorithm that ours are running when we laugh at prison rape or the *Darwin awards.*

If we insist on moralizing about what the popular girls are doing, we should focus on the fact that their laughter itself contributes to further suffering. Most of us strive to laugh only in situations where our laughter is harmless, or even (on occasion) helpful. When a friend spills wine on her shirt, we want to laugh, ideally, only after she's given us the "all clear" by laughing herself. Or we might take a risk and laugh preemptively, hoping that our laughter will help her to appreciate the non-seriousness of the situation. But such laughter needs to be very gentle indeed, and we'll want to back off if she shows any sign of taking offense, lest our laughter be the cause of further suffering.


Teasing hinges on a similar dynamic. To tease is to provoke a small amount of suffering in a playful manner, often accompanied by laughter. The interesting cases lie between *good-natured teasing*, which strengthens a relationship, and *mean-natured teasing*, which weakens it. Teasing is good-natured when it provokes only light suffering, and when the offense is offset by enough warmth and affinity that the person being teased generally feels more loved than ridiculed. The fact that it's hard to tease strangers - because there's no preexisting warmth to help mitigate the offense - means that the people we tease are necessarily close to us. Knowing and sensing this is partly what gives teasing its power to bring people closer together.

Teasing can become mean-spirited, however, when it provokes too much suffering, or when it's not offset with enough good, warm feelings. And when there's no affinity whatsoever, teasing turns into bullying or simple abuse. This kind of bullying can be especially effective (for the bully) or frustrating (for the victim), because the bully has a built-in excuse: "I'm only kidding! Can't you take a joke?"


It's worth reiterating that our brains do most of this on autopilot. We rarely make conscious calculations about the strength of our relationships, or how much suffering is to much to laugh at - but our brains perform these calculations all the same, automatically and unconsciously. As Provine points out, it's precisely because laughter is involuntary that it's such a powerful probe into social relationships.

Thus we use laughter to gauge and calibrate social boundaries - both behavioral boundaries (norms) and group membership boundaries (who deserves how much of our empathy). But this calibration is a delicate art. We need deniability.

### Deniability

> The meaning of a wink depends on it not being common knowledge - Michael Chwe

Try to imagine (or remember) what it's like to be a wide-eyed 14-year-old anxious to learn about sex. Beyond the basic mechanics covered in sex education, the topic has remained pretty murky for you, and you have a lot of pressing questions. When are you allowed to talk about sex? How explicit can you be in front of different audiences (friends, grandparents, younger children, mixed company)? Which aspects of sex are truly dangerous, and which are merely taboo? Which practices are considered appropriate versus slightly deviant versus beyond the pale?

Amid all this uncertainty, it's clear that the adults aren't giving you the full story. So where should you turn?

One thing you've noticed is that while the adults may not talk openly about sex, they're willing and even eager to joke about it. So if you keep your ears open and pay careful attention, you might be able to glean enough hints to piece together a reasonably accurate picture.

You might be especially intrigued, for example, by the *Seinfield* episode *The Contest* in which characters wager to see who can hold out the longest without masturbating. The dialog is careful to dance around the actual word "masturbate", but you weren't born yesterday; you know what they're talking about. And the fact that masturbation is played for *laughs* tells you most of what you need to know about the topic: first, that it's a taboo, not something you want to talk about in front of grandma; and second, that it's commonplace and more or less acceptable, at least in the eyes of mainstream TV-watching Americans. Society may not fully condone it, but it won't get you labeled a deviant. It's a norm violation, but also benign.

Laughter, then, shows us the boundaries that language is too shy to make explicit. In this way, humor can be extremely useful for exploring the boundaries of the social world. The sparks of laughter illuminate what is otherwise murky and hard to pin down with precision: the threshold between safety and danger, between what's appropriate and what's transgressive, between who does and doesn't deserve your empathy. In fact, what laughter illustrates is precisely the fact that our norms and other social boundaries aren't etched in stone with black-and-white precision, but ebb and shift through shades of gray, depending on context.

For this task, language just doesn't cut it. It's too precise, too quotable, too much "on the record" - all of which can be stifling and oppressive, especially when stated norms are too strict. In order to communicate in this kind of environment, we (clever primates) turn to a medium that gives us "wiggle room" to squirm out of an accusation, to defy sticklers who would try to hold us accountable.

Laughter may not be nearly as expressive as language, but it has two properties that make it ideal for navigating sensitive topics. First, it's relatively honest. With words, it's too easy to pay lip service to rules we don't really care about, or values that we don't genuinely feel in our gut. But laughter, because it's involuntary, doesn't lie - at least not as much. "*In risu veritas*", said James Joyce; "In laughter, there is truth." Second, laughter is deniable. In this way, it gives us safe harbor, an easy out. When someone accuses us of laughing inappropriately, it's easy to brush off. "Oh, I didn't really understand what she meant", we might demur. Or, "Come on, lighten up! It was only a joke!" And we can deliver these denials with great conviction because we really don't have a clear understanding of what our laughter means or why we find funny things funny. Our brains just figure it out, without burdening us with too many damning details.

The comedian Bill Burr has preemptively used the word "lighten up" defense on a number of occasions. On the topic of comedians getting attacked for their jokes, Burr said:

> I'm worried every time I see a comedian apologize. [Addressing a hypothetical attacker]: Just because you took what I said seriously doesn't mean I mean it. You don't get to decide that you're in my head and that you know my intent. If I'm joking, I'm joking.

In other interview he says: "I don't tink it's fair to get offended by comedians." And yet what fans say they love about Burr is that he's honest - "refreshingly, brutally, devastatingly honest".
So which is it? Is he just joking or telling the truth?

The beauty of laughter is that it gets to be both. The safe harbor of plausible deniability is what allows Burr and other comedians to get away with being honest about taboo topics. As Oscar Wilde said, "If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh; otherwise they'll kill you."
