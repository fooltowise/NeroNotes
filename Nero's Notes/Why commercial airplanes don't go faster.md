Commercial airplanes are usually rated for a given number of cycles. A cycle means a takeoff and a landing. 

That means that except for the fuel, the cost of flying a plane is fixed: it is the purchase price of the plane divided by the number of cycles the plane is rated for. This fixed cost can then be distributed over the total number of seats.

Fuel costs on the other hand depend a lot on the engine efficiency and the speed of the plane. Most commercial plane engines are turbofans which are optimized to be most efficient just below the speed of sound. 

If you want to go sustainably faster, you would need a turboreactor (turbojet), which consumes much more fuel.

As the speed get closer to the speed of sound, the air flow around the plane  creates a drag which leads the engines to consume a lot of fuel. This drag is present from a bit before to a bit after the speed of sound. 

As a result, most commercial airplanes have a speed limit which prevents them to get too close to the speed of sound so they don't consume too much fuel.


Airlines do not care about how fast their plane fly. What they care about is how much does it cost to perform a flight, and most of the variable costs come from the fuel. Therefore most turbofan are optimized to consume the least possible fuel just below the speed of sound.
