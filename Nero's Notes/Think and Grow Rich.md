# Think and Grow Rich

Ideas about the [[Unconscious Mind]]

## Desire

You need to start with a *burning* desire.

The method by which *desire* for riches can be transmuted into its financial equivalent, consists of six definite, practical steps, viz:

1. Fix in your mind the *exact* amount of money you desire. It is not sufficient merely to say "I want plenty of money". Be definite as to the amount. 
2. Determine exactly what you intend to five in return for the money you desire (There is no such reality as "something for nothing").
3. Establish a definite date when you intend to possess the money you desire.
4. Establish a definite plan for carrying out your desire, and begin at once, whether you are ready or not, to put this plan into practice.
5. Write out a clear, concise statement of the amount of money you intend to acquire, name the time limit for its acquisition, state what you intend to five in return for the money, and describe clearly the plan through which you intend to accumulate it.
6. Read your written statement aloud, twice daily, once just before retiring at night, and once after arising in the morning. *As you read - see and feel and believe yourself already in possession of the money.*

## Faith
### Self-confidence formula

1. I know that i have the ability to achieve the object of my Definite Purpose in life, therefore, I *demand* of myself persistent, continuous action toward its attainment, and I here and now promise to render such action.
2. I realize the dominating thoughts of my mind will eventually reproduce themselves in outward, physical action, and gradually transform themselves into physical reality, therefore, I will concentrate my thoughts for thirty minutes daily, upon the task of thinking of the person I intend to become, thereby creating in my mind a clear mental picture of that person.
3. I know through the principle of auto-suggestion, any desire that I persistently hold in my mind will eventually seek expression through some practical means of attaining the object back of it, therefore, I will devote ten minutes daily to demanding of myself the development of *self-confidence*.
4. I have clearly written down a description of my *definite chief aim in life*, and I will never stop trying, until I shall have developed sufficient self-confidence for its attainment.
5. I fully realize that no wealth or position can long endure, unless built upon truth and justice, therefore, I will engage in no transaction which does not benefit all whom it affects. I will succeed by attracting to myself the forces I wish to use, and the cooperation of other people. I will induce others to serve me, because of my willingness to serve others. I will eliminate hatred, envy, jealousy, selfishness, and cynicism, by developing love for all humanity, because I know that a negative attitude toward others can never bring me success. I will cause others to believe in me, because I will believe in them, and in myself.
I will sign my name to this formula, commit it to memory, and repeat it aloud once a day, with full *faith* that it will gradually influence my thoughts and actions so that I will become a self-reliant, and successful person. 


## Auto Suggestion

1. Go into some quiet spot (preferably in bed at night) where you will not be disturbed or interrupted, close your eyes, and repeat aloud (so you may hear your own words) the written statement of the money you intend to accumulate, the time limit for its accumulation, and a description of the service or merchandise you intend to give in return for the money. As you carry out these instructions, *see yourself already in possession of the money.*
2. Repeat this program night and morning until you can see, in your imagination, the money you intend to accumulate.
3. Place a written copy of your statement where you can see it night and morning, and read it just before retiring, and upon arising until it has been memorized.
