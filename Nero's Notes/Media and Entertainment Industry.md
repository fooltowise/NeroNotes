# Media and Entertainment Industry

## Sector Synopsis

Media and entertainment is a ubiquitous and fast-growing sector that includes many companies in various sub-sectors, such as cable and radio, telecommunication, movies and TV, Internet services providers, and, of course, print newspapers and magazines. The main characteristics of this sector are a high rate of innovation (wireless technology, social media), frequent technological disruptions (online information services rattling print media), low barriers to entry, and relatively easy penetration of foreign markets, all enhancing cut-throat competition within the sub-sectors. Customers are the most important strategic asset of media and entertainment companies, particularly because in most sub-sectors, the customers’ identity is known to the provider of services (Internet service providers; cable, satellite radio, and telecom companies; newspaper and magazine publish- ers; etc.), enabling active management of the customer franchise. Indeed, customer management is a prime driver of competitive advantage in this sector. Other strategic assets are legal rights and licenses (cellular spectrum, TV licenses), content (movies, TV serials), and unique business processes (e.g., Netflix’s and Amazon’s customer recommendation algorithms).

Achieving sustained competitive advantage in media and entertainment is a major challenge due to fierce competition and low entry barriers. Accordingly, detailed information on companies’ strategic resources, their vulnerabilities, deployment, and productivity is essential for investors and lenders to make successful investment decisions and monitor managers. That’s indeed the gist of most analysts’ questions in the sector’s many conference calls that we examined. Conventional accounting and financial reports in this sec- tor are particularly deficient, since most investments in strategic resources are immediately expensed (brand creation, customer acquisition costs, business processes) and, therefore, absent from the balance sheet, while other assets (cellular spectrum) are presented at historical, mostly outdated values. And, of course, given the integrated structure of financial reports, when the balance sheet is flawed, so too is the income statement. For example, the reported earnings of growing media and entertainment companies are seriously understated due to the expensing of large investments in strategic assets (customer acquisition costs, brand creation). Overall, the usefulness of accounting-based financial reports in this dynamic, fast-changing sector is marginal, as clearly evidenced by the limited attention of analysts in conference calls to the companies’ reported assets, earnings and other accounting performance indicators.

Enter the proposed Strategic Resources & Consequences Report. For clarity, this Report will first be demonstrated on a specific company—Sirius XM—to highlight the unique investor insights offered by our proposal, fol- lowed by the outline of a general Resources & Consequences Report for media and entertainment companies.

## Sirius XM - Resources & Consequences Report

Sirius XM is the major provider of satellite radio services in North America— more than 20 percent of all cars in the United States carry Sirius’s services. The company creates and broadcasts commercial-free music, comedies, talk and sports shows, as well as some live events. It also provides GPS and weather information. Recently, Sirius started providing Internet radio for connected devices, and telematic, two-way services for connected vehicles, for security (accident reporting) and convenience (restaurant location) purposes. Sirius satellite radios are primarily distributed through car makers and dealers. The company, which was founded in 1990, had about 21 million paying subscribers in 2014, and among its main draws is the notorious Howard Stern show with its endearing call-in number: 1–888–9ASSHOLE.

Sirius’s income statement for the second quarter ending June 30, 2013, tells a solid, but somewhat uninspiring story: Total revenues grew 4.8 percent from the earlier quarter ($940 million vs. $897 million), while net income inched up a mere 1.5 percent. How, then, to explain the CEO’s ecstatic open- ing of the quarter’s conference call with investors: “Sirius XM turned in an extraordinary second quarter that was marked by a number of new records and milestones”? A 1.5 percent earnings increase being called a “milestone”? Is this just hype? Or, perhaps, as we argue all along, accounting numbers don’t tell the real story.

## Subscribers Growth

Let’s examine Sirius’s Resources & Consequences Report in Figure 12.1. This report was not, of course, produced by Sirius. It’s a demonstration of our proposed Resources & Consequences Report based primarily on non-accounting data disclosed voluntarily by Sirius in its earnings presentations, answers to analysts’ questions, and other sources. Sirius’s main strategic resource is its customers, or subscribers, see the SUBSCRIBERS box in the Strategic Resources column (second from left). The data inform that Sirius managed to acquire 2.7 million new customers in the quarter—a record—amounting to an 8 percent increase from the previous quarter. Customer termination, 1.9 million, while substantial, was lower than in the earlier quarter (2.1 million customers). The net customer gain—over 700,000 subscribers—was also a record. The icing on the cake: The churn rate (monthly rate of cancellations) decreased nicely to 1.7 percent from 2.0 percent. Note that this non-GAAP customer information portrays a different, more positive, performance picture than the anemic 1.5 percent earnings growth—particularly the substantial increase in new subscribers and the churn rate decrease—providing a certain justification for the CEO’s cheerful opening of the conference call. Importantly, the SUBSCRIBERS box provides a comprehensive insight into the company’s major strategic asset: development during the quarter, as well as end-of-quarter position.

As there is generally no free lunch, the 2.7-million (gross) customer increase came at a cost: The Resource Development column (left hand) tells us that total subscriber acquisition costs increased from $127 million to $139 million in the second quarter, a 9.4 percent rise, translated to an increase in acquisition cost per new subscriber, from $51 to $52. These costs include commissions paid to automakers as incentives to purchase and activate satellite radios (carrying Sirius) in new cars, and subsidies to radio manufacturers to install satellite service. As the Report shows, other customer acquisition costs, like sales & marketing (divided by total customers), were almost flat in the second quarter. So, from a cost–benefit perspective, the net gain of 700,000 new subscribers in the second quarter came at a relatively low price, particularly considering that, in contrast with accounting procedures, this cost isn’t a period expense, rather an investment (asset), providing a stream of future monthly subscription revenues. Given Sirius’s annual subscription charge of about $180, the 700,000 net new customers will cover the $139 million acquisition costs in a little over a year, and the low churn rate (1.7 percent per month) indicates that the new customers will stay with Sirius for almost five years, on average, yielding a considerable gain over acquisition costs.

**INVESTOR’S INSIGHT**

Note how the information in the Resources & Consequences Report allows users: (1) to relate costs (customer acquisition) to benefits (customer growth), (2) to assess the return on investment in franchise building, and (3) to evaluate the success of the customer strategy of Sirius. It is not possible to glean any of this information from accounting-based financial reports, and none of it is really competition-sensitive, precluding disclosure.


This leads us to the bigger question: How did Sirius manage to gain a substantial number of subscribers without a commensurate increase in sales & marketing expenses? Managerial mojo? Howard Stern magic? Not entirely. The second quarter of 2013 saw a substantial increase in new-car sales in the United States. In fact, 2013 was the best car sales year (over 15 million new cars sold) since the low of 2007. Given Sirius’s high new-car installation rate—almost 70 percent (see the Report’s Resource Deployment column)—much of the subscribers rise in the second quarter was driven by the increase in new car sales and didn’t require substantial marketing expenses. But the high installation rate in new cars is obviously driven by Sirius’s strategy. This, then, turns the spotlight to the marketing strategy of installing Sirius service in new and used cars.

## It's the strategy, stupid

So, what is Sirius’s strategy? How did it get nearly 21 million paying sub- scribers to its services by 2014? And is this strategy sustainable—namely, does it confer a sustained competitive advantage? These are key questions for investors (and managers, too). Don’t look at the financial reports for answers to these fundamental questions. All you’ll find is that Sirius’s second-quarter total revenues were $940 million. But which managerial strategies and actions yielded these revenues, and which failed? That information is nowhere to be found. Reporting consequences (revenues) without causes is one of the major limitations of accounting-based information. Obviously, without a thorough understanding of Sirius’s strategy—its business model—no reliable assessment can be made about manager’s performance and the sustainability of current revenues. No wonder that in Sirius’s four 2013 quarterly conference calls that we studied there was not a single analyst question about revenues or earnings, but many questions about strategy. That’s what matters.

Absent a comprehensive strategy articulation, we managed to cobble up parts of Sirius’s strategy from multiple sources, including management presentations and answers to analysts’ questions, as well as media sources, and present it in the Resource Deployment column of the Resources & Con- sequences Report (second column from right). This column summarizes in bullet points the focal points of Sirius’s strategy—marketing initiatives and new products—highlighted by performance data (Marketing Record box). In the real Resources & Consequences Report, these strategic indicators would be the basis for a comprehensive discussion of the strategy by management, emphasizing challenges and new initiatives, and elaborated on in the narrative section of the Report (depicted by circles).

As indicated in the Resource Deployment column of the Report, Sirius’s marketing strategy revolves around new and used cars. Agreements with car manufacturers to install a six-month trial Sirius service in new cars are very successful (69 percent penetration rate, see Marketing Record). Growth can thus be expected from increases in new car sales (beyond Sirius’s control) and an increase in penetration rate. But, at currently almost 70 percent, large penetration gains will be hard to come by, as indicated by the relatively stable 2012–2013 penetration record. The used car market is substantially larger, but more dispersed and difficult to target. Here, Sirius’s efforts are aimed at new car sellers offering preowned (euphemism for “used”) cars, as well as used car dealers—but those numbers are in the thousands. Agreements to install Sirius’s services are also reached with certain dealers servicing used cars. This three-pronged strategy—new, used, and car servicing—is the marketing strategy pursued by Sirius’s manage- ment. How successful is this strategy? As the quantitative information in the Marketing Record box indicates, the new car penetration rate is high (close to 70 percent), but rather stable, indicating that this rate is close to maturation. Growth can come from increased conversion rate (subscribers who sign for a paid service after the trial period, unlike one of the authors), but this rate is stuck at 45 percent, apparently at a steady state, too.

This leaves the challenging used-car market as the major potential growth driver. But here, too, the stability of the overall penetration rate over 2012−2013—around 20 percent for all cars—indicates significant challenges in the used-car market. All in all, subscribers’ growth is undoubtedly the toughest challenge facing Sirius, and it obviously weighs heavily on investors: Despite a rise in the first half of 2013, Sirius’s stock remained rather flat since then, lagging the overall market. Now you know why.

Growth, of course, can also come from exciting new products and services. Indeed, in answers to analysts’ questions, Sirius’s managers mentioned several products under development (Sirius XM 2.0, mySXM), as well as development of original programs and telematic services (two-way convenience and security services). How serious is Sirius’s commitment to product development? Lack of data makes this hard to know, but an examination of the CONTENT and ENGINEERING boxes in the Resource Develop- ment column (left hand) of the Report isn’t reassuring. Expenditures on programming and content are rather low ($2.9 per subscriber vs. $2.8 for sales & marketing), and are not growing. R&D expenditures (engineering, design, and development), at $0.6 per customer, are also low. Management obviously keeps a tight lid on costs, which contributes nicely to account- ing earnings ($377 million in 2013), but such tight lid apparently comes at the expense of product development and other growth initiatives. It is questionable, therefore, whether new products will provide considerable revenue boost. Growth is undoubtedly Sirius’s Achilles’ heel.

**INVESTOR’S INSIGHT**

Note how the information in the Strategic Resources and the Resource Deployment columns of the Report enable an in-depth analysis of Sirius’s strategy, its execution, and the drawing of inferences about future growth. You now have the information needed for a long-term invest- ment decision.

## Disruption Threat

Absent obvious considerable growth prospects, is Sirius’s dominant position assured? On the bright side, Sirius’s brand is well known; it’s practically the only game in town for satellite radio, it has a large and slowly grow- ing subscriber base, and it features some big-name exclusive artists. It seems impregnable. And yet, as the Resource Preservation column of the Report suggests, in this industry with fast-changing technologies and low barriers to entry, competitive and disruption threats can never be dismissed. Indeed, the media carry occasional articles on threats to Sirius’s dominance,5 and many of analysts’ questions in Sirius’s conference calls revolved around potential competition. The main concerns focus on an Internet strategy as an alter- native to satellite radio—wi-fi in the car—and the entry of “big players,” like Apple and Google into the car streaming market. In answer to analysts’ persistent questions about threats from disruption and competition, Sirius’s managers talked somewhat obliquely about developing a double strategy for Sirius: satellite and Internet. But they were obviously reluctant to get into details, and the very low R&D expenditures do not indicate a concerted investment in innovation. This doesn’t build investor confidence. The extent to which Sirius will be able, in the long run, to maintain its overwhelming competitive advantage against the likes of Apple, Google, and others aiming at the lucrative wi-fi-in-the-car market is still an open and challenging question. Long-term investors should clearly focus on this issue, and seek more information from management and the board.

## Value Created

This brings us to the last aspect of the Resources & Consequences Report—the actual value created during the quarter by Sirius’s strategies (right-hand column). Our computation of value created deviates significantly from accounting-based earnings. As outlined in Chapter 11, we start with Cash Provided by Operating Activities, to abstract from managerial estimates, projections, and occasional manipulations (cash flows are much harder to manipulate than earnings): $273 million in Q2–2013 for Sirius XM (see top righthand box in the Report). We add back investments that were expensed in the income statement (and thereby affect cash flows): Programming & Content, Design & Development: $85 million. We further subtract capital expenditures: $37 million, and a quarterly charge for cost of equity capital: $91 million. Total value created by operations in Q2–2013 at Sirius is thus $230 million.

Abstracting from the unusually low value created in Q1-2013 ($174 million), a $230 million quarterly value created seems representative, a reasonable value, even relative to Sirius’s market value of roughly $20 billion. Sirius is clearly a consistent value-creating business.

Finally, we provide a new indicator: an estimate of the lifetime value of Sirius’s subscriber franchise—the main strategic asset of the company. This is important, since the value created computed above (as well as accounting earnings) does not include changes in strategic asset values, which are part and parcel of value added. A convenient way to approximate franchise value is to compute the monthly margin per subscriber (monthly revenue-per-subscriber minus operating costs) and multiply it by the inverse of the churn rate. This is the lifetime value of one subscriber; multiplying it by the total number of subscribers yields the overall lifetime subscriber value (assuming no significant subscriber growth). For the second quarter of 2013, this value was $8.38 billion (see Report), an almost 30 percent growth from a year earlier, and a considerable part of the total market value of Sirius (roughly $20 billion in 2013), dwarfing the balance sheet book (equity) value of $3.2 billion.

## A reality Check

It is important to note that our analysis of Sirius was constrained by the limited strategic information we were able to collect from informal sources. A real-life application of our proposed analysis will be based on a comprehensive Strategic Resources & Consequences Report released by the company and reviewed by independent auditors, providing the following information in addition to that in our mock-up Sirius report: a detailed statement of company strategy to increase subscribers, preferably with expected milestones; an articulation of the efforts to develop new products and content; steps taken to maintain Sirius’s long-term competitive edge (wi-fi in the car strategy); costs breakdowns between investments and expenses to enable a more precise computation of the value created and life-time customer value; and other information relevant to the competitive position of Sirius. Absent all this, and based on the limited information we have, here is our summary analysis for investors:

>Sirius XM is a well-run operation. Moderate subscriber growth in the second quarter, 2013 (700,000 net new subscribers), mainly due to an overall increase in new car sales, coupled with tight cost controls produced a reasonable (about 5 percent of market value, annualized) value created, coupled with a substantial growth in the life-time (franchise) value of customers. Sirius’s dominant competitive position was maintained in the quarter and appears to be secure for the short-to-medium term. Regarding the long term, two concerns loom large: (1) relatively slow growth (new-car penetration is already high and seems to plateau, and the penetration of the used car market is slow), and (2) competitive threats from strong players in the Internet space (Apple, Google). It’s not clear at this stage to what extent Sirius management will be able to cope with these challenges. Accordingly, Sirius stock is a good fit for investors looking for safety and diversification, but questionable for investors looking for significant growth and capital gains.

## But is this really what investors need?

In Part II of the book, we elaborated on the main causes of accounting’s relevance lost: the absence in financial reports of relevant information on intangibles — the strategic resources of the enterprise, heavy reliance on managerial estimates and forecasts, and the failure to reflect important, non-transactional business events. Notably, these three stumbling blocks are absent from our Resources & Consequences Report. Rather than ignoring intangibles, the Report is built around the company’s strategic resources (mostly intangible), highlighting the major value drivers of the enterprise. Further- more, the Report abstracts from estimates or managerial subjective judgments: Number of new customers, churn rate, or patents and trademarks are all factual data easy for auditors to verify. Moreover, all important developments, whether recorded by the accounting system or not, like new contracts with car manufacturers, or products under development, are highlighted in the proposed Report. This is obviously a far cry from accounting-based financial information.

Importantly, rather than a short-term, backward-looking, and often biased record of the quarter or year that just ended (current financial information), the forward-looking Resources & Consequences Report enables a focus on the enterprise’s strategy and its execution and particularly facilitates a long-term assessment of the enterprise’s ability to maintain competitive advantage. A focus on the bottom line—investors’ preoccupation with earnings—is replaced by a panoramic view of the company’s strategy−execution−value creation.

The ultimate skeptic may still ask: How do we know that the information in the proposed Resources & Consequences Report really satisfies investors’ needs? In fact, we do know. Recently, one of us with two colleagues performed an extensive research on media and entertainment subscription-based companies—telecom, cable, Internet, software, print media, and so on, which, like Sirius XM, charge a subscription fee for their services.10 A major research question was this: What are the attributes of these enterprises that investors consider essential for security valuation, namely what information affects stock prices? A statistical (regression) analysis relating stock prices and returns of subscription-based enterprises to financial report variables (earnings and book value), as well as to certain key non-accounting data presented in the Resources & Consequences Report—like number of new subscribers, the churn rate, and revenue-per-subscriber—revealed that indeed, most of the latter, non-accounting indicators affected stock prices beyond earnings and equity. Investors clearly need and use the information in our proposed Report.
