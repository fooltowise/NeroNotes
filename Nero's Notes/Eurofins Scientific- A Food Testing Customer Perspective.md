### Bryan, can you please provide a short introduction to your background?

I worked in the food industry, for over 20 years, running quality assurance at major multi-billion-dollar companies in the CPG, beverage and dairy space, here in the US. I worked for companies such as Leprino Foods, Lactalis American Group and WhiteWave Foods.

### How would you describe how the food regulatory landscape has evolved, over the last 20 years?

The largest and most important change in the US market, relative to the food industry, was the passage of the Food Safety Modernization Act, under President Obama. That was over 10 years ago. The impetus for that was some major issues that happened in the United States, where people weren’t trusting their food anymore. The government acted uncharacteristically quickly, and passed this new regulation.

Within that, it really broadened the regulatory framework, relative to FDA. In the US, you have two main regulatory bodies for food; the Food and Drug Administration and the US Department of Agriculture. They divide products up, along different lines. Generally, USDA is dealing with meat products; beef, poultry, eggs and things of that nature. The FDA is dealing with the wide plethora of other types of products.

Prior to FSMA, FDA’s access to your records, as a manufacturer, was relatively limited. They had the ability to go in and look at records relative to interstate commerce. This depended on the business you operated in, such as seafood, juice or low-acid canned foods. They could also look at additional processing records but they couldn’t really look at much more. Under the law – believe it or not – prior to FSMA, if I was a dairy manufacturer and the FDA wanted to see my HACCP plan – my Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point food safety plan – they did not have a legal right to look at it.

With the passage of FSMA, that all changed. Under that umbrella, anything relative to food safety, the FDA can now manage and look at. That was a huge regulatory shift in the industry.

### Is that just around the processes when you are dealing with food or also where you source it from and how it’s transported? What is the level of detail that it goes into?

They set up the regulations and said, you need to have these types of programs in place. They specifically called out ones that they were concerned about. There were lots of issues around supplier control and foreign suppliers. Entities outside of the US, who are importing and bringing in finished products to this market, now had to meet strict requirements as well, even though they weren’t under the regulatory authority of the FDA. That caused a lot of ripples around the world. Imagine you are a Chinese company and you want to sell to the US. All of a sudden, you have to comply with US regulatory rules and, if they choose to, have FDA inspectors coming in and looking at your facility.

With that, there was also the requirement for having a food safety plan. The FDA used this opportunity to revise things and change their approach, with a food safety plan that replaced your HACCP plan, in most circumstances. The FDA was looking for specific things, relative to what are now breaking down into what are known as pre-requisite programs and preventive controls.

Pre-requisites are those items that you need to have at the base of your pyramid, that allow you to play the game correctly. For example, good manufacturing practices. If you are in a food facility, you have to train your people on how to manage food. They need to know how to wash their hands and all the rules that go with that, to make sure they are producing food safely. The preventive controls are analogous to the critical control points under HACCP. They were items that were really important and you needed to pay close attention to them. If you are managing allergens in your facility, you need to have very robust plans for that. If you are producing ready-to-eat foods, you need to have environmental monitoring programs in place, to make sure those products are doubly safe.

This all rolls into your food safety plan. Another big requirement was that you now needed to have a PCQI; a preventive controls qualified individual. They had to go to training and pass a course or they had to demonstrate to the FDA that they had the relevant experience to be managing food safety. That is a major shift. Essentially, the FDA said, whenever one of our investigators comes to your facility, we want to talk with someone who is responsible for food safety. One of the things that it is very important for food companies to remember is that the PCQI has a lot of responsibility on their shoulders.

### How did this change the demand for testing?

For example, if you were a ready-to-eat food company, making sandwiches, that means that there is no further processing. It’s not like a frozen pizza, where you are taking it home and baking it. You are buying a sandwich, in a convenience store, and you are consuming it without any other modifications. The FDA said, those products are higher risk because the consumer is completely relying upon you to maintain the food safety and they are trusting you to do that. Therefore, you need to have a robust environmental monitoring program, in your facilities, to make sure that listeria, salmonella and other pathogens aren’t making their way into those products. To your point, that increased the testing around that, significantly and testing for pathogens is not something that you want to be doing in your facility.

### Was it increased testing of the same types of tests or were there also different and new tests that were introduced?

I would just say more testing. The FDA were unique within regulations in that it was not prescriptive. They would say that it was up to you to figure out your risk characteristics and develop the appropriate plan. Of course, when they come to visit and audit you, they are going to decide if what you determined to be appropriate actually is.

Food companies then began to significantly increase their testing. In addition to that, the FDA devised their approach to companies into two tiers. There were routine inspections where they were going to go in and look at facilities; they called it a GMP audit, and it was making sure that you were doing the basics correctly. If they have cause where, for example, you as a consumer try and product and it makes you sick and you report this to the FDA, they may choose to go in and do an investigation, based upon that. That is called a Tier 2 and it is a much more serious situation. They will really be scrutinizing you closely.

This can then lead the FDA to what is called, colloquially, in the US, a swabathon. The FDA will come in and take, literally, hundreds of environmental samples in your facility, looking for these pathogens. Companies became aware of this and realized they really needed to up the testing that they were doing.

### Can we just walk through a typical testing process? Let’s say you were head of QA at WhiteWave or Lactalis; what is the first step in a typical test, if you are a dairy manufacturer?

A good way to think about this is that data in production facilities and within food companies always breaks into two categories. Firstly, there is operational data. These are the things that the plant and the plant manager need, to run the business. For example, labor, efficiency, downtime, parts replacements; all the things the company needs in order to remain profitable. The next bucket is quality data. These are things that, as consumers, we are worried about. For example, I have my lovely cup of coffee here this morning. As a consumer, I have expectations as to what this product should be like. I add creamer to my coffee and I buy light roast, so I don’t want it too bitter; it has to be the right temperature. You don’t want a lot of build up on the top of the coffee cup. Technically, it’s called blooming, when you have creamer that feathers at the top. These are things that a consumer, if unhappy with the product, may contact you and say, I bought a coffee, and this stuff is crap.

The third bucket is food safety. This is the most significant one but, unfortunately, it is often the one that is most overlooked because it is just assumed that these things are going to happen. But in reality, behind the scenes, lots of things are happening to maintain this.

Relative to testing, it breaks down into those buckets and, as I’ve mentioned, the food safety piece has increased significantly. In most cases, you need to outsource that. Quality data, internally, also went up because now you were looking at different profiles for the product and trying to figure out these different things. As companies are looking for ways to improve efficiency and those operational buckets, production runs may run longer. In quality, I would always be looking at those three different buckets of information and saying, do I have the right level of testing and data, at the right points in the process, to identify issues as soon as they arise, so I can nip them in the bud.

### Choosing a dairy product of your fancy, would you have specific tests that you would have to conduct, by regulation – either insourced or outsourced – for things such as salmonella or listeria?

From a regulatory standpoint, the FDA has two main tools when it comes to the law; adulteration and misbranding. Adulteration means that a product is produced – and these terms go back to the 1930s when these regulations were first written, in the US – and has been rendered unfit for consumption. For example, listeria is present in the product. It has been adulterated or damaged in some way to, essentially, move it to non-food; the FDA now considers it to be non-food.

Below that, is misbranding. For example, you have ingredients that are not listed on the label; allergens can, potentially, be a misbranding issue. If you have an undeclared allergen in your product and it’s not on the label, that would be a misbranding.

Often, when people read warning letters or Form 483s, which is the form that the FDA fills out when they find citations in your facility, you will see references to those. The FDA is citing their statutory and regulatory authority, to put it in one of those two buckets, to determine what the next course of action is.

### Let’s say that we have a product that you are manufacturing, what would be a typical biology or chemistry test that you would run?

Let’s stick with the dairy industry and let’s say I am a quality manager in a dairy plant. Production facilities always break down into four main functions. There is the receiving process where you are bringing ingredients into the facility. Then processing, where you are taking those ingredients and doing something to them. After that, you are packaging it up, taking it to the warehouse and shipping it out.

At each of those different steps in that hypothetical dairy plant, you have different tests that you need to perform and they fall into those different buckets that we talked about earlier. As an example, in a dairy plant, I am receiving in a truck load of raw milk. You have a large tanker that shows up at the facility and I need to make sure that that is meeting our specifications. I’ve made agreements with suppliers on what I expect. What is the temperature of the milk at arrival? You want it as cold as possible. In the US, you are looking for 40°F or less. You want to measure the bacterial loads. You want to look at chemical attributes. For example, titratable acidity; what is the amount of free acids that are available in that milk, that may impact the manufacturing process?

You have this litany of tests that you are running through, at receiving, to make sure that it is meeting standards. Most of those tests are going to be quality control tests. You want to bring in raw materials that are going to make good product because, as you know, if you bring in bad materials, you are going to make bad product.

### What is the mix in insourcing and outsourcing for those tests?

When you are looking at testing, the criteria you are looking for is speed. If a truck of milk is sitting there, waiting for you to determine if you are going to accept it or not, the clock is ticking. That driver has other places to be; that carrier has other things to do. And so does the plant. They are waiting for that milk so that they can make cheese. You want to be able to run those tests as quickly as possible. You don’t have time, for example, to wait for microbiological testing. That is why you will use other things, such as pH testing, TA and visual evaluations, to give you a good idea of the quality of that milk, before you receive it.

In terms of microbiological testing, you may pull samples for a later evaluation to see, in hindsight, how it is. But if you are doing a standard plate count, that’s two days. If you are doing a yeast and mold test, that’s five days. You can’t wait that long.

### Is there any specific regulation around the microbiological testing?

No, not relative to actual quantities and things of that nature. But, for example, in the EU, there are requirements around geometric means for the base level of somatic cells, in raw milk. If I am a dairy manufacturer in the US, exporting into the EU, I have to report those numbers on the quality of the raw milk, to that regulatory body. You would probably do that on a quarterly basis to determine those numbers. But there is no set value that states you have to do this test, this many times.

Here in the US, when FSMA was set up, there was a lot of discussion between industry and the FDA on what these regulations should look like. In the US, a law is passed by Congress. Congress will say, okay, this is the Food Safety Modernization Act; we need the FDA to do these things. But it doesn’t tell the FDA how to do those things. It is just the law, directing them that they have the authority to do this. The FDA then writes regulations to meet the requirements of the law. That regulatory writing process can take quite a long time and there are also requirements on public review and things of that nature.

This is when industry, trade groups and FDA will get together and discuss these types of topics. I was involved, through a trade group, with the FDA, on setting up the regulations around foreign supplier verification, under the law. Part of this conversation was working with the FDA and giving them an understanding that these things are all based upon the context of what you are doing. For example, if you are a manufacturer of non-fat dry milk, which is a powdered milk, it can be used in a myriad of applications. The actual testing requirements for a customer are going to vary.

You have a 50lb bag of non-fat dry milk. If I’m selling it to a company that’s making dog food, their requirements are going to be very different from if I’m selling that same bag of dry milk to a company that is producing infant formula; there will be very different food safety standards. Often, it will be customers that will drive those requirements.

### With the regulatory changes we’ve see, how do you see the number of microbiological tests changing over the next decade?

I think testing will only increase. Part of that is that we are gaining ever greater insights into what is going on in our products, in our processes, in our facilities and in our finished products. A big chunk of this is due to improvements in testing. For example, for chemistry testing, we used to talk in terms of parts per million. Now we talk in terms of parts per billion because the tests are becoming more and more sensitive. We’re able to see things in products that we didn’t see before. As a result of that, we see problems that we didn’t even know were there.

If you have a very low level of benzine and you do a test and it’s been negative forever; you never find benzine in your product. It’s zero parts per million. All of a sudden, you are now doing a more sensitive test and you are getting 10 parts per billion. It was probably there before but you just couldn’t see it. Is it a risk? Now you need to do more testing to figure that out.

### Are these types of microbiological tests ever done internally or are they always outsourced to the likes of Eurofins?

Generally, for your quality control tests, you want to run them in-house. That milk truck is waiting so you want to get that testing done as quickly as possible and so it has to be done in-house. In terms of food safety, a lot of it depends on the size of the company. If I am a small food manufacturer, with one facility, with 50 employees, I don’t have the resources to do that testing in-house and I am going to be sending out a lot more things. As I grow, I’m probably going to be building my own corporate laboratory and doing the testing at my own facility. As you can imagine, that is a huge commitment to resources. If I’m a smaller company, I’m much more reliant on these external sources.

Let’s say you are running a pathogen test and you are looking for salmonella in your finished, ready-to-eat product. These tests require controls; positive and negative controls. That means you may, in most cases, need to have a positive control; an actual live listeria sample that you can run through the machine, to make sure that it’s working correctly. That is a big problem. What happens if that gets out of the lab and makes its way into the plant? You could be creating your own problem. Often, plants will say, no, I’m not going to mess with that; I’m going to use an external lab.

### Again, taking an example of a dairy product and you are testing for listeria, is there always one type of test per unit? Or do you also have multiple tests – one biology, one chemistry – per unit?

In your finished product, you are going to have specifications for release of that product. Within that, you are going to have the criteria that you want to make sure are being met for that product. Again, that’s going to fall under food safety, food quality and operational parameters. If I am working in quality assurance in a plant and I’m looking to release products, I’m going to be looking at the quality control measures. Are the packages sealed correctly? Do they weight the right amount? Those are the things that don’t cause any risk to health.

I’m also going to be looking at those food safety measures which may include finished product testing. It may also include other parameters in the environment that I need to review before I release product. For example, a very common control in the US, for physical contaminates, is metal detection or x-ray technology, looking for things in your product that shouldn’t be there.

As the preventive control qualified individual in the facility, I would need to review that information before the product was released, to make sure everything went okay. Was that metal detector working properly? Did the operator fill out all the information correctly? Did they run the control wands? Was the operating mechanism, that knocks the product off the line, into a special container, working properly? I then sign on the dotted line to say, yes, all these things are okay and this product is now acceptable for release.

Relative to your question on testing, a big chunk of this is lot size; how big is my lot? For example, if you are looking at a production run, during a day, of 50,000 units that you have manufactured and you only pull a 25g sample, for evaluation of microbiological issues, it’s not going to tell you a whole lot. That is, statistically, a very small sample. You may have a problem and not even know about it.

A good way to think about quality testing in these realms is chemistry testing versus micro-testing. Chemistry testing tends to be rather homogenous, which means that, if you have that hypothetical cheese product that we are working on – let’s say we’re making Brie – if you are testing pH in that production run, for that day, it’s going to be pretty close to the same, all the way through, as it will be distributed through the product evenly. Micro doesn’t work that way; micro tends to be clumpy. If you have contamination in your production equipment, at the beginning of the day, your micro counts are going to be much higher at the start of the day. As the system cleans itself out, counts are going to go down. If you only sample at the end of the run, you’re not going to see that.

Part of that is setting up intelligent sampling programs to make sure that you’re catching those little spot issues that you may have with that micro. Statistically, looking for microbiological problems is harder than finding ones with chemistry.

### Say you’re working as head of QA at a dairy company, running a dairy plant; how do you choose the lab testing supplier, such as Eurofins, Bureau Veritas or SGS? What are the key decision-making criteria that you would use to choose a provider?

This goes back to one of my earlier comments which was about speed. If I have a production facility in Wisconsin and I choose a laboratory that is on the other side of the continent, that is going to slow up my testing results. The samples have to get there and transit. Ideally, I want to find a lab that is relatively close to my facility. If it’s close enough, in most cases, those laboratories have couriers. Assuming I have enough business with them, they will come to my facility and pick those samples up. I can get those test result turnarounds much quicker.

The other thing is reputation. I need to understand this laboratory. For Eurofins, Mérieux, Food Safety Net or others, what is their reputation? Do they have a good reputation for testing and providing reliable, repeatable data? Under FSMA, one of the requirements that is now rolling into effect was that you need to use laboratories that are ISO 17025 certified. They have to be audited, as well. ISO people will come to the labs and make sure they are doing the tests correctly, that they have the right controls in place and that people are trained.

The other criterion that I would look at is cost per test and negotiating those costs.

### What is more important? Cost or turnaround time?

Turnaround time. If I have that hypothetical 50,000 cases of products sitting in the warehouse, that I can’t ship, I’m losing money.

### How quick are we talking? What is the turnaround time you would expect?

This is the Holy Grail of micro-testing. Organisms grow at their own pace and they don’t care that I want to release product. Part of the what the industry and companies have been doing, to develop tests, is trying to figure out different ways to speed up testing. Some are more successful than others and I think they are starting to make breakthroughs in certain areas. For example, one of the more stubborn tests, that takes the longest, is yeast and mold testing. Traditionally, this has been done on a petri dish and that test takes five days once the test actually starts; you have to wait five days and see if it grows. They have been trying to figure out ways to speed that up and keep it reliable and there has only been some success.

As somebody on the quality side, who is shopping around and trying to find the right tests, that becomes critical. You may have a yeast and mold test that is a little faster but you may be missing slow growing organisms.

### If you’re finding a supplier, would you then check where the labs are, geographically, to see how fast they could be?

As vice president of quality at a number of companies, one of the things that I was responsible for was setting these up for the plants. I didn’t want the plants picking these on their own. This is something that we needed to be consistent across the country. For example, you earlier mentioned WhiteWave foods, which is now part of Danone. When I was there, I had two divisions, 18 production facilities, partnerships with 40 co-packers, who were helping us make products. If every plant within that network had the ability to choose their own labs or tests, it would be chaos.

I need reliable data that is consistent and using the same information. I want all the laboratories doing the same test and, ideally, the same laboratory company doing that testing. That also gives me leverage because now I can negotiate a national contract and, hopefully, get that cost per test down.

### Looking at Eurofins specifically, one thing that I found pretty interesting was that they seem to run a hub and spoke network with their labs. They have split up their testing so they have one lab that does biology, one that does chemistry, one that does toxins. As a customer, how would you look at that?

I may be biased, but I think that was a very smart move by Eurofins. They have set up what they call centers of excellence. For example, they have a laboratory in Iowa, that focuses on, and works closely with, petfood companies, so they understand that industry very well. They are able to quickly recommend tests, work with them if they have problems and partner with them very closely.

It’s pretty much dropped off now but there was a period of time, in the US, where there were quite a few recalls associated with petfood. This was due to high levels of Vitamin D which, in pets, is toxic. Eurofins laboratory was the one that first detected and identified that defect.

### When you look at turnaround time, for example, if you’ve got a product that needs one biology test and one chemistry test, if you have to send it to two labs, surely that increases the turnaround time for Eurofins?

That can sometimes be a very difficult dynamic to balance. Generally, my goal with the chemistry side of testing was to do as much of that in-house as possible, because of the consistency of the testing and my ability to have a tight rein on that. Additionally, as we mentioned before, not having to have pathogens for controls. Companies often look outsourcing the pathogen side, the microbiological side of testing, much more closely.

### Would you say customers are insourcing a lot of the chemistry?

This goes back to the size of the company and how much resource you have. For my plants, they did most of the chemistry testing themselves. If I had a special situation where there was an element I wanted to look at, with some special t-testing around HPLC, for example, where I didn’t necessarily have that $200,000 piece of equipment handy, I would do a one-off and send that out for a study. But I wouldn’t do it as a consistent thing.

### But you would always outsource biology because that is the pathogen side?

The basic quality control microbiological testing we would do in-house. That is issues such as standard plate counts, coliform testing and ATP testing. Once you cross that line and you go into the food safety side and you are looking at salmonella and listeria, then you’re most likely going to be sending those out.

### How do you choose a provider for biology testing, specifically? Turnaround time?

Yes, exactly. Another big piece of this is support and some companies are better at this than others. For example, at Eurofins, they give you access to some amazing expertise in their company, who are there just to do that. A friend of mine, Dr Doug Marshall, at Eurofins, is their main microbiology guy. He can help you with issues. Instead of me, blindly flailing around on a particular issue, he can assist with that. Providing that expertise is a huge value-add that I would look for in these companies.

From a laboratory standpoint, it helps move you out of commoditization. If every conversation I have with a potential customer is, all I care about is cost per test and turnaround time, if you can beat this, I’ll give you my business, that’s not a good model.

### You want the supplier to also help you detect and solve new problems?

Exactly. Let’s use the example of that laboratory in Iowa. Let’s say I am a petfood manufacturer and I start talking with them, with the potential of using them as my laboratory. They say, yes, we can absolutely do these tests, but we also have this expertise and we deal with petfood day in and day out. We know the problems; we know the pitfalls. If you’re having an issue, we probably know the solution. That’s a huge help.

### Who did you use, as a supplier, during your times at WhiteWave?

It would vary. Mérieux always did a good job. I did use Eurofins; I had a really good experience with Eurofins. I was working for a sugar refinery company, running their quality, and we were building a new location for receiving sugar in California. Eurofins just happened to be building a new laboratory, not too far away. I was put in contact with the future lab manager who, even though her laboratory wasn’t yet built, went to my facility, pulled samples, arranged to have those sent to an existing laboratory and followed up on that information. That is some really good customer service, I was very impressed and they got my business.

### In your experience, how would you compare the turnaround times at Eurofins versus competitors?

It depends on the locality and things of that nature. And things happen. I’ve been working with Eurofins with a client of mine right now and we started setting up some additional monitoring in the environmental sampling and we started working with their laboratories, and we had some hiccups. When you are setting up a new account, that happens.

### What were the hiccups?

We were getting results back slowly; they weren’t starting the tests as soon as we’d thought. Within laboratories, they have different codes for different tests and methodologies that need to be done in different samples. Some of those were missed. But we stuck with them because they were willing to say, yes, we made some mistakes; we’re going to fix them and it’s going to get better.

It all comes down to those things in life that we all appreciate, which is good customer service. Having companies that are willing to step up and say, yes, we made a mistake and here’s what we’ve done in trying to fix that, and we shouldn’t be seeing that again, that goes a long way to building confidence. Nobody is perfect. As long as they are willing to do that, I’m willing to give them a chance.

### You said it was a great idea that Eurofins split up the network, in terms of microbiology, chemistry and pesticides all doing separate types of testing. How does that structure compare to competitors? Do they do something similar or is it very different? For example, do they do biology and chemistry in one lab?

I know some labs – FS Net in Texas, for example – will focus in on specific industries. They are very well known within the meat industry. If you are a beef producer, you are very familiar with them and they know your business. They have focused their business model in a particular industry which is, essentially, very similar to what Eurofins did with their centers of excellence. That is probably the best example I can think of.

### I’m just thinking, from Eurofins’ point of view, is the biology testing really the point of contact with the customer, given that it’s more regular and, typically, more outsourced, would you say they tend to enter a customer with biology and then let the customer know they have all these centers of excellence for chemistry or pesticides, so that if they need a more specialized test, you can always use those services?

Yes, I think so. Over time, odd things pop up and you need to have resources to be able to contact and talk that through. You would call up Eurofins and say, I’m having some weird results; can you help me investigate this? A big part in quality – and this is true in anybody’s role – is that you may not have all the answers but you at least need to know who to talk to, to try to figure it out.

For example, with Eurofins, they have a big genetics testing laboratory in Louisiana. All the expertise is there which benefits them, as well, because now you are able to talk shop with your team and individuals who have the same passion, interest and expertise that you do. Instead of having those guys all over the country, they are able to interact and work with each other much more closely and get that information that you may need, around PCR testing and things of that nature.

### How important do you think that really is from a US customer’s point of view, when you are choosing an outsourced lab provider? Eurofins do claim that one of their real advantages is being, effectively, a one-stop shop for testing. Would you actually choose a different provider if you already used Eurofins?

I would probably have to have a good reason. Let’s say I contacted them and they said, we don’t really specialize in that, I would have to find somebody else. In general, you are not asking these questions ad hoc; you are asking them for a specific reason, such as a customer having a requirement or the FDA has visited your facility and found issues and you are in negotiations and discussions with the FDA. You’ve identified unknown parameters in your facility and you are trying to troubleshoot.

### When you look at the quality of the tests, how do you analyze that? Surely, a biology test is more commoditized these days, between the providers?

It’s like it goes up in a tier now. You have your base commodity type testing, such as standard plate, coliform, yeast and molds. That is going to be very much cost based. But the more technical the test becomes, the more important that expertise is, because the cost goes up significantly. If you are doing environmental monitoring and you are sending it to an outside lab, you have all kinds of different options as to how you would like that analyzed and how far you want to take that data.

For example, if you are looking for listeria in your environment, for your environmental monitoring program, do you want to know just that species or do you want to take it out? Do you want to know if it’s mono, welshimiri, or are there some other types of markers associated with that? With that, the cost goes up significantly. Figuring out the right level of information is extremely important. In the US, one of the things that the FDA does, when they go in and do these swabathons, is that they will completely type out whatever they find in your facility.

Let’s say they go to my plant and they find listeria. They’re going to take it all the way out and identify the genetic fingerprint of that particular strain of listeria. They then take that information and match it up against their database, which now has over a million individual samples, to see if it matches any other outbreaks or cold cases. The FDA will go back and see if they can match previously unidentified outbreaks with that particular strain in your plant. You need to be aware of that, as a manufacturer, and say, if that’s the case, do I also want to take it to that level, so I have data to compare? Right now, I think that is something the industry is wrestling with and figuring out how to manage.

### How could you switch from Eurofins if you were using them?

It depends on the size of your company. If I have plants all over the US and I have a contract and I want to switch, that’s a major undertaking. If I’m a regional player and I have one plant, with one lab, and I have other options, it’s relatively easy to do. Part of the evaluation you make, when managing these programs, is whether the pain is worth it. Let’s say Eurofins is really having an issue; I’m not getting my test results; I’m getting results that are questionable and I’m unable to work through it. Once it reaches that pain threshold, then I’m going to make that decision.

### When you were at WhiteWave, would you have an annual volume target with Eurofins, per microbiology and chemistry?

Yes. I would have a corporate testing budget and then the plants would have their internal and, possibly external, testing budgets that would roll under that. I would take that to those laboratory companies and bid it out. I would say, I can guarantee you a minimum of 1,000 environmental tests, over the course of the year, which helps them determine their resource allocation and how aggressive they can be on their bidding.

Part of the thing with microbiology versus chemistry is that organisms don’t quit growing on the weekend, so you need to have laboratory staff who are coming in on weekends and holidays, to make sure these things are running smoothly so that can really impact your labor. Additionally, if you are working in the laboratory, do you really want to come into work on Christmas Day? It can be hard to find people to do that.

### If you’ve got a budget for a plant, would you split that budget out by test type?

It would be in the biology and chemistry buckets and then the internal and external testing. What testing am I going to do in-house? What is my production predicted to be for this year? Therefore, how many tests do I need to run? How many technicians do I need in the lab? Externally, for environmental monitoring, pathogen testing, special projects – let’s say that we wanted to extend shelf life on our product – sometimes you can do that in-house, but often you just don’t have the bandwidth, so you may do a special project, with an outside laboratory, to set up a shelf life extension program. If you have a crisis in your facility, this can radically alter things.

Let’s say, for example, I’m working in a cheese plant and I have a recall. I didn’t know I had a problem; now I know I have a huge problem. The product has been recalled and the FDA is crawling all over my plant; I am going to significantly increase my testing, to get this back under control. All those things need to be taken into consideration. If you’re working with a smaller, regional laboratory who may not be able to handle that volume, that’s really going to put a strain on your plans.

### For the outsourced testing – for you as a customer of Eurofins – how has the pricing for microbiology tests changed, over the last five years?

The commodity tests have been relatively static. When you get into more of the specialized tests – because you are now getting into more cutting-edge technologies – you can be all over the board, depending on what you want and how large a sample you need.

### It seems to be quite custom. It’s almost as if each customer is a special project, to a certain extent, for the more specialized tests?

Absolutely. There have been incredible advances in genetic identification, PCR testing. We’ve all seen in the news what’s going on with CRISPR and gene editing. That area is growing really quickly. When you are on the cutting edge of technology, in these type of applications, you have a much larger cushion, relative to profitability; it’s like the new iPhone versus the iPhone 6.

### The more commoditized testing was stable over time?

There’s a standard floor you really can’t go below. You know your costs; you know your labor and inputs.

### What about chemistry?

Chemistry is very similar to that. Chemistry is also pretty commoditized. Your basic testing around salt, color or pH, or chemical analysis using HPLC, are all pretty stable. I wouldn’t expect significant price fluctuations on that side. There is not a whole lot of specialty chemistry testing that pops up. Again, it goes back to how we started our conversation; how sensitive do you need to be? Do you need results in parts per million or parts per billion? That is going to determine pricing.

### As you said, you can do part of the chemistry stuff internally. What about the pesticides and toxins? Is that typically a large part for a dairy plant or a food manufacturer?

No. A lot of those types of things you want to push off onto your suppliers. Under the Food Safety Modernization Act, you have to have supplier controls in place and you have to identify hazards associated with those materials and who is controlling them. Using the pesticides example, let’s talk about Alar in apples; this used to be a big problem in the US. If I was wanting to buy apples, to make apple sauce, in my food safety plan, I would identify that a potential risk, with apples, is that this chemical contaminate is present. I would go back to my suppliers and say, here’s my specification; we require that all the apples that you sell us test negative for that contaminate. We would build that into the contract for the supplier.

Under my procedures for supplier evaluation, it will depend on whether or not I know these guys. Let’s say this is a large, national company that I’ve been working with for 20 years and I trust them. I would say, we will accept your COA, certificate of analysis, based upon these lots and the seasonality. If this is a new company that I don’t know, I may do my own internal testing as well, to make sure that they are doing what they say they are doing.

### Going back to microbiology, in your experience, how were Eurofins priced, versus competitors?

That is something that laboratory testing companies are constantly monitoring, to make sure they are staying in line with their competitors. There was never anything that was out of line with the competition.

### Because of their scale in food, would they be able to underprice on the biology and capture all the chemistry and the other more specialized tests, when they own the biology testing for the customers?

Within that Eurofins model what you can do – and a business unit manager may make a decision to do this – is you could use your commodity type testing as a loss leader, in order to get higher profit type products.

### Did you ever see that, where Eurofins were really competitive on biology pricing because they knew they could capture your future chemistry and pesticide tests?

Yes, absolutely. The smart labs do that.

### I believe Eurofins gave decision making to the actual lab manager, so it could be different by locality?

Eurofins has a very unique model in that they are pretty decentralized. That is both a strength and a weakness. If you are a business unit manager, you have your own P&L and you are managing your own budget.

### Is a lab manager a business unit manager? Or could it be multiple labs?

You are the business unit manager so you are running the lab. You have a budget, you are responsible for it and then you report up to the CEO on the progress that you are making in your laboratory. For example, when I was at Eurofins, I ran two divisions within that company. I ran the auditing and training and then the certification and auditing groups. Each of those different divisions, which we kept separate, because you don’t want auditors doing consulting work; from an ethics standpoint, that is not a good thing. I had my own budgets; I had my own personnel and I had some support functions that would work through corporate, such as access to accounting and IT. But it was mine.

### What are the disadvantages to the Eurofins decentralized model?

They are very flat, which means they don’t have a lot of internal support. If you are working in accounting, at Eurofins, you don’t have one P&L budget for North America; you have multiples on all the different business units. The complexity, internally, is logarithmic, because they have a whole lot of different things to manage. They same thing applies to other support functions, such as IT and admin. Between myself and the CEO of Eurofins, there were only two layers; there was my boss and his boss.

### Who have, effectively, got over 900 businesses, which is each lab?

It’s also an advantage from that standpoint in that, as we have seen with Eurofins, they have grown very rapidly through acquisition. They are able to purchase a lab in Paraguay and incorporate that into the Eurofins model by saying, essentially, this is now a business unit and you are now part of our network.

### What do you think are the biggest challenges for Eurofins to grow in food?

It’s really about reacting to these new challenges and changes that we were talking about. Around the world, Covid radically altered how things are being done in food companies and it radically altered how regulatory agencies were managing those. Essentially, in a lot of instances, the FDA quit going to facilities because they weren’t able to. Within the US, we saw a drop in recalls over the past two years and people are still going over that to try and figure out why. Do I predict those numbers going up in 2022? Probably, yes.

If there is less testing, then that becomes a challenge to Eurofins too. How do you react to those type of things and make sure that you are keeping your volumes and you are meeting your budget numbers? For the support companies, like Eurofins or Mérieux, the ones that react the best to changes in the industry and provide the most support are the ones that are going to come out of these type of situations ahead.

### Do you think there’s a potential problem of a structural decline in testing, due to less physical visits?

I think it’s temporary. I think we’re coming out of this. Covid is running its course, like most pathogens do. Over time, less virulent versions have come out, with a higher infection rate, and we’re seeing that now, with Omicron and I think we’re on the tail end of it; we’re coming out of it. Things are going to be getting back to normal, whatever that may be, but food companies have definitely been impacted by it. People still had to eat and food companies still had to run, which meant the laboratories still had to run. These companies had to put in new protocols and figure these things out on the fly.

There were lots of times during this situation where I would reach out to industry contacts and friends of mine, to see how things were going. The messaging back would be, great to hear from you but I can’t talk. They were trying to figure things out on the fly in terms of how to protect the products. Remember, early on, there was talk as to whether this virus was transmissible through food and people were getting very worried about that. Then it turned out that that doesn’t appear to be the case but, as you can recall, at the beginning, we were all bringing things into our house and wiping them down with bleach, being extra cautious.

The same thing applied in the food industry; they didn’t know. Here in Colorado, in the US, where I live, there is a meat company who had several employees who died from Covid, because of the close proximity that the employees worked with each other. There was an infection that went through and caused a lot of illness in that facility. Food companies were highly aware of that and I think it dramatically altered how they were doing things.

### You think this potential decline in food testing is temporary because of Covid and the FDA not visiting plants?

Exactly. As the FDA ramps up, they will then be circling back and looking at those higher risk items first. In terms of that Tier 2 auditing that we discussed earlier, where are we seeing complaints for illnesses? Where are we seeing trends for listeria? What type of products are we worried about? The different FDA districts around the US are going to be hitting that full scale. As I tell my clients, in my consulting business, if they haven’t come, they’re coming, so you need to be ready. I think this remote process is, very rapidly, coming to an end.

### What do you think is the biggest disadvantage to Eurofins, specifically in food in the US market, versus competitors?

They’re all really playing on the same field. I would say, again, it’s about that regional specialty, like FS Net down in Texas and things of that nature, who have established a niche. It becomes very hard to dislodge and build your business in those areas.

### Per specific industry, category or product line, effectively?

Exactly. Quality people talk to each other; we go to conferences and talk shop. If I’m in the meat industry and I’m looking around for a new lab, I may talk to a quality manager from another company and ask who they use. They may say, we use these guys; they are amazing and they understand our industry inside out. That is going to have an influence.

### Can you see any risk of smaller players, similar to FS Net in Texas, entering the food business and having, effectively, microbiology labs closer to customers, if turnaround time matters most?

Potentially. In the US, the food industry tends to cluster. For example, you have lots of food manufacturers in California, Wisconsin and New York. You don’t have a lot of businesses in the dairy industry in the south east because it’s too hot for dairy cows, so you are far away from your milk; your plants tend to cluster around where the milk is. There are already labs there so they are already set up in those markets. If I was a new company trying to come and set up there, it would be exceptionally challenging.

The food industry is just like anything else; you have your big players, your medium guys and then the mom-and-pops. If you’re trying to cater to the mom-and-pops, that’s going to be extremely difficult because they’re not going to have very many samples and they’re not going to have a lot of testing. How do you make that work? You have to have a lot of them. I don’t know that anybody has really cracked that model. It’s a lot easier to build a laboratory close to a large, 1,000 employee dairy plant, but everybody knows about that dairy plant.

### These bigger companies, effectively, have the first mover advantage. When you chose Mérieux – I think you mentioned you used them before – what was the reasoning behind that?

That goes back a long time; I don’t even think, at that point in time, that Eurofins was a player in the US. They were Silliker Labs, before they were acquired by Mérieux. They had a very strong reputation in the US of servicing the dairy industry. Silliker was very well-known for working with and supporting the dairy industry; they were based in Chicago.

### You got this from friends?

Yes, and as well, often when you come into a company, things are already there. You don’t necessarily set things up again. A lot of times, ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’ applies.

### The reason I’m asking is because one of the key things that Eurofins always says is that there are very high switching costs in the industry. When you have a customer, you’ve pretty much got them for a very long time. In your experience, is that true. If not, when would it not really be true? When would you see customers switch?

I’ll use the example of auditing. You contract with certification bodies to come out and do third party audits for your facility, to make sure you are doing things well, to satisfy your customers. Retention rates are very high and that’s the case with Eurofins and other certification companies, as well; Mérieux also does auditing. That pain threshold has to be very high. They really have to be messing up because changing is such a pain. That’s true for testing, as well.

In most cases, you did it strategically, to have that national contract. The laboratories were close by; they had good customer service and expertise. If everything blows up, changing is not easy.

### Are they linked to your ERP system? Where do you receive the data? For example, how do you receive the test results?

That can also depend upon the size of the company. For example, at WhiteWave, we had a very sophisticated laboratory that we built and they have a LIMS system which, in a lot of cases, was directly integrated into the databases for the laboratories. As soon as they completed the testing and put that information in their systems, we saw it.

### Which, again, makes it harder to switch?

Exactly. If you’re a mom-and-pop, you’re probably having to wait to get the email notification with the certificate for the testing. Depending on how quickly you need it, you’re on the phone asking if the test has been done, so that you can release your product.
