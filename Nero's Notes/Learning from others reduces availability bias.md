People tend to overweight direct experiences and underweight vicarious ones.

> You don't have to pee on an electric fence to learn not to do it.
 -- Charlie Munger
 
 Example: Lehman Brother's collapse:
 
 “We have never seen anything like this,” said analyst Glenn Schorr, who covers the investment banks for UBS AG. “There have been tough situations like Long-Term Capital Management and the crash of 1987, but the problem here is there is leverage in the securities under the microscope and in the banks that own them. And to try and unwind it all at once creates a one-way market where there are only sellers, and no buyers.” - WSJ, September 14, 2008

**But financial history is littered with examples after examples of similar situations...**

**Just because YOU haven’t seen anything like this, does NOT mean its never happened before.**
