### When I look into this space, I guess the first place to start is, how to map out the competitive landscape; who really competes with who? Could you describe how you see Wix positioned in a world of Squarespace, Shopify, GoDaddy and so on?

Analyst 1: When we got into the position, I think the pieces were that there was a big TAM and a long runway. There is going to be this market share that has been taken, over time, from WordPress and Wix has a culture of always evolving through R&D, and recycling capital back into R&D and improving the product. That will allow it to continue to take market share because we have the shift to online as well as the market share that they take from WordPress. Those were the top-level pieces.

In comparison to others, we felt that Squarespace was a little more niche, on the design space. At that point in time, Wix was definitely the leader in the do-it-yourself category, which is about 10% of the market, with 90% being the agency side. I think the big question now is, it seems as if they also want to push into the agency side of things as the 10% of the DIY is somewhat saturated. Can they keep taking market share there?

### Just on that point, what exactly about Wix – given the advantages they have in driving new users and converting those users, in the DIY space, to subscribers – gives them the advantage to actually crack the B2B or agency space?

Analyst 1: I would start off by saying I don’t have a high conviction, at the moment, in the sense that I can’t say I know the answer to that, confidently. That is the starting point and it’s a work in progress. Initially, when we saw the metrics on return on marketing spend and net retention, given that we have our own website on Wix and it’s so cheap, there is a lot of upside in the sense of ARPU, of being able to raise prices. All those factors gave us a sense of confidence that there is a long runway. Even if customer account growth is somewhat slower than the 20% rate, there are levers to pull on the ARPU side. Maybe someone else is better qualified to answer on the other aspect.

### Do you have any thoughts, specifically, on how you look at Wix’s positioning to crack the agency side?

Analyst 2: First of all, the customer proximity is a big advantage, in terms of how close they are to their customers and how constant dialogue with and feedback from their customers drives their product evolution and has done so, right from the beginning. That coupled with their very impressive engineering organization and their huge willingness to invest in R&D, significantly above and beyond others in the space, gives me confidence that they will just be able to constantly iterate, improve the product and serve customers better, as they move up into more of the partner segment.

There is one thing and I’m curious as to whether anybody else has some thoughts on this. When I started studying this space, I was thinking that there has to a winner. Who is going to be the winner? But the more I think about it and learn about it, the more I think that, depending on who the user is, or the type of customer, there are lots of little sub-segments of this market. It is not as if there are five relevant competitors for every user. If you are doing heavier ecommerce, Shopify is obviously an amazing business. If you are just DIY, some of the heavier and more code-oriented solutions are not really relevant. I’ve sort of come away thinking that this is less of a market where there are five or six really strong competitors, going after every user.

### Wix don’t seem to share the merchants on the partner side and what type of business they are. Obviously, there are lots of restaurants and stuff like that. I see it as Wix doing more of the service-based offerings and then Shopify does ecommerce or product-based.

Analyst 2: There are also factors such as if your business is not predominantly ecommerce. If your coffee shop also sells mugs, hats and t-shirts, you have a small ecommerce business, Shopify is not really the best solution for you. It is quite a bit more expensive, if your primary business is something other than ecommerce and you do a little bit of ecommerce on the side. That’s a good example of what I’m talking about where, on Shopify, the website building functionality isn’t really the same. Unless you are doing big ecommerce, it’s not necessarily as relevant a competitor.

### Does anybody else want to share their views on how they look at Wix attacking the agency partner side?

Analyst 3: I think Webflow is the big problem for them. Wix have invested heavily in trying to get better position for the agency side of things, with low code no code, and do it in a way where the owner of the site still owns the actual code, so they could do something and import it a little easier. That is something that Squarespace doesn’t do, where they cater more to design agencies. Webflow does everything, makes it easy for everyone and seems to have dominant share of the non-WordPress agency-built sites.

Wix doesn’t have a lot of trust in the agency community, at this point. What I really like about Wix is that their approach to DIY is really smart and in contrast to Squarespace. I love the fact that you have the freemium model where you have these cohorts of people who build their site for free and you have a never-ending funnel. This is in contrast to Squarespace who makes people pay from day one and just might not get the person who, luckily, ends up with a site that turns into something more or who wants to pay down the line.

The key is, they’re annuity-like businesses. People don’t move their site once they are there, so you really want to lock them in and get them there. I do think there is something to be said about how the entire WordPress world is, basically, up for grabs. That is a massive TAM and that is what keeps me interested here.

I guess one of the other things that I worry about is that, perhaps, the website itself is losing some degree of significance, even if someone still needs web presence, at the end of the day.

Analyst 2: Do you have a sense for what Webflow’s run rate revenue is right now?

Analyst 3: I don’t.

Analyst 2: I’ve seen some statistics out there, but it’s hard to know what is reliable and what isn’t. Wix recently disclosed what they are calling their partners’ revenue. I’m not sure that Webflow is so much bigger in that partner space. I haven’t seen any data, either way, that I would place a huge amount of weight on.

Analyst 1: If you have a view that Webflow is taking market share, how do you come to that view?

Analyst 3: Talking with a handful of people at agencies, who do this for their job, where they are heading and what they are thinking and seeing from their peers.

Analyst 1: We’ve not done an extended expert review but I’ve read a bunch of different transcripts and they always get a mixed outcome. Some will say they are great and they use Wix and some will say, no, it’s got a bad reputation. It’s mixed; that has been my experience so far.

Analyst 3: Quite similar on Wix but I definitely hear a lot of enthusiasm about Webflow. They are pretty new, relative to Wix and Squarespace.

Analyst 4: For me, for Wix, if you acquire the users, you need to have the hypothesis that this is like acquiring real estate. You own the customers’ websites because you own the code and they cannot move. The big question for me is, can they upsell existing customers that have grown with them, into more professional businesses? What you see from the cohort data, it seems to suggest that this is rather hard, in my view. If you look at today’s world, if you are an influencer, for example, you don’t even need a home page. Most influencers only have their Instagram and TikTok profile. Having a home page is no longer an essential part of their work.

The mix changes and I think, what you see from Wix is that they are trying to adapt in this world, in terms of going towards apps and so on. I think there are a lot of moving parts and this is the main reason that has held me back, so far.

### The big question I have is, what are the type of agencies that work with Wix? What businesses are those agencies serving? If we assume that, in most pure ecommerce, businesses are going to start on Shopify because of the infrastructure and fulfilment. What other agencies are they going to attract and what gives them an advantage that means Shopify can’t come and enter that space, in the long run?

Analyst 3: There are a lot of vertical-specific agencies, such as someone who makes sites for restaurants, for general practitioners. Each has unique and quirky needs. That’s one of the areas I found suitable with Squarespace, where the more design-centric and the more important it was for beauty and aesthete to be part of that vertical’s appeal, the more those people tended to flock to that area.

The problem is, every feature that Squarespace pursued in beautiful aesthete could be copied, quite easily, by Wix and anyone else, shortly thereafter. These things are, effectively, commodities. There is no true innovation that is enduring, in that sense. Even if you culturally emphasize those needs above all others, any facet could be covered.

But I don’t think Shopify can really compete where embedded native commerce isn’t the endgame. The sites are not made for that kind of display. They are, not necessarily, the easiest to use in that way. They are great for commerce and they are geared towards that. Even something like subscriptions, if you wanted to offer that through Shopify, picking which of the 10 embedded apps to use, to sell a subscription, and understanding whether it is worth paying for that or not, is a major pain in the butt. You would probably be more inclined to go with a site that naturally builds in that functionality. Even that is getting picked apart by vertical because you might have formerly done something on WordPress but now do it on Substack, which is, obviously, a competitor to all these others, as well.

### Why do you think WordPress is really up for grabs?

Analyst 3: WordPress is hard to use. It is not as safe or stable and you have to do a lot of different pieces. There are some people that are verticalizing WordPress, in its own right, where you don’t have to pursue hosting independent of your site development and making it easier. That is part of it being up for grabs. Will someone take what’s largely open source and make it a package that is better and easier to use or will someone who is a truly integrated product just make it better for everyone else involved? It takes time but for every incremental site, WordPress’s share is less than the existing share of sites. It seems as if there is a lot of inertia behind it.

Analyst 5: WordPress is the most dreaded technology according to the Stack Overflow website. That was a few years ago but it was up there with IBM Cloud.

### They still have 60% share in CMS, by my numbers.

Analyst 5: Yes; and their share has been increasing as well.

Analyst 5: CMS has been losing. Some of the websites have no CMS. If you were just writing HTML code, you’re fine.

### How do you look at the economics of Wix’s cohorts?

Analyst 1: I would like to hear others’ view as I have a slightly negative view on Wix’s cohorts. I think the picture has been getting worse, slightly. If you look at contribution profit divided by marketing spend, that has been declining somewhat. I don’t yet have an answer as to why. The second piece is, obviously, gross margins have come down. That is partly because they have got reinvestment in customer service and a couple of other things but it is still a disproportionate fall. That should contribute to higher growth but, basically, for the amount of gross margin fall, there has not been a corresponding step up in growth. The economics have gone slightly worse, over the last year and a half.

### Is that because they are spending too much to acquire B2B business or the DIY business is saturated?

Analyst 4: My light hypothesis on this is, you look at your 30-day and 90-day retention – and this looked very good, especially with Covid – so you spent a lot. But then these businesses found out, maybe we don’t need this after all. It’s not driving anything and they got rid of it again. I think it was a one-time Covid windfall.

Analyst 5: Gross churn hasn’t increased.

Analyst 4: I think it has in the new cohorts. From the payback to marketing, if you look at the curves, they are flattening a lot quicker than the older curves.

Analyst 2: I think a big part of what is going on with the growth slowdown, right now, is the moment of peak cancelation for any cohort is one year after sign up. Most people sign up and prepay for a year. For all these businesses, not just Wix, if you renew for a second year and a third year, you are really sticky for a long time.

If you think about the number between Q2 of 2020 and Q1 of 2021, the four peak Covid quarters, they acquired so many new users. One year later, even if you hold the churn rate constant, the moment of peak cancelation, for that huge number of gross adds during Covid, has been the last four quarters. They have been signing up new users at a more normal pace. If you just imagine your gross adds double overnight – this is just a stylized example – and the churn rate, one year later, stays the same, for everyone, but your gross adds goes back to a more normal level, what you have is this huge surge in growth and then a really significant slowdown. I think that math explains, basically, all of what has happened on the revenue and collections line, in the last couple of quarters.

I think the company did a terrible job explaining that, over the last year. I don’t really see why they should give guidance at all, which I’ve told them. I think it attracts the wrong type of investor. Basically, if you assume that the churn rates stay the same and gross adds stay where they are now, growth is going to rebound a lot, just in the next couple of quarters.

Analyst 1: I see what you’re saying. Obviously, if you have churn at a bigger rate, you have a bigger hole to fill and if your adds go back to a more normalized level, growth in that period will be slower and maybe that is what we are seeing. That still doesn’t fully explain the gross margin slowdown which, to me, indicates that the economics have got slightly worse, unless, for the new customers they are acquiring, the payback is more out in the future.

### At B2B?

Analyst 1: Yes; if that’s true.

### That is my question around these businesses, such as Wix and GoDaddy, who are in a somewhat similar situation. If we look out over the next three, four, five years, or even longer, the percentage of B2B customers in cohorts is going to be completely different from those older cohorts that are generating the cash. What does the unit economics look like when they are acquiring or moving into this do-it-for-me section versus the DIY business? The DIY business is five and a half billion market cap today. How big can this really get? If this is going to be a five bagger or more, they are going to have to move into some kind of enterprise solution, B2B partnership solution, at some point.

Analyst 4: I think you need a fixed cost support structure for B2B and that is what they are building, from what I have understood. How much support do these B2B customers require?

### In terms of customer acquisition, it’s not the same funnel, is it? It’s a different acquisition journey, I assume so, therefore, a different CAC?

Analyst 2: They have a few different strategies for how they are tackling it. This is a business that got to a decent size, without them really even trying which says something; I’m talking about the partners’ business. But some of them just come through partners that prefer to use Wix. I’ve talked to plenty of agencies that hate it and some that love it. It seems as if, for whatever reason, some of the higher-value customers are coming through partners, some are coming through these partnerships that they’ve done, such as with Vistaprint. They say that the economics are as good and that the return on the marketing is as good as it is with their older cohorts.

I think part of what might be different is that these higher-value customers have more of a payments tailwind. If the returns are the same – and let’s just assume the company is correct about that – there is more of a tailwind to growth in these higher-value cohorts because of the payments piece, the ecommerce piece and all these other services that they are offering to these newer type customers, where they are getting a cut of the business revenue, not just a ‘pay me $20 a month for the website’, which is more of what the DIY business is.

The marketing spend to year one collections, that ratio might look less favorable to the company but the long-run return on that investment might be the same or better.

Analyst 1: If you are making the bull case, if I paraphrase what you are saying, the CAC is slightly higher because you have to share some of the economics with the partner. However, the long-term cash flows are going to be higher, comparable to a DIY customer, because you have these guys spending more on the add-on stuff; you have more of the non-subscription stuff. The higher CAC currently means that the economics look a bit depressed but that will more than even out in the future.

### When you look at the ancillary revenue – the add-ons, the payments – do these merchants that work via the agency just want a website? Does the agency have the decision of adding on the payments or is it really the merchant?

Analyst 3: I think I’d push a little more on their lower churn. They’re professional; they’re paying to get a site built, so they are less likely to churn. That gives you more long tail economics, so you can afford to pay more upfront, for those kinds of people. To me, the commercial side is very unproven. In theory, it would make sense that, if you are willing to pay to build a site, versus doing it yourself, it’s more likely that you have something substantial there; it’s less experimental and you are going to stick with it.

Look at Squarespace; there is mid 80s retention. That is probably what the true intention is of paid cohorts at Wix. DIY is like a consumer subscription product, which is fine, but in enterprise you would imagine it is much lower churn.

Analyst 4: On slide 22, at the investor presentation, they showed the current cohorts as they are growing, and the future bookings. I think that is quite a bullish assumption; if you look at what they are servicing, that is deflating. The prices are going down for basic websites but they are thinking that, until 2031, they can get 20% in growth from their current cohorts. I think that is rather optimistic. Any views?

Analyst 5: I’m not sure the prices necessarily go down. The overall ARPU has, I think, been going up. That costs you R&D because you have to add products to drive that ARPU. But generally, it has been going up. They removed the cheapest tier. They used to have a $5 tier and that no longer exists. I don’t know if it’s deflationary but I don’t think there is a huge incentive for incumbents to be deflationary because they have a large base and there is not much growth.

Analyst 2: I think part of the reason why they show that 10-year collections forecast and show that it grows each period, each year, is because of how they calculate their cohorts. Each year, they are signing up 25 to 30 million new users, only a small, small percentage of whom become paying in year one. Some of those churn off over time. If you signed up, in 2021, as a free user and then convert to a paying user four years now, you count in the 2021 cohort.

When you look at their 10-year collections forecast and you see it steadily growing over time, I don’t think what they’re saying is, we’re going to have lots of churns over time but we’re going to be making so much more per user who stays that the net result is going to be growth. There will be a different group of paying users, in any given year’s cohort, five years from now, than there are today.

Analyst 4: If you look at the history, starting 2019, they were not able to grow the cohorts until Q3. You can see this in the historic data. Magically, in Q1, all the cohorts start to grow. For me, it is not a central topic. They are giving some optimistic guidance about their cohorts.

Analyst 5: I would agree. I think, historically, the cohorts have been stable and there is not much growth. There is a stack of presentations of them showing flat featured cohorts and then, all of a sudden, one quarter they decided that they were going to grow. To their credit, the weight of payments and ecommerce is higher now which would probably help.

Analyst 2: Before, they didn’t include payments in their collections forecast, until they had enough data to actually forecast it. I think, pre-Q4 of 2020, when they went from forecasting their collections over eight years, to 10 years, was the time they added ecommerce in. It wasn’t as if they just went from forecasting flat collections from their existing cohorts to significant growth, for no reason. They added a different business line.

The other thing is, it makes a lot of sense that the sorts of users that would sign up, before they had all these ecommerce business solutions functionality, is quite different from the type of user that would sign up after.

### What did you think of the way management communicated last quarter, in the dropping of the guidance and how the market interpreted that?

Analyst 2: I think the way they communicated last quarter made a lot more sense than the previous few. They had got into a cycle where you guide to X percent revenue growth and if you are a little bit above X, it is a good quarter and if you are a little bit below X, it’s a bad quarter. For the way that they run their business, which is trying to build the biggest business they can, 10 years from now, it’s just totally irrelevant. I was happy to drop guidance and I thought they spoke more clearly about their business. They spoke more, externally, the way they talk and think about it internally, than they had in a while. I think that was an improvement.

Analyst 1: I definitely agreed on the fact that I think the guidance is irrelevant. It shouldn’t be a factor for us, and for them too. If you are investing long term, it doesn’t really change anything, in terms of what they say, short term. In terms of the general communication, I think they always try to say something about the volatility in the market that Covid has produced. Needlessly, I think it sounded as if they were trying to put the blame on something else. I didn’t put too much weight on it but it was almost as if, why were they trying to do this. They made it confusing for no reason. It didn’t affect what I think of the business, per se, but makes me wonder, somewhat, about management quality, at some level, or at least communication.

Analyst 1: In terms of Avishai, we looked at it a lot in the start and he’s very motivated and deeply passionate about the business. You could say he is an owner-operator. On the flipside, he doesn’t really own a big amount of shares and they also have a huge amount of stock comp that runs through the income statement, which is a real expense. All that weighs in with the fact that he is a passionate guy that has built this business and I think he really has a view to make this business one where 50% of all websites were built on Wix.

Even if they come a little close to that, then this will be a big home run. On the other side, you have these things that are not great, such as not having a heavy stock ownership by the founder and there is a huge stock comp which has been increasing. I don’t know if anybody else has views on those high-level alignment topics.

Analyst 3: I wanted to say one more thing on the call that I thought was standout, which is their emphasis on the investment periods gradually rolling off and they’re finally going to show what core margins are and what they are capable of. I think that’s constructive to see because I do feel as if there is this overhang, questioning whether they are even getting ROI on these investments. To be able to finally say, this is the level of return that they are realizing, achieving and seeing that follow through would answer and settle some of the questions about their degree of alignment.

In some ways, their incentives were more geared towards driving growth at all costs, than to necessarily be prudent and harvest some of what is really a very cash-generative business. That really stood out to me from the call. There were several points where they emphasized that.

### They guide 8% to 10% free cash flow margin in 2023, I think. But if you exclude stock-based comp, it’s basically negative.

Analyst 3: It’s better than it had been. The direction is the right direction.

Analyst 5: The margin question is even more relevant at this point, considering the stock is on something like 3X revenue. You can do the math and think about what the sustainable margins are and if you think they can make anything close to 30s in gap operating profit, you end up with a very low normalized margin. If you buy their idea that the core margins are like that, then fine. They can invest for a few years and, if it works, great; if it doesn’t work, shut it down and start milking the existing business.

Something that I didn’t quite understand or could square, is the Squarespace guidance. They had their long-term financial targets and I thought their margin targets were appallingly low. I don’t know if anyone had any view on why because we have 20s on leveraged free cash flow margin and stock comp is probably 10% of revenue, if not more, so it’s in the 10s, which is way too low.

Analyst 3: And it didn’t tie out. At the end of the call, they said, “Oops; we’ve got to revisit this.”

Analyst 2: That was not good.

Analyst 5: I noticed that too and it doesn’t inspire confidence. I know Wix told us theirs were higher but I wondered if people had any view of how to validate this. To me, that’s pretty key, if you can get comfort on the profitability side.

Analyst 3: They give some good disclosures and help you try to get there with how they illustrate their cohorts. But they were emphatic on the last call that they were certainly higher than 20% free cash flow core business margin. Literally, the only way is to go and show it. I think Modest Proposal has a great tweet about Amazon where, as much as everyone talks about how they’ve invested through margin, the whole time, every so often, they’d show a little leg for a couple of quarters. It would be like, this is what we could do and they’d blow away your expectation for profitability, for one quarter, and then go back to investing.

I don’t think it’s as simple as saying, we have a really long runway and we’re going to invest forever. Unless, of course, you’re the owner-operator, with your own class of shares and you don’t have to care about Wall Street. But if you do have to care about that, the stock right now, as far as I’m concerned, is saying, prove to me that you’ve got margin. Don’t prove to me that you can grow; prove to me that you’ve got margin and give us a return from that. To me, the question is, can they prove it?

Analyst 1: A big part of that is the stock-based comp which, at least right now, is significant. Normally, you would expect, as they get larger, to see leverage on that line item and it goes, maybe, under 10%. Directionally, over the last two years, that has not been going in the right direction. Although two years is a relatively short timeframe, you would want to see that turn and go under 10, to have a reasonably good shot. Some while back, they published 30% non-gap margins. If you take 10% off stock-based comp, that gives you a 20% normalized margin. Then again, as you say, they need to prove it.

Analyst 2: I’m curious as to what everyone thinks of the following math. They disclose in their 20-F each year and they go back and forth between calling it user acquisition cost and advertising. If you believe that the existing cohorts will be at least flat, or slightly growing, then you could argue that all of that user acquisition cost that they give you in the filings, is a subset of sales and marketing. I’m not adding back all of sales and marketing; I’m only adding back the user acquisition costs.

If you take reported free cash flow, plus user acquisition cost, minus stock comp, that number, as a percentage of collections, was between the mid-20s and low-30s, up until the last year. Of course, you are adding back something that is over 20% of collections but what I’m not doing there is adding back any R&D; I’m not assuming that any of the R&D is accessed then. I’m also not assuming that anything in sales and marketing, other than just the actual ad spend, is growth spend.

Then again, I think that stock comp, as a percentage of revenue, is not going to stay at 15%, 16%, 17% forever. They have been in a huge hiring cycle. My understanding is that I don’t think they pay huge retention bonuses in stock. They give people grants when they are hired, mostly in the R&D function and invest over four years. The run rate number there should be quite a bit lower.

I welcome anyone to attack any of the assumptions that I am making there. But they all feel reasonable, to me.

Analyst 1: When you add back the marketing – and that’s also how I look at it if you want to get to a normalized owners’ earnings – how much of that marketing number are you adding back, as a rough percentage?

Analyst 2: If you look at their 20-F, they give you a number that, in some years, they call user acquisition costs and, other years, they call advertising. But they are the same number, each year, regardless of what they are calling it. Take 2020 – because they haven’t filed a 20-F yet – where the user acquisition cost number was 283 million and the sales and marketing line was 438. I’m just adding back that 283; reported free cash flow plus user acquisition cost, minus stock comp. That number, as a percentage of collections, was 24%, in 2020.

Analyst 1: I think, directionally, that makes sense to me. Wouldn’t you say you don’t have to add back the full amount, because you have to fill the leaky bucket, in the sense that, whoever you didn’t retain, you have to spend some money to get you back to 100, unless you are assuming you are not losing any customers.

Analyst 2: The reason why the cohorts show positive net revenue retention, over time, is because, in a given year, they might sign up 30 million users and 2% of those might be paying in year one. Some percent of those cancel over time but some percent of the free users convert to paying. If a free user, who signed up in 2021, converts to paying in 2025, they count in the 2021 cohort. It is that tailwind of the conversion of free to paying, over time, which fills that bucket.

Assuming the collections from the cohorts will be at least flat to growing, with no additional marketing spend, those users are already in the door. They’re just not paying; 97%, 98% of them aren’t paying.

Analyst 1: I think I looked at it the same way and, by and large, agree but I would be curious in hearing whether others have thoughts on that?

Analyst 5: It seems reasonable to me. That is also how we used to look at it. The only wrinkle is that that metric has been deteriorating recently. If you subtract the same percentage of S&M – which they haven’t disclosed yet as the 20-F is not out – then you see the economics deteriorating.

I don’t know if anyone listened to that Orlando Bravo podcast, where he said that when they try to grow the software businesses, they also try to instill discipline around making a profit. They don’t let the businesses just run at a loss, forever and ever, because the management teams then get into the mindset of having to grow and they can run whatever loss they want. I wonder if the issue here could be that you have a management team that is not disciplined in deciding when to invest.

I know they say that the return on marketing is the same, but I don’t know if the numbers stack up on that. Maybe the return on marketing is the same but, clearly, their return on R&D hasn’t been the same.

Analyst 2: I don’t think that’s clear.

Analyst 5: That the return hasn’t been the same? Yes, it could be shifted; you’re right.

Analyst 2: I’m not saying you’re wrong, I just don’t think it’s as easy as saying that R&D has gone up a lot and you haven’t yet seen the increase in revenue or collections or new users that you would need to see to justify that. There is a step function change required in customer support, R&D, site performance and all that stuff, and it shows up across the P&L, in different places. It’s a step function change required in investment, to serve the new market that they are trying to go after.

Analyst 5: I agree. It’s like building a new product so you have a lot of fixed costs.

Analyst 2: That’s actually a really good way of saying it.

Analyst 5: The proof is going to be in the pudding. How long do you want to give them? Two years? Three years? Four years? At a certain point, either the growth has to pick up or the margin has to pick up. The bear case here is that they invested and those investments turn out to be unsuccessful, at which point, you have to wonder whether their reaction is going to that is they are going to invest more, because it means the product wasn’t good enough, or maybe they’re not going to invest more.

Analyst 4: Does anyone see the risk of them selling it at a low price, to private equity to get the CEO a private equity contract? Basically, it’s a device to get the share price down.

### Are you suggesting he is going to sell to private equity?

Analyst 2: Do you think he’s trying to drive the price down to sell the company at a lower price?

Analyst 3: He’s a victim of his environment.

Analyst 4: I’ve seen this a couple of times. They have the idea but, once the share price goes down and private equity gives him a call, these managers get the idea. Do you think he’s one of those?

Analyst 3: I would say, look at any perceived Covid winner and their stat chart is identical. I don’t think there is anything that management could or could not have done, even in communicating better, that would have changed their fate at this point. If they were intent on selling to private equity, they probably would not have said they were going to double their free cash flow margin next year, even if it’s from a small base. He would probably have said something like, we’re going to continue our investment period into the next year. They’re right in the middle of every one of these perceived Covid winners.

Analyst 1: I think the Man Group, who were their big backers, which was private equity, if I’m not mistaken, they still have a significant stake.

Analyst 4: I’m not sure; I can ask someone.

Analyst 2: I know I’m repeating myself here, but I’m curious to get anyone to attack this logic. They didn’t give topline guidance on the call, for anything beyond Q1 but they were really specific about a few things. My sense from talking to them – and maybe I’m whistling past the graveyard – is that they really, really, really don’t want to end up in another year where they’ve been specific about stuff and they fall short. I think they’ve changed how they think about that, internally.

They were really specific that ARPU was going to grow double digits, this year and next. My contention is, the biggest reason that revenue and collections have slowed down is because applying a constant churn rate to the Covid cohorts has led to significantly slower net adds in the last few quarters – same thing this quarter – and that that situation significantly reverses, as this year goes on.

If ARPU does actually grow double digits and their net adds look anything like how they looked pre-Covid – they also said that gross adds are running at 15% or 20% ahead of pre-Covid – then their revenue growth, company wide topline this year, could be 20%. By Q4, the year over year, could be 23%, 24%, 25%. What it would take for this business to go from their Q1 guide of 12% growth, for them to growing 25%, by the end of this year, is nothing other than they were right on their ARPU and net adds look like they were, pre-Covid. I’m talking about net adds in absolute numbers which means, in percent terms, a significant slowdown to what they were doing pre-Covid.

Analyst 1: I agree; that’s why we own it.

Analyst 2: I was beginning to wonder why you owned it?

### Do you have specific questions or anything you would like to raise on how you are thinking about Wix or the space more broadly?

Analyst 6: I guess, the whole margin question is a fascinating one that we’re seeing with a lot of SaaS businesses. The shift from caring about growth to now caring about a blend of growth and profitability is very clear, industry wide. I don’t know if you’ve touched on this already, but thinking a bit about the competitive landscape. Webflow is very much coming onto my radar. I’m fairly new to Wix, so please excuse me if this is a basic thing to be talking about. If feels as if, in Wix’s two future growth avenues, (a) ecommerce and (b) the do-it-for-me market, it’s coming up against Shopify in the first bucket and the likes of Webflow and the incumbent, WordPress, in the second bucket. I’d just be fascinated to hear views on how people might think about their execution capabilities against some of these different players.

Analyst 5: We mentioned Webflow before and, clearly, this is not a winner-takes-all business. If Webflow is our only concern, competitively, then it’s quite good. There is a lot of white space and market share they can take from WordPress, which is quite bad. Do people use BuiltWith? They have nice statistics about number of websites. If you look at the top 10 million websites, Wix is doing much better than Webflow, because Webflow is much larger websites. If you look at the top 100K websites, Webflow looks like they have around 1.2K, while Wix has around 600. They are probably about half the size, on the large websites. It’s still decent and both Wix and Webflow have been growing very nicely in the top one million plus websites, which I guess is a reasonable proxy for professional websites.

### Are they mainly ecommerce websites? What type of websites or merchants are they?

Analyst 5: I don’t know; you could probably find out by cross checking what other technologies are in there.

Analyst 3: I guess one question to ask, to riff off this and maybe get where we wanted to get to earlier, is part of why I’ve been so focused on Webflow and what Wix could do in the agency space is this question about, did Covid pull forward DIY demand and you eventually get back to steady state? Or did it pull the development of websites closer to a maturity endpoint? Now, does every restaurant or every doctor, who would ever have a site, have a site and you’re going to have more than just a wait it out, to get back to trend? Or are you going to have this degree where it’s now a pretty mature industry and DIY doesn’t have much further juice to squeeze?

Analyst 5: To me, Wix was always a market share gain story, as opposed to a situation where websites are growing and they are riding the trend of website creation. These small websites have a lot of churn anyway, so in theory, if your share of new website wins is higher, then you should generate growth by gaining market share more than by growing the total number of websites.

Analyst 3: But churn is inherently different. It’s not as if someone leaves one service for another. It’s more that a website perishes and you need someone to have a reason to start a new website.

Analyst 5: It’s like all the bakeries close and a new bakery opens; different website.

Analyst 3: The share gain is nice but the structural growth was probably a bigger portion of their total.

Analyst 5: You can see that total .com domain registrations have never been particularly high; high single digits, I think.

Analyst 3: But the paid sites are pretty good, over the last decade.

Analyst 5: Yes, but what would be the concern? What do you think got to the top? I think about it that there are a certain amount of websites, that has been growing and the market share of Wix, within that, should grow too. Which one are you worried is not going to grow anymore?

Analyst 3: The number of websites.

Analyst 5: My point is, that that number of websites is a reasonably small contribution.

### You can see, from Verisign, that .com domain growth is 4% or 5% anually.

Analyst 5: That’s right, the .com.

### I agree that it’s not a massive hurdle for Wix to outperform the current growth rate that they are at. One thing that was mentioned, talking about the long-term economics and the margin, is if the cohorts are the same, the big question I have is, what makes you comfortable that Wix is going to earn a similar unit economics in new cohorts, as they do expand into these new areas; potentially, ecommerce and do-it-for-me?

Analyst 2: I think the types of users that they are signing up now are, in important respects, different in that they are more valuable and have a longer tail of growth attached to them than the types of users they were signing up two, three or four years ago. The payments business didn’t even exist three years ago.

### Are these not ecommerce merchants that they are actually focused on, on the partner side?

Analyst 2: If you look at what they announced last week, in terms of their plugin with Amazon, that is very much focused on the ecommerce type users. That is a direct attack on Shopify. I just think that they have so many different ways to win and it’s a management team that is really focused on all of them. You can debate the merits of that. Maybe they try everything and they succeed at nothing.

What they define as partners’ revenue, which I think is just revenue from users who have built more than one site on Wix – it’s an imperfect definition but at least it’s something specific and consistent over time – that’s 200% growth in that revenue, in two years. Again, it’s hard to get reliable data on private companies but Webflow’s run rate revenue – at least according to a recent Forbes article – is $100 million. Wix’s partners’ revenue, in the last year, was two and a half times that and this is in a segment of the market that they’ve only started going after aggressively, in the last year or two.

### It’s not clear how much of that is from Vistaprint or NTT.

Analyst 2: The Vistaprint deal didn’t close until recently, so there was none of that in 2021.

### Was the NTT deal before Vistaprint?

Analyst 2: It was. I forget exactly when that was.

Analyst 4: I think a bit of the problem is that gross profit is not really disclosed, in terms of variable cost basis. I don’t know why the company is making so hard to understand it.

Analyst 1: On that point, just to compare, Xero’s reporting on similar SaaS metrics is, I think, much more clear. I’ve communicated to IR that there could be improvements on how they report because, as we know, right now, we are trying to parse through what is really true.

Analyst 4: As they do the hosting, support structures, onboarding and what have you, I think it’s somewhere in the 60s, low-70s, then in the 80s, upper 80s, but that’s just an educated guess.

### Does anyone else have a specific question around competition or looking at that long-term margin question, for Wix, more specifically in the new B2B space? The other question is, do they really need to crack B2B, to make the stock work here?

Analyst 5: Not if they show the margins.

### Any more questions or anything to raise around Wix or Squarespace? We haven’t talked much about Squarespace, apart from them messing up last quarter.

Analyst 6: I just had one more on Wix which is, I guess, people related. Speaking to some of the ex-Israel based employees, it very much seems as if it’s a mark of quality to have worked at Wix, on anyone’s CV, but there are some suggestions that that might be waning, given the competition for talent in Israel. I know they have a lot of employees around the world but Israel still seems to be the core. Are they any insights into talent attraction or retention that anyone might have?

Analyst 1: When we, initially, looked at Wix, we spoke to a number of ex or current employees and I think their view was very similar. It was like working at Google, in Israel. It was a stamp and highly-regarded. More recently, I don’t have an update on that, but I wonder, if you get a bunch of stock comp and the stock goes down a lot then, obviously, you have a different feeling about how great the company is. I don’t know how much that contributes to the current general feeling, with a public company.

Analyst 5: There is clearly increased competition for talent, in Tel Aviv, which is why they have a big office in Ukraine. They told us that it’s tough to recruit talent. Five years ago, you either worked at Google or Wix or Facebook and they were all on the same plane. Now, there are so many other startups in Israel.

Analyst 4: They threw out everyone from Ukraine, one or two weeks before the war started. I was surprised they didn’t mention it on the earnings call because I think it was a good topic, for them.

Analyst 3: Although power to them for acting without speaking.

### Anything else anyone wants to raise, before we start wrapping up?

Analyst 5: I’m still mesmerized by the Squarespace margin targets. Maybe we should just ask them.
