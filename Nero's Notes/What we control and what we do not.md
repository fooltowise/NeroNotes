# What we can control and what we cannot
> Some things are in our control, while others are not. We control our opinion, choice, desire, aversion, and, in a word, everything in our own doing. We don't control our body, property, reputation, position, and, in a word, everything not of our own doing. Even more, the things in our control are by nature free, unhindered, and unobstructed, while those not in our control are weak, slavish, can be hindered, and are not our own. Epictetus, _Enchiridion_

We never control the external events that happen. What we can control is **our opinion about those events**. We don't control the situation, but we decide what we think about it.

A good understanding of what is within my control provides real clarity about the world: all I have is my own mind.
