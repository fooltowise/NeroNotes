# The Sophistication of your market - How many products have been there before you?


How many similar products have your prospects been told about before? This question is easily answered. A few hours of research should give you samples of every competing ad in the field - if there are any.

## If you are first in your market

If there are not - if you are the first in your particular market, with your particular product - then you are dealing with prospects that have no sophistication about your product at all. In other words, they have never received any information about such a product before. Once you get them interested, they are likely to become much more enthusiastic, believe much more of what you have to say, and buy much more readily. Remember, your story is brand-new to them.

This, of course, is the dream of every manufacturer and every copy writer. *To be first.* And it happens quite often today. Sometimes because of a technological breakthrough - creating a new product (women's hair sprays), or a radically better product (long-playing records), or a familiar product at an explosively low price (the Model T Ford).

And sometimes, such a brand-new market is created by the insight of an advertising man, dealing with an already-established product. In this case, the ad man visualises the application of the product to an entirely different market (the switch, in the Twenties, of Ovaltine from an aid for insomnia to a body builder for skinny children).

Or he reaches that market through a hitherto untapped medium (Revlons fabulous results from sponsorship of the $64'000 Question in the early days of TV).

Or he discovers a previously unnoticed performance of his product that carries it completely beyond the limits of its old market (Lifebuoy's discovery that people would accept its strong medicinal odor as a cure for perspiration odor, and their subsequent christening of that odor with the catch-word "B.O").

When such a golden opportunity - to be the first - presents itself, you are probably dealing with a market in its third or fourth stage of awareness. Your prospects know that they would like what your product does, or they would like to get rid of the problem your product solves - if it were only possible.

Here, the answer to your third question is simple. You are dealing with a market where you are first. Therefore they have no previous information about similar products. Therefore they are completely unsophisticated.

And your exploitation of this answer - your strategy in approaching this market - is equally simple:

*Be simple. Be direct. Above all, don't be fancy. 'Same either the need or the claim in your headline - nothing more. Dramatise that claim in your copy - make it as powerful as possible. And then bring in your product; and prove that it works.*


Nothing more - because nothing more is needed. To illustrate, let's look at one of the most profitable, insatiable, constantly renewing, and therefore overworked field in marketing history: the reducing field. No one knows who was the first man to stumble on the reducing field (though it is fairly certain that he must have become a millionaire). But all he had to say in his headline as a simple statement of the direct desire of millions of women:

				NOW! LOSE UGLY FAT!

As he started to clean up, others inevitably followed. But, by this time, the reducing field had already been tapped. Advertisements had been run. The direct claim had been made. Mere repetition would no longer be enough. In other words, the reducing market was now in its Second Stage of sophistication. A new approach was necessary. The strategy had to be changed.

## If you're second, do this

If you're second, and the direct claim is still working - *then copy that successful claim - but enlarge on it. Drive it to the absolute limit. Outbid your competition.*

For example, here are two successful headlines in the now fiercely competitive reducing field that did just that. They have both been pushed to the outer limits of both legality and believability. But they both worked.

				LOSE UP TO 47 POUNDS IN 4 WEEKS OR RECEIVE $40 BACK!


				I AM 61 POUNDS LIGHTER... NEVER A HUNGRY MINUTE


In most fields, this enlarged-claim technique reaches the outer limits in successive stages. Sometimes the completion of this process takes years. In the home garden field, as another example, an advertiser brought out a Floribunda Rose - using this headline with startling success:

				PICK 25-50-100 ROSES FROM THIS ONE MAGNIFISCENT PLANT!

It worked. And so, some years later, a special variety of cushion mum swept the country with this headline: 

				SIX HUNDRED MUMS FROM A SINGLE BUSH!

And, one year later, this headline carried the process to what are probably the absolute limits of Mother Nature:

			WHO EVER HEARD OF 17'000 BLOOMS FROM A SINGLE PLANT?

As simple as this evolution looks, it produces results. It provided a tremendous lift to car sales in the 1950s, when 50 more horsepower was added to the advertisements every year. It was climaxed in the Chrysler 300 - a car named after its horsepower rating - and pegged just at the limit of believability, practicality, and the inevitable public reaction.

For the reaction *will* come. Toward the end, the process disintegrates. The successful claim is overworked; enlargement piles on enlargement. New competitors enter the field - each trying to promise more. Headlines double and triple in size. Words begin to lose their meaning - "Whiter than whites" appear. The prospect becomes confused - then skeptical. Believability is shattered; claims are automatically discounted 50% by their readers. More promise is poured in to compensate. The government begins to investigate. And the sales curve begins to turn down down down.

## The third stage of competition

At this point, your market has entered into its Third Stage of Sophistication. Your prospects have now heard all the claims - all the extremes. Perhaps they have even bought one or two competitive products. Every time they open a newspaper, another similar headline screams out at them. *How are they to distinguish one product from the mass? How do you break through to reach them?*

One factor is vital here. That is the restorative power of the market you are dealing with. It may be a market based on a constantly recurring mass instinct, such as reducing. It may be a market based on an unsolved technological problem, such as spark plug replacement. It may be a market that periodically wished to renew or improve its purchases, such as cars, homes, appliances.

In all these cases, the desire never fades; the market continually renew itself. New prospects come into the market. Old customers become dissatisfied with their old purchases, their old solutions, and begin to look again. The mass desire - the tremendous profit potential - still exists. *But it cannot be tapped by the old, simple methods any longer.*

Women still want to lose weight. But by now they've read dozens of ads for reducing aids - all promising to take off 20, 30, 40 pounds in a matter of weeks. They no longer fully believe them. Perhaps they believe these ads so little that they won't even try a new product at all. For months, even years, they may simply accept their overweight condition as "something that just can't be helped."

But the desire never fades. The dissatisfaction build up, month after month. Secretly, perhaps even unconsciously, these women are hoping to find a *new* product - a new headline -  that promises them a new way to satisfy that age-old desire.

And on this fundamental fact, we build our strategy for selling in a market in its Third Stage of Sophistication.

*If your market is a the stage where they've heard all the claims, in all their extremes, then mere repetition or exaggeration won't work any longer. What this market needs now is a new device to make all these old claims become fresh and believable to them again. In other words, a NEW MECHANISM - a new way to making the old promise work. A different process - a fresh chance - a brand new possibility of success where only disappointment has resulted before.*

Here the emphasis shifts from what the product does to HOW it works. Not accomplishment, but performance becomes dominant. The headline expands. The claim remains - but now it is reinforced by the mechanism that accomplishes it. In the reducing field, for example, the limits of its basic promise had been reached by headlines like this:

			I AM 61 POUNDS LIGHTER... NEVER A HUNGRY MINUTE

Now new leaders emerge - avoiding the competition of claims - stressing mechanism instead, like this:

			FLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY!

or

			FIRST WONDER DRUG FOR REDUCING!

A vital change has taken place in both these ads - and in every ad that deals successfully with this Third Stage of sophistication. In the previous, second stage ads, the entire headline was taken up by a complete statement of the main claim. Below it, in smaller type, in either a subhead or the body copy, came the mechanism that accomplished the claim. Often, this mechanism was abbreviated - simply mentioned instead of being explained - indicated by a sort of shorthand, like this:

				I AM 61 POUNDS LIGHTER... NEVER A HUNGRY MINUTE
		Read the astonishing experience of New York Food Expert with the *famous Eat-and-Reduce Plan*

In third stage ads, however, this arrangement is completely reversed. By the time, the basic claim has become well-known to almost all its prospects - perhaps even too well-known. Therefore, this shorthand can be applied to the claim itself. What was before a five to ten word headline describing nothing but the basic claim - "I AM 61 POUNDS LIGHTER"  - Hint - can be communicated in a single word in a headline devoted to explaining how this claim is accomplished. For instance:

			FLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY!

or

			FIRST WONDER DRUG FOR REDUCING!


First the mechanism is brought into the headline to establish a point of difference - to make the old claims fresh and believable again. And then - once the prospect is told that here is a brand new chance for success - *then the claim can be restated in full, to make sure that she realises everything she is getting.* Like this:

				FLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY!
			Released for the first time! The amazing scientific discovery that melts up to 37 pounds off men and women - without starvation diets, without a single hungry moment - without even giving up the foods you love!

Or - using the same third stage arrangement of mechanism in the headline, and claim elaborated in the lead paragraph - we have this ad:

			FIRST WONDER DRUG FOR REDUCING!
		Used successfully by thousands of physicians! Lose as many pounds as you like without diets, without exercise, without giving up the kinds of food you love to eat!

In both these ads - and all others like them - the promise itself is subordinated to the mechanism which accomplishes that promise. This mechanism is featured in the headline. When ads such as these are successful, you are dealing with a market that is in its third stage of sophistication.

## The fourth stage

But you are still in a competitive market, and such ads give only a temporary advantage. Such ads, presenting a new promise, begin a new trend. Within a few months, the third stage of sophistication passes into a fourth stage - a new stage of elaboration and enlargement. But this time, the elaboration is concentrated on the mechanism, rather than on the promise - like this:

		FIRST NO-DIET REDUCING WONDER DRUG!

This fourth stage strategy can be summarized like this:
*If a competitor has just introduced a new mechanism to achieve the same claim as that performed by your product, and that new-mechanism announcement is producing sales, then you counter in this way. Simply elaborate or enlarge upon the successful mechanism. Make it easier, quicker, surer, allow it to solve more of the problem; overcome old limitations; promise extra benefits. You are beginning a stage of embellishment similar to the second stage of sophistication described above. The same strategy will be effective here.*

But, unfortunately, so will the same limitations. The fourth stage of sophistication, like the second stage which it resembles, eventually pushed itself out of the realm of believability. At this point, further elaborations become ineffective. You are then faced with two alternatives:

First, discovering a new, acceptable mechanism to make the promise fresh and believable again. But remember, the mechanism you use must not only be new and legitimate, but it must be accepted as believable and significant by your market. Each third and fourth stage that precedes you, makes this problem of acceptance more and more difficult.

Eventually, of course, no new mechanism will gain acceptance. The market will have grown tired of your promises and the mechanisms by which they are accomplished. Your prospects will have been glutted by advertising. You will have reached the fifth stage of sophistication - the most difficult - where the field is said to be exhausted - where competitors are dropping out of the market en masse.

## How to revive a "dead" product

In this final stage of sophistication, your market no longer believes in your advertising, and therefore no longer wishes to be aware of your product. In many ways, therefore, this fifth stage of sophistication corresponds to the fifth stage of awareness discussed in [[Your prospect's state of awareness]]. The problems are the same. The emphasis shifts from the promise and the mechanism which accomplishes it, to identification with the prospect himself. You are dealing here with the problem of brining your prospect into your ad - not through desire - but through identification.

An outstanding example of a product which had lost its market because of such a fifth stage of sophistication, and then gained it back by a brilliant  use of the identification headline, is the Postum ad discussed in [[Your prospect's state of awareness]], and its headline, "WHY MEN CRACK..."


## Let's look at an industry that went through all five stages of sophistication

But perhaps the classic example of an industry which encountered all five stages of sophistication - and overcame them - is the cigarette industry. The history of cigarette advertising is a continuous battle against competition, against physical and social taboos, even against the very success of its own current advertising; which saturates and exhausts the market by the weight of its combined industry expenditures, and constantly demands new approaches.

Let's briefly examine the main current of cigarette advertising first - the progression from the first to the fifth stages of sophistication - and then discuss some fo the side problems it encountered.

In the first stage of sophistication, when the market was new, cigarette advertising featured taste, enjoyment, pleasure in the headline.

				I'D WALK A MILE FOR A CAMEL!


				CHESTERFIELD - THEY SATISFY!

This raw promise of enjoyment gradually became elaborated an embellished to push it to the limits of believability. In this second stage, since you cannot measure the pleasure a cigarette gives you, the promise-growth took the form of broader and broader comparisons:

				LIGHT UP A LUCK, AND YOU WON'T MISS THE SWEETS THAT MAKE YOU FAT!

But, without measurement, the limits of enlargement are soon reached. So third stage strategy began to be employed - a continuous stream of brilliant new mechanisms:

				LUCKIES - THEY'RE TOASTED

				PALL MALL'S GREATER LENGTH FILTERS THE SMOKE FURTHER!


				CAMEL - PROTECT YOUR T-ZONE!


And, as each of these mechanisms was accepted by the buying public, the originators competitors adopted the mechanism and began to elaborate on it - initiating the fourth stage:

				PHILIP MORRIS - ALL THE HARSHNESS BAKED OUT!
				CHESTERFIELD - REGULAR AND KING-SIZED TOO!
				NINE OUT OF TEN DOCTORS PREFER CAMEL!

But eventually the mechanisms lost their potency, and the government ruled out the health claims, and in the early fifties the industry faced a fifth stage market. But a new marketing tool - motivation research - had shown them how to reach this market without mechanisms and claims, without even headlines, simply by projecting strong visual identifications with the virility that the public had accepted in a cigarette. For example, any of the Marlboro "Virile Men" ads. Or their imitations in Chesterfield, or Camel ads.

Thus we have the full spectrum of sophistication confronting an industry. But cigarette advertisers also encountered two critical side problems. The first offered them the opportunity of doubling their market. The second, of retaining that huge market in the face of the most adverse publicity.

The first challenge occurred immediately following WWI. By this time the old "Coffin Nails" taboo had been forgotten - for men. But there still remained the equally great potential market of women smokers - if smoking could be made respectable for women. The trend was definitely in that direction - the urge, the curiosity existed in millions of women in all social classes. Some respectable women were actually daring to smoke in public.

But the trend - left by itself - would take years to develop. An advertisement had to be created to accelerate that trend. To make smoking for women not only acceptable, but desirable. To channel the vast movement toward liberation and equality of the Twenties as the driving force to open up this huge new market. 

But such an advertisement could never come right out and suggest that women smoke. It could not even show a woman smoking. Such an advertisement was definitely a fifth stage problem - a problem of identification. And it was solved by linking a man and a woman in their most appealing connection - in love - with a smoking situation. The ad showed a young couple, sitting together on a beach on a moonlit night. He is just lighting up a cigarette - the first puffs of smoke are just drifting into the moonlight. She has her face turned toward his, and her words make up the entire headline (and, except for the logo, the entire ad):

				BLOW SOME MY WAY

Nothing more needed to be said. A vast new market - opened up with four words.

The second challenge occurred thirty years later. This was the cancer scare of the early fifties, which continues into today. It resulted in four reactions: first, there were cigarette holders, water pipes, ceramic filter, etc. - None of which succeeded in establishing a national market, since they represented too much inconvenience, too blatant an admission that the purchaser was worried about his smoking.

Secondly, the scare produced a determined effort in the industry itself to conduct its own research, to counteract or correct such claims.

Third, it produced a temporary drop in cigarette sales.

And, fourth, it opened up a vast new market for an already existing product - the filter cigarette - aided by the industry itself, which wisely gambled that smokers would not move out of cigarettes, but simply into a different kind of cigarette.

Filter cigarettes had always existed, as a small, specialty market. But now they were expanded into a mass market.  Millions of new prospects, who had never before even considered filter cigarettes, now sought out information about them, asked to be told which one to buy. A new market opened up. And it started to retrace the same stages of sophistication as its parent market had passed through fifty years before.


First stage:

			KENT'S MICRONITE FILTER TRAPS TARS BEFORE THEY REACH YOUR LIPS

Second stage:

			20'000 FILTER TRAPS IN VICEROY!

Third Stage:

			PARLIAMENT - THE MOST IMPORANT V* INCH IN SMOKING TODAY - NO FILTER FEEDBACK!

Fourth Stage:

			TAREYTON - DUAL FILTER FOR DOUBLE THE PLEASURE!

and the Fifth Stage - in an industry-wide stroke of genius - right back to the flavour again:

			WINSTON TASTES GOOD LIKE A CIGARETTE SHOULD!
			IT'S WHAT'S UP FRONT THAT COUNTS!
			L&M HAS FOUND THE SECRET THAT UNLOCKS THE FLAVOR!


And so it goes. Industry after industry. The same life cycle for each market. The same deadly  challenges. The same willingness to adapt rather than perish.
