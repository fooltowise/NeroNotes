# Munger's Critique of Accountants

### Demise of Ethics Among the Major Accounting Firms
When I was younger, the major accounting firms were quite ethical places, and nobody got filthy rich. But in the space of twenty-five years, they sold out to terrible behavior, one little step at a time. Once you start doing something bad, then it's easy to take the next step - and in the end, you're a moral sewer. The idea that the major accounting firms of the country would sell obviously fraudulent tax shelters...

Too many law and accounting firms get roped into shady things. For example, tax shelters, with their contingency fees and secrecy, are a total abomination.

You'll better understand the evil of top audit firms starting to sell fraudulent tax shelters when I tell you that one told me that they're better (than the others) because they only sold the schemes to their top twenty clients, so no one would notice.

### Aggressive Accounting

We're so horrified by aggressive accounting (that is rampant in Corporate America) that we reach for ways to be conservative. It helps our business decisions and protects Berkshire. How did we get in situations where we're all so close to the line?

Creative accounting is an absolute curse to civilization. One could argue that double-entry bookkeeping was one of history's great advances. Using accounting for fraud and folly is a disgrace. In a democracy, it often takes a scandal to trigger reform. Enron was the most obvious example of a business culture gone wrong in a long, long time.

### Misuse of EBITDA
I think that, every time you see the word EBITDA, you should substitute the words "bullshit earnings."

### Arthur Andersen
I regard what happened to the innocent employees of Arthur Andersen as very unfair, but capitalism without failure is like religion without hell. When it gets this bad and there's lack of systems for control - which Arthur Andersen didn't have - maybe a firm should just go down.

We couldn't do anything that would bring down Berkshire. Arthur Andersen was particularly vulnerable because it was a partnership. A partnership must be extra careful in its behavior, choosing clients, etc.

### The scandal of American Pension Fund accounting
The current practice of using unrealistically high assumptions for pension plan returns is a dumb and improper way to handle things. But if you talk to management, their eyes glaze over even before hostility comes.

Pension fund accounting is drifting into scandal by using unrealistic assumptions. It's human nature to extrapolate the recent past into the future, but it's terrible that managements go along with this.

IBM just raised its return expectations for its pension fund to ten percent. Most companies are at nine percent. We think six percent is more realistic. Company leaders may believe it - they're honest people - but subconsciously they believe it because they want to believe it. It makes earnings good so they can promote the stock.

> The reason accountants don't say anything is best summed up by the saying "Whose bread I eat, his song I sing." I think you're getting very foolish numbers in America accounting. I don't think it's willful dishonesty, but it might as well be.


### Bad accounting leads to immorality
People who have loose accounting standards are just inviting perfectly horrible behavior in other people. And it's a sin, it's an absolute sin. If you carry bushel baskets full of money through the ghetto, and made it easy to steal, that would be a considerable human sin because you'd be causing a lot of bad behavior, and the bad behavior would spread. Similarly, an institution that uses sloppy accounting commits a real human sin, and it's also a dumb way to do business.
