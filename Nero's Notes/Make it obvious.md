# Make it Obvious
- With enough practice, the brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it
- Once the habit becomes automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing
- The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.
- Pointing and Calling raises your level of awareness from a non-conscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions
- The habits scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.


- The first Law of behavior change is _Make it obvious_
- the two most common cues are time and location
- Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location
- The implementation intention formula is : I will [Behavior] at [Time] in [Location]
- Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit
- The habit stacking formula is: After [Current Habit], I will [New Habit]


- Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time
- Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out
- Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment
- Gradually your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the clue.
- It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues

- The inversion of the 1st law of Behavior Change is _make it invisible_
- **Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten**
- People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It's easier to avoid temptation than to resist it
- One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.
- Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.
