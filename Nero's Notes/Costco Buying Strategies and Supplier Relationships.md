### Tell us about your role and responsibilities of a buyer at Costco?

I worked for Costco for 19 years, partly in operations but mainly in the buying organization at Costco Canada. I was responsible for both food and non-food categories including confectionery, snacks, frozen food, pet food and cleaning equipment. I also did consumer electronics, appliances and automotive, so I touched a wide range of categories during my 13 years in the buying organization at Costco.

### How is the buying organization at Costco structured?

It is split into two segments, national and regional buying. Large countries, like the US or Canada, have both whereas smaller countries like Japan or Korea have only one. Canada has one central buying office which is primarily for non-food products. Food is separated into East and West coast because customer behavior and taste profiles differ and there are many local suppliers. The US have eight regions as well as a national buying organization who buy for the entire country.

### Given Costco have less than 4,000 SKUs, does that change the organizational structure of procurement?

Quite a bit actually, because their model is based on their low cost of operations and includes the store, the staff and the buying organization. Buying less SKUs means you can dedicate more time to the details. A typical supermarket buyer manages 1,000 to 2,000 SKUs, whereas Costco buyers manage less than 200. Their buying team is also much smaller because they do not need 10 buyers for each category. Having one who buys 50 SKUs is more efficient.

### Did you have 50 to 100 SKUs within food?

We had GMM’s (General Merchandising Manager) in our structure which is the equivalent of a VP of merchandising. There was one for non-food and another for food, and within food was an assistant GMM or assistant VP responsible for two or three categories. One would take fresh, another frozen and another dry goods, and below that level there were different buyers. There was one buyer for frozen food, one for confectionery and one for fresh dairy products. A handful of buyers made the decisions for everything you see in a Costco. Below that are inventory control specialists who were responsible for clerical duties such as reordering, contract management and system maintenance.

### How would you compare the KPIs for a Costco buyer versus other retailers?

We had similar KPIs such as sales profitability and shrink inventory management, but the typical philosophy of Costco is managed mainly on sales which is king. If you had good sales and reached your target, profitability would come. Inventory manages itself if you have the basics right. Other retailers put profitability first, then sales, whereas Costco does the opposite.

### It seems other retailers optimize profitability and lean towards increasing prices, whereas Costco does the opposite by reducing the price and driving volume?

Yes, their philosophy is different. Costco are successful because they are always the cheapest in the market. The question every buyer asks is not how much profit they can make but how low can they go. Typical retailers maximize by bringing new SKUs and trying to extract more money from suppliers, raising the price as high as they can as long as customers still buy it. At Costco even if my price is the cheapest, if I get a cost decrease from a supplier, I will go even deeper than that. Customers buy tons of product at that price, so if I can go lower than that, I will.

Costco has a fixed margin requirement of 14% maximum INU or profit. Having said that, if I maximize at 14% and get a cost decrease from a supplier or negotiate a better price, instead of maximizing profit, I decrease the price. If I pay 10% less, my customer also pays 10% less. Costco maximizes both sale volume and customer value.

### How does that change the relationship with branded suppliers?

It changed in many ways. By now, all Costco suppliers know the operational model and what to expect. They know Costco want the best possible price and to move volume. The difference between a branded supplier selling to Costco versus Walmart, is that Costco includes everything in the price. In theory there is no marketing budget, trade marketing or listing fees. Costco has the best quality and price. It is mainly negotiated on other retailers who have listing fees, marketing and opening of new stores, and nothing is free in life. If you end up paying something on top, the customer has to pay for it.

### It must be a breath of fresh air to suppliers who know what Costco want and that they will be one of few brands in store, versus other retailers?

Costco is about cost efficiency and saving and their suppliers also need to do that. They benefit because selling to Costco is easy. Most of the time you have one key account manager with almost no team behind them because they can manage it on their own. When selling to other retailers, full time marketing and logistics staff are required due to the complexity. Reducing the complexity reduces the cost to a supplier who passes that saving to Costco who get a better price. It is a ripple effect; the simpler the business and the people managing it, the cheaper the cost. Both Costco and the supplier know that, whereas 20 years ago, the concept was difficult to explain.

### The rock bottom prices that suppliers give Costco equate to higher volumes and lower complexity, making the profitability of the account just as high as other retailers?

That is correct and companies love doing business with Costco, even though they are a tough negotiator and expect the best price in the market. Costco is always fair with suppliers. They try to extract the best from it, but still want to keep suppliers happy and profitable. Unhappy or unprofitable suppliers cut corners and people and, eventually, the business is no longer suitable. It needs to be a win-win but because of the simplicity and sheer volume, you no longer need to make 30% on a product. You can make 1% and sell 20 containers a week because you deposit money in the bank, not a percentage, so in the end you make it up on volume.

### Is there transparency such that Costco know the supplier's gross margin?

It depends on the relationship Costco has with the supplier. Like any business, it comes down to the people, the buyer versus the key account manager. Have they known each other for a long time or not so much? Costco buyers have been in the business for many years and know what the cost of products and shipping are. They have a fairly good idea of the product cost and profitability. A supplier who approaches Costco not knowing that might get a door in the nose if they do not put their best foot forward. I worked with buyers who know more about a product than the seller did because they have been doing the same thing, exporting and importing for 10, 15 or 20 years and have built everything from the ground up. Another advantage is that Costco pay their employees very well and generally keep their people happy.

### Why is the employee turnover at Costco so low?

They treat their people well and salaries are above the market average. The complexity of the business is so low making it easier to navigate through the business. It is never an easy job and there is a lot of pressure but there is less guess work when you know the dynamic. Costco management always support their employees. Their code of ethics state, obey the law, respect your employees and take care of your customer. When you do everything right your salary is the reward, but taking care of employees is always a top priority at Costco.

### Walk me through the typical procurement process, using confectionery from a branded supplier like Cadbury as an example. How does the selection process work?

A confectionery buyer is assigned a budget, space and an SKU count. Confectionery has two aisles which equate to 50 pallets which will contain chocolate, candy bars, salty snacks, energy bars, confectionery and nuts. The buyer needs to structure their space allocation and ensure they maximize it and budget accordingly because what is good one year is not necessarily good the following year. We all know the trends of less sugar and healthier options. Two years ago, many chocolate bars and candy bars were sold but now that market is going down. Instead, plant-based vegan snacks are in. Out of the 50 pallets, 20 pallets which were chocolate are now suddenly reduced to 10 and more space given to vegan snacks or plant-based confectionery. In that case, the buyer would identify what is needed in the assortment to maximize that.

They will define, on a granular level, the split between energy bar and salty snacks and within those, what are the opportunities. Some categories are stable and you will always have Nestlé and Cadbury; you cannot avoid that. When reducing the assortment in these categories, you need to search the market for the next big brands. A typical Costco buyer does not have to search far because there are more products offered than the demand. During the year, you could have 50 people knocking on your door trying to sell you healthy snacks. When they review, they will have plenty options to choose from and will pick the best option for that specific space in the store to maximize profits.

### Is that done on an annual basis?

It depends on the categories. Sometimes it is seasonal or once a year and other times there are no specific reviews but instead opportunities arise. They could decide to reduce two pallets and introduce healthier snacks. For seasonal BBQs and Christmas trees, they review a year in advance whereas, for confectionery, Christmas chocolate and Halloween come into play. It also depends on business and sales performance. If a buyer sees their category is down on sales and profit, they will look for the root cause and if it is a particular brand or different categories, they will make some changes.

### Do buyers have a target mix between Kirkland and branded products?

Not really but, in principle, a buyer always pushes private label if it makes sense. They are slightly more profitable and it is good for the image. The more assortment Kirkland has, the more brand recognition the company has with the Kirkland Signature. There is a tacit understood target, but not necessarily a fixed one.

### Do buyers receive a bonus based on sales per square foot or profitability?

Bonuses for buyers are split between sales and profitability. Several targets need to be achieved to receive the bonus and it used to be linked to company performance. If the company did not perform, you might not get a full bonus, but if they performed and you contributed to that you would also receive a bonus.

### Back to the selection process, if you decide 25% of the space is health bars, how do you choose the number of branded suppliers and which suppliers are best?

It is simply related to your budget per square meter of pallet space. If you know that, in your category, you need to generate $5,000 per pallet per store to make your budget, you make your product selection accordingly. You will probably not choose a brand which does not drive volume because you cannot afford it. Instead, you evaluate the brand or product potential on your 25% assortment. If you have four pallets of space and there are 10 different brands out there, you try to analyze based on product market share and performance. You would also see how much support they were willing to offer in terms of trade marketing or media campaigns; if there is a potential of a brand driving sales you will choose them. The rest is negotiation about prices and profitability but the selection process always come down to sales potential first.

### Does a vendor have a say in the SKU or size of the packaging or product?

No; a Costco buyer dictates what he wants and the supplier agrees or not. The dynamic between a small regional supplier and a Cadbury or Nestlé is very different. Cadbury will launch a new product and choose the format for the club channel, you take it or leave it, so it depends on the balance of power between Costco and the company. When a small guy sells to Costco, they tell them they need 1.2 kg, this is what my bags look like and this is the presentation I want; do you want it or not?

### How can brands increase their chance of getting selected by Costco?

Any brand has to prove they can meet the sales target. That could be from their price positioning, brand recognition or market share, but they need to prove they have 16% or 18% and what the potential is over the following months. It always helps to have a plan and say what your brand expectations are in the market because Costco do not market. They promote slightly but never push brands, so the brand needs to push itself. With an unknown brand, the chance that people pick it up on the shelf is very low, but if a brand runs a media campaign on TV in September and spends $2 million on marketing, it gives buyers an indication that they are willing to stand behind their brands and push the market. They want to create both push and pull marketing.

### Would a buyer want to know the sales figures for a specific SKU or product and the media and advertising budget behind it for the following year?

Yes and no; what counts more is sales. If Cadbury or Nestlé put a product on the shelf which is on TV, it will sell by itself. If something is really cool and trendy, like a new plant-based peanut butter, people will try it regardless of the brand. It always helps if a company shows they will invest extra money to ensure they become even more known in the market. Typically, brands do not invest much in Costco. There are several promotions they can do such as end cap display and degustation in the store; that is currently not possible but will be again, in the future. Everything they can do to promote their brands and push the sales will be an element of the decision making.

### Management often refer to the experience of shopping at Costco as a treasure hunt. Historically 20% to 25% of buying was opportunistic; how do these opportunistic deals come about from branded suppliers?

It is a combination between the buyer's work and the suppliers in general. Basic categories like toilet paper have no opportunities for treasure hunts or ‘in and outs’. Costco succeed when the customer is excited and the treasure hunt results in people making more trips to Costco. If you always have the same assortment, people will not walk the aisles; they will buy their toilet paper and water and leave. The buying organization has to keep providing exciting in and outs or treasure hunt opportunities and how you put that in your assortment depends how creative the buyer is. They need to have an eye for new opportunities from suppliers. There is also team work between the supplier community and the buying team. The best channel to provide that used to be trade shows but the pandemic has made that more difficult. Visiting trade shows gives you a flavor of new innovations and experienced buyers can see what would work in their assortment because it is not yet in the market or it could be something quick.

The strategy behind in and outs is that even though it is exciting and good, you cannot keep it longer because Costco created an urgency to buy. One day you see something cool but when you return it is no longer there and you lost your opportunity.

### One week they could have a hand bag on sale but the following week it is replaced with Levi jeans, so it creates an urgency to purchase the product.

Exactly, customers get caught a few times when they see something exciting, they plan to buy it the next time but lose the opportunity and get mad. The next time they go to Costco and see something really cool, they buy it immediately because they do not want to take a chance.

### Is it mainly from a brand’s overstock or do they ever ask you to run a test?

It is a combination of everything. The in and out opportunity could be end of line production or an amazing deal because they want to get rid of it and Costco is a good channel. It could be something cool the buyer saw at a trade show and only buys 50 pallets. It could be a novelty or an innovation that a supplier wants to test in the market. They are unsure whether it will work and use Costco to see if the product has legs or not. Many times, the in and out becomes a full-time opportunity because it is so fast that buyers want to repeat that. The next time they buy better, cheaper and larger quantities which makes this more permanent. The idea behind an in and out is to create excitement and urgency behind our categories.

### How would the pricing for in and outs work?

This is always a conversation between the buyer and supplier. Buyers know their market and suppliers know their cost structure so there will always be a discussion. Buyers dictate the price strategy and suppliers say yes or no; that is the end of the negotiation.

### What is the typical duration of a branded supplier contract at Costco?

There are no contracts other than sales performance. You need to generate a certain amount of sales per week per store. Failure to meet that threshold will result in you being replaced within a few months. You cannot bring in a product for a year and see what happens. The only exception is imported and seasonal products where buyers need to commit to import a product six months to a year before the season. If you bring 10,000 BBQs, you hope they sell, otherwise you are in trouble. In that case, it is more like a purchase commitment where you say, for that price, I will buy 100 containers spread over six months. Here is my container plan and POs.

If it does not sell, the buyer is in trouble. The opposite can also happen where it sells so fast that you end up without enough stock. As a buyer rule, you are never right, especially for seasonal. Either you have too many or not enough, and even if you have the right quantity, you will be told you could have sold more. Commitments are based on sales expectations.

### Do Costco buyers commit to any inventory beyond a month?

For local products there is not much commitment. There is always a minimum quantity because if you want to fill a Costco you need at least two pallets. As soon as it starts selling it no longer looks good on the floor and needs to be replenished. The expectation is if you bring a product, you need at least two pallets per product per store the buyer decides to list, because the buyer could list in only 10 stores instead of 100. You could do a small test to see how it sells in 10 stores and if it sells better, it could be expanded nationally or regionally. When you do Kirkland Signature or import brands from China or Christmas trees, it is produced six months in advance, meaning you have to buy everything that was produced.

### Do branded suppliers have to meet a certain revenue per SKU per store?

Yes. The buyer has a sales expectation of at least $3,000 per pallet per store. If that is not achieved something is done. Either a surprise or a promotion or replacement. Typically, the supplier and buyer verbally agree on the expectation and if it does not happen there will be a different conversation.

### What does a supplier typically do if they miss the sales target?

Due to the system and volume at Costco you know within a week if the target will be met. Buyers have limited SKUs and can look at the sales of each product every day. As a buyer, as soon as a new product hit the floor, I would know on the first day if it would be a hit. If within the week the product did not sell as expected, you will have a serious conversation. Nobody wins at keeping that product for an extra three weeks; it will never pick up.

In that case, the supplier has to do something about it. Perhaps the price is wrong. It might simply not be the right brand or product for a Costco customer. I always tried to manage an exit strategy before the product hits the floor. If it doesn't reach target, plan B is to reduce the price by 20%, plan C is we return or discount everything and then we are done with it. Sometimes the discussion happens slightly before the product hit. Other times you are surprised and need to discuss something more substantial. In many cases, suppliers stand behind you because they want another shot at it later. It also happens that suppliers are too small to support Costco and will not have other chances.

### Do suppliers reduce prices to maintain their relationship with Costco?

They could, or simply take back the product and find another channel for it. Costco could also drop the price by 50% to ensure they get rid of it. You can de-list the product and sell it out, but sometimes that is more damaging for brands who manage other customers. They have a fixed price in the market and suddenly Costco is 50% cheaper than elsewhere. That is bad for their brand image and in that case, they would rather take the hit and protect their brand and price strategy. Most suppliers choose to keep the relationship and have discussions later.

### What drives the price negotiation with brands who have other channels?

It depends on the brands and the balance of power. Big FMCG guys like P&G and Nestlé have channel management and price strategies and treat the club channel separately. They position their prices accordingly and explain to other retailers that clubs will always be cheaper because they do not ask for listing allowance fees. Their job as key account managers is to manage all accounts, but they have a typical channel for this. In some cases, that does not exist and it becomes an internal discussion with suppliers as to how to manage the deal. Costco always expect the best price in the market because of the volumes they do and the simplicity of the business. Suppliers who cannot agree to that do not sell to Costco.

### Is it transparent in a way where suppliers reveal their traditional and club prices and Costco is slightly lower due to the volume you get from being in our stores?

Correct. The big guys have one price per channel, which means Costco competes with Sam's Club and other wholesalers in the club channel who buy at the same price. The negotiation between supplier and buyer depends on the support they put behind their brands. A good strategy is to have a special club pack. The 12 pack in retail becomes a 30 pack in Costco. It is difficult for customers to compare prices per unit, but you can justify to supermarkets that if they want a Costco price, they need to stock a Costco pack, which is not their market. Over time suppliers get more sophisticated at how they manage their product and pricing strategy at Costco.

### That was a trick for traditional retailers for the suppliers to argue why clubs have a structurally lower price because they buy more volume and save on complexity.

Exactly.

### Does Costco have a structured price advantage over the other clubs?

Yes; in several stores, Sam's Club have more than Costco but in the volume per store Costco is way ahead of the game.

### So it’s scale per SKU that matters?

Per SKU exactly, but it depends on suppliers and who they want to play ball with. They might decide to only use Costco and forget about the others. They could also choose Sam's Club and not do Costco, or they may do both but manage the discussion between both sides. Costco always wants to be cheaper than Sam's Club, who want to be cheaper than Costco. That is the reality in the market and the dynamic of being a buyer and seller, but the advantage comes with sheer volume. You can offer the same base price to Sam's Club, Costco and any competitors. This is the price for a club pack and on top of that price there is a volume rebate. That means if you buy one container it is one price and if you buy 1,000 containers it is another price. That way a supplier can justify the price difference to another club. That system is fair because if you achieve the volume you are entitled to receive the best price.

### The revenue per SKU per store is $30-40,000. Does that increase Costco's bargaining power against bigger FMCG players?

Of course, the simplicity and the revenue per SKU generated with one sales guy and one assortment is valuable to any supplier. One product in Costco is equivalent to 20 products in 20 supermarkets, so they will do everything possible to gain that Costco business. The more volume Costco does, the more they increase their buying and negotiation power. When times are tough, if suppliers do not help Costco, they could damage their relationship, and the longer that relationship, the more they have to lose. If a supplier is going to lose money, they will do it because they know they could lose much more down the road.

### Do you have examples of big FMCG companies wanting to keep their Costco business during challenging times?

Yes, there are many cases where companies invest in a special pack or product which fails. That is part of the game and big companies budget for it. There is a potential for failure and some companies are creative. They take the financial loss, take everything back and open up all the big packs and make smaller packs for retail. Sometimes there is a split contribution where Costco keep half the product or reduce the price but come month end they take what is leftover. Costco also want to keep the relationship and will make the effort to keep it alive. Costco are not in the business of killing suppliers or stopping relationships. They build relationships and add benefit.

### Costco turn inventory over 12 times a year; how do buyers ensure they optimize replenishment and inventory turn?

That is why sales is so important, not only financially but for inventory turn. Keep in mind that a typical Costco store is actually a warehouse where you stock your merchandise. If you do not manage your inventory well, you end up with product which do not sell but occupy precious shelf space meaning you have no room to bring something which does sell. That is why the number of SKUs we do is critical. When managing 5,000 SKUs, it is much easier to manage inventory and have space for everything, assuming you have the volume behind it.

Inventory control specialists have a target to inventory turnover and look at the inventory report, stock level and replenishment required on a daily basis. Costco have a very efficient system where you can see the sales of every product, almost to the hour, per store. This makes it easy to notice bottle necks. This allows you to be surgical and remove specific SKUs from the two stores which have an inventory problem. You need to pay attention to inventory because it is crucial for the operation cost and to ensure you have enough space for more products.

### In 2008 or 2009, how did Costco react to maintain turns and ensure sales?

During the crisis it was easy. I was there in 2008, 2009 and Costco was the winner. The financial crisis caused many people to search for better deals and lower prices, which is exactly what Costco offer, so they ended up getting more business and achieving higher growth.

### Sales grew by 13% from 2007 to 2008, but fell 2% in 2009. They were still doing over a billion in net income all through 2008, 2009, and grew in 2010.

13% for such a big business is huge. Small businesses go 50% but their base is small. Costco is gigantic and a 2% or 1% growth is celebrated. Achieving 13% proves that people are diverting from typical retail to dollar stores and Costco because they offer price, quality and value. I left in 2010 but I think the private label helped because that is even better value for customers.

### How did suppliers react to the club channel in 2008, 2009?

Not that different from my personal experience. They saw other businesses going down and tried to divert as much business as possible. They put more effort on trying to win, even if they were not in Costco, as they were better off because the other channels were going down.

### Would suppliers give you better pricing and Costco grab more traffic because they are known for giving better deals in a crisis?

Exactly.

### How does the brand relationship work with private label or manufacturing suppliers of Kirkland?

If they had a choice, they would not do it, but I will put that into perspective. Nestlé sell a ton of water at Costco but one day Costco decide to offer private label water. They approach Nestlé and other suppliers but Nestlé refuse because they only do their own brands. Costco still does their private label water and Nestlé lose 20% of their revenue on volume. Nestlé have to make a strategic decision of sticking to their belief of not doing private label and losing 20% to 30% of their volume, or doing private label for Costco, and losing slightly on their brand. There is a love-hate relationship between brands and buyers. Suppliers have the capacity but face a big risk if they do not comply.

### Is it typically the same manufacturing line and plant of the Nestlé brand?

I do not know about Nestlé specifically but typically the people doing private label for Costco would be the suppliers of brands and other brands. Customers do not know which brand it is, but typically it is the market leader brand or something very big.

### But just has a Kirkland badge on it.

For some product categories it will be the exact line as the current brand; they simply change the label and call it Kirkland in two hours.

### Does it have the same taste and chemical structure?

It depends; water comes from a source and you put it in the same bottle, you simply change the label. I do not think Coca-Cola would do that but if they did, they might have a slightly different recipe. Costco also dictate what they want, especially for food. They design the recipe the way they like it and the way they think customers will like it. So even though it comes from the same factory or line, it might use different ingredients or an altered recipe.

### Suppliers are in a tricky position where they can lose 20% of their volume which deleverages their manufacturing facility, or they could increase volume, reduce unit costs and end up more profitable than their branded products elsewhere?

Exactly. So it becomes a strategic decision for suppliers to do it.

### Why would a supplier not do it?

Some take the decision not to do it for different reasons. Some refuse because they are all about their brand, which is fair enough and should be respected. Sometimes they do not have the capacity for more volume and do not want to penalize other buyers of their brands. It sometimes also comes down to specification. Costco could decide to have their private label with a specification which they cannot meet. They might decide not to invest in new machinery to build Costco brands and keep it the way it is. There are different reasons why suppliers do not do it but it is not always a good financial decision to do it. If they believe in and push their brands, this might decrease their brand equity in the market down the road and make it difficult to put all their energy into their brands and promote them. It is a financial and long-term strategic decision.

### Does it give suppliers more bargaining power with their branded products? Could Cadbury offer to do private label chocolates for Costco if you verbally guarantee their product will be in the category?

Yes and no. In theory, it is a negotiation argument. For typical retailers that will work but Costco is an item buying organization, not a category, and could decide it does not fit. For example, you might be very good at producing private label and I will buy from you because you have the best machinery and cost structure, that is exactly what I want but your brand is number two, but Costco require number one in order to generate sales per square meter per pallet. From that perspective, a Costco buyer would never agree to buy your brands if you do my private label. The item needs to sustain itself.

### So it always come back to sales per pallet?

Exactly, going back to sales.

### How does the relationship differ between regional or non-branded private label suppliers versus branded suppliers?

It does not differ because it comes down to supplying the best product at the best price and if we meet the sales target, everybody is happy. It differs slightly with big brands who are more strategic because Costco have the volume and the customers and know the market, but brands sometimes have additional information from focus groups and market studies and so we can help each other in that regard. P&G and Nestlé have internal category teams who ask Costco for help, which is an added value for Costco who lack the market intelligence and data behind it. There is a benefit of keeping that relationship with the big guys because, in exchange, they provide information which helps me manage entire categories, not just their product.

### It reminds me of Aldi and Lidl who offer fewer SKUs develop closer relationships with private label suppliers to reduce cost. How deep are the relationships with private label suppliers of Kirkland to ensure optimization?

Buyers are experienced and some of them are very creative. There is no shame in sharing best practices from both the supplier and buyer side. For example, by changing the shape of a product from round to square, we can fit 50 more products per pallet, multiplied by 1,000 trucks and six months, you can reduce the price by 10% by simply changing the packaging. The supplier could also have new technology where if you put that specification into the product, they can save money down the road which they pass onto us.

There is a perpetual conversation around product development and specification of private labels to allow us to sell more while reducing the cost. You can be the king this year selling your product, even private label, but if you do not take care of it, it will fade and someone else will take over with a better price on the market. Continual product development keeps you on your toes.

### Do you need to have exclusive suppliers for private label items?

No, but with Costco's volume, it typically takes up the entire production. There is neither room nor need for suppliers to get more private label on their line.

### I recently bought a cheap Kirkland golf glove. Would you typically take the whole volume from private label suppliers and would they be transparent about their pricing and cost structure to ensure you are working together?

One main difference is that Costco dictates the specification. An example would be, what is the gauge and tensile strength for a garbage bag. This makes it difficult for the factory to replicate to other customers because they have different needs with different price levels. However, if the specification already exists and they sell to somebody else, they put themselves at risk because even though Costco customers and buyers compare the price in the market, they are still the cheapest on a Cadbury product. They do the same with private labels, so it means for the Kirkland Signature golf glove, they will look at other golf gloves in the market and if they find one with the same quality but cheaper, something is wrong. It could be the same factory or a better factory but next time they will have a conversation with the supplier. Either they offer a better price because Costco is no longer competitive, or Costco simply goes to the other factory.

### Are there no strict contractual agreements with private label suppliers preventing them from supplying the same specification to others?

That could happen but it is unnecessary, because again it comes down to sales. If you are competitive and have the best product and price in the market, you achieved your goal.

### Is there a typical open cost pricing structure where you would know that a private label supplier is earning a margin to ensure the ecosystem is profitable?

Yes, it is an open relationship. There is no point in Costco pushing everything possible resulting in the factory cutting corners, especially in foreign countries where you have no control. There is also no point in the factory hiding because Costco buyers eventually find out. There is transparency about the cost of raw materials and production per hour per employee. This is how much the machine run costs, down to the bottle cap which is 0.5 cents. We will structure it to ensure the manufacturer has some profit while still keeping Costco competitive. There is no benefit for Costco or a manufacturer to operate at or below cost because it is unsustainable. If they are too greedy Costco will find out they are no longer the cheapest and go elsewhere next year.

### Did you roll out any Kirkland products in your categories during your time?

Yes, several times.

### Confectionery brands?

I did some confectionery as well as cleaning and household products.

### How do you decide which category or SKU to launch Kirkland in?

It is a process decision and there are two reasons to do private label own brands. First is providing an alternative to my customers with the same quality or better at a cheaper price. The second is profitability. In the FMCG category, you compete daily with big supermarkets and retailers so sometimes your margin is not optimized. Even though you can go up to 14% you might end up doing only 6% because you are competitive and want to be cheapest in the market.

The supplier cannot cut the price further otherwise they will disrupt their market, so you end up with a high selling product with huge volumes but only 6% margin. If you bring your own brand and they take 20% or 30% of the volume, you can then make 14%. For the overall profitability it makes more sense because 30% more volume doubles the margin. If there is no value to customers or you’re are not more profitable, it is better to keep the brand or introduce an equivalent.

### Kirkland private label products make sense even when there is a strong category leader because it gives you a chance to increase the category gross margin?

Correct, but margin is not the main driver; sales and customer value are. It depends on the category because some are brand sensitive, like dog food or diapers. People trust Pampers and Huggies but are hesitant with private labels when it involves their baby or dog. In other categories like Christmas trees, there are no brands so you can might as well call it Kirkland. If there are no recognized brands in the market and you call it Kirkland it helps all the other categories of Kirkland Signature. This is the strength of the Kirkland Signature brand compared to many other retailer's private labels. Costco is alone in having a single brand and nothing else, whereas the Metro Group in Europe have brands for coffee.

### I have never understood that.

It is probably driven by marketing instead of business. The advantage of having one brand is you can focus much more. Having a single strategy and message is easier to manage. Kirkland Signature is all about value, quality and customer experience. If I buy a Kirkland Signature garbage bag and am impressed with the quality and paid 20% less, I will keep buying it, but the next time I buy cashews at Costco, I will choose Kirkland Signature which are the cheapest. The next time I see dog food, even though I am nervous of choosing something other than brand one, Costco impressed me with garbage bags, cleaning, meat and salmon, it must be good for my dog.

Over time, having one brand is a winning strategy because it is easy to manage and promote the brand without marketing Kirkland Signature, whereas other brands you need to spend a lot of money on private labels, yet 1% to 2% of people recognize or remember your brand. Kirkland Signature is known because of the customer experience and the more product they have on the shelf, the more people recognize that and the more it promotes itself.

### Does management limit the gross margin of Kirkland Signature to 14%?

Slightly higher but there is also a cap.

### What makes Kirkland unique from other retailers who roll out private label?

In addition to quality, price and experience, Kirkland has specification definitions and is bench-marked against market leading brands. For detergent we would use Procter and Gamble's Tide who is the market leader, and make Kirkland Signature the same spec or better. You will never find a Kirkland Signature product lower in specification than typical local brands because it makes no sense. People recognize it is the best product cheaper than the leading brand, and have a good customer experience on top of that.

### You are almost asking the brand to manufacture Kirkland to be as good as theirs but cheaper and this is all because of the volume and scale of the Costco model?

Yes, but it depends on the categories and suppliers. P&G do not produce any private label for Costco but there are many private label manufacturers who can replicate P&G. They use the same machine, ingredients and recipe pretty much, and can reverse engineer or even make it better. What makes P&G more expensive in the market is the marketing behind it. P&G are a marketing company, not a producer. Some companies outsource to other manufacturers. It comes down to the brand decision. Do they cut their margin by 20% and make Kirkland Signature, or stick behind their story and say this is not their philosophy and they will not support it?

### The higher price from P&G has to cover the R&D and marketing expenses?

Exactly.

### If you produce a detergent as good as P&G with a private label supplier, there is some product development expense; who pays for that?

Typically for big volume items, both brands and private label manufacturers have R&D specialists working for them because they develop private labels for other people as well. They know about mixing recipes, specifications, ingredients and raw materials. They can easily reverse engineer any product in the market. They will say, we can do it; this is what is involved, this is the cost and this is what I need to buy. Typically, the manufacturer supplier would pay for it.
