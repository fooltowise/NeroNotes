## Keys to our Success
1. It is occasionally possible for a tortoise, content to assimilate insights of his best predecessors, to outrun hares that seek originality or don't wish to be left out of some crowd folly that ignores the best work of the past. This happens as the tortoise stumbles on some particularly effective way to apply the best previous work, or simply avoids standard calamities. We try more to profit from always remembering the obvious that from grasping the esoteric. **It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.**
2. We don't claim to have perfect morals, but at least we have a huge area of things that, while legal, are beneath us. We won't do them. Currently, there's a culture in America that says that anything that won't send you in prison is okay. We believe there should be a huge area between everything you should do and everything you can do without getting into legal trouble. I don't think you should come anywhere near that line. We don't deserve much credit for this. It helps to make more money. I'd like to believe that we'd behave well even if it didn't work. But more often, we've made extra money from doing the right thing.
3. Remember Louis Vincenti's rule: tell the truth, and you won't have to remember your lies. It's such a simple concept.

## Comments on Berkshire Hathaway
### Berkshire is a hell of a business
We're like the hedgehog that only knows one big thing: if you can generate float (cash from insurance premiums that Berkshire can invest before claims must be paid) at three percent and invest it in businesses that generate thirteen percent, that's a pretty good business.

The businesses that Berkshire has acquired will return thirteen percent pretax on what we paid for them, maybe more. With a cost of capital of three percent - generated via other people's money in the form of float - that's a hell of a business. That's the reason Berkshire shareholders needn't totally despair. Berkshire is not as good as it was in terms of percentage compounding (going forward), but it's still a hell of a business.

I hate to be an optimist, but we have really added a lot of wonderful businesses to Berkshire over the past few years.

### Berkshire's past returns
Berkshire's past record has been almost ridiculous. If Berkshire had used even half the leverage of, say, Rupert Murdoch, it would be five times its current size.

### Berkshire's future outlook
One of the smartest things a person can do is dampen investment expectations, especially with Berkshire. That would be mature and responsible. I like our model, and we should do nicely.
The future will be harder for Berkshire Hathaway for two reasons:
1. We're so big. It limits our investment options to more competitive areas that are examined by very smart people like Alice Schroeder (the insurance analyst from Paine Webber and then Morgan Stanley, who was sitting in the audience).
2. The current climate offers prospects in common stocks over the next fifteen to twenty years that are way less than we've experience over the past fifteen to twenty years. Read Warren's *Fortune* article - I totally agree with it ("Mr Buffett on the stock market, 11/22/99")

Berkshire Hathaway's value will be higher in twenty years, but it is certain that the annual rate of percentage growth will be much lower. But this is not a tragedy. We're content. Berkshire Hathaway and Wesco will accumulate cash every year, and we have a structure that gives us enormous flexibility. While we're too big to buy the stock of a small company, we have the advantage of having entire companies offered to us. Something has always turned up for us. I'm not discouraged, but I don't think your money here is going to do anything like what you're use to.

It's a finite and very competitive world. All large aggregations of capital eventually find it hell on earth to grow and thus find a lower rate of return.

Personally, I think Berkshire will be a lot bigger and stronger than it is. Whether the stock will be a good investment from today's price is another question. The one thing we've always guaranteed is that the future will be a lot worse than the past. The future returns of Berkshire and Wesco won't be as good in the future as they have been in the past. This is true of all large, successful companies. The only difference is that we'll tell you.

### Berkshire Hathaway's culture
Our culture is very old-fashioned, like Ben Franklin's or Andrew Carnegie's. Can you imagine Carnegie hiring consultants? It's amazing how well this approach still works. A lot of the businesses we buy are kind of cranky and old-fashioned like us.
For many of our shareholders, our stock is all they own, and we're acutely aware of that. Our culture of conservatism runs very deep.
This is an amazingly sound place. We are more disaster-resistant than most other places. We haven't pushed it as hard as other people would have pushed it.
I'm happy having ninety percent of my net worth in Berkshire stock. We're going to try to compound it at a reasonable rate without taking unreasonable risk or using leverage. If we can't do this, then that's just too damn bad.

### Berkshire and Wesco's stock prices
We like the stocks of both Berkshire and Wesco to trade within hailing distance of what we think  of as intrinsic value. When it runs up, we try to talk it down. That's not all common in Corporate America, but that's the way we act.
Today, it seems to be regarded as the duty of CEOs to make the stock go up. This leads to all sorts of foolish behavior. We want to tell it like it is.


I don't want to go back to Go. I've been to Go. A lot of our shareholders have a majority of their net worth in Berkshire, and they don't want to go back to Go either. 

### Berkshire shareholders
We like our current shareholders and don't want to entice anyone to become one. I think our reporting, considering the complexity of the enterprise, is better that of any enterprise I know at giving shareholders the information they need. We do it conscientiously.

### Berkshire's acquisition strategy
Two thirds of acquisitions don't work. Ours work because we don't try to do acquisitions - we wait for no-brainers.

### Competition for acquisitions
We've had private equity competitors for a long time, but one way or another, we've manager to buy quite a few things.
The general assumption is that it must be easy to sit behind a desk and people will bring in one good opportunity after another - this was the attitude in venture capital a few years ago. This was not the case at all for us - we scrounged around for companies to buy. For twenty years, we didn't buy more than one or two per year.
It's fair to say that we were rooting around. There were no commissioned salesmen. Anytime you sit there waiting for a deal to come by, you're in a very dangerous seat.

### Managers of acquired companies
We've bought business after business because we admire the founders and what they've done with their lives. In almost all cases, they've stayed on, and our expectations have not been disappointed.
What matters most: passion or competence that was inborn? Berkshire is full of people who have a peculiar passion for their own business. I would argue passion is more important than brain power.
I don't think our managers who come to this meeting are picking up new tricks - they know all the tricks related to their business - but this is an interesting place and it gets more interesting every year and they like being part of it.

### Managing subsidiaries
By and large, we've chosen people we admire enormously to have the power beneath us. It's easy for us to get along with them on average because we love and admire them. And they create the culture for whatever invention and reality recognition is going on in their business. And included in that reality recognition is the recognition that previous conclusions were incorrect.

There are certain virtues that are common in all of Berkshire's subsidiaries. We don't create them - we select companies that have them already. We just don't screw it up. We have decentralized power to a point just short of total abdication.

It would help current shareholders to hear our CEOs of the Berkshire subsidiaries, but we promised them they could spend one hundred percent of their time on their business. We place no impediments on them running their businesses. Many have expressed to me how happy they are that they don't have to spend twenty five percent of their time on activities they don't like.

### Synergies
The reason we avoid the word "synergy" is because generally people claim more synergistic benefits than will come. Yes, it exists, but there are so many false promises. Berkshire is full of synergies - we don't avoid synergies, just claims of synergies.

### Making the right personnel decisions
It's amazing how few times over the decades we've had to remove a person - far less than other companies. It's not that we're soft or foolish, it's that we're wiser and luckier. most people would look back and say their worst mistake was not firing someone soon enough. We don't say that. Our record is fabulous. We're old-fashioned. For example, in the case of CORT business services ( a furniture rental business that Wesco acquired), Warren said to me "You're going to love Paul Arnold(CORT's CEO)." And he was right. Paul's been running the business since he was in law school and he loves it.

### Berkshire's Insurance Operations
Reinsurance is not as much a commodity business as it might appear. There's such a huge time lag between when a policy is written and when it is paid that the customer has to evaluate the insurer's future willingness and ability to pay. We have a reputational advantage, though it's not as big as it should be.

I do think we get some advantage in reinsurance because people trust our willingness and ability to pay, so it's not a commodity. I think we have some special talents. That being said, I think it's dangerous to rely on special talents - it's better to own lots of monopolistic businesses with unregulated prices. But that's not the world today. We have made money exercising our talents and will continue to do so.

I'm glad we have insurance, though it's not a no-brainer, I'm warning you. We have to be smart to make it work.
The overall result is that we're going to do pretty well - meaning in the top ten percent of the industry - because we do different things and we're willing to do some unpleasant things.

Generally speaking, we're mildly optimistic about our insurance operations.

Growing float at a sizable rate a low cost is almost impossible - but we intend to do it anyway. I've been amazed by the growth and cost of our float. It's wonderful to generate billions of dollars of float at a cost way below Treasury notes.

Lumpy results and being willing to write less insurance business if market conditions are unfavorable... that is one of our advantages as an insurer - we don't give a damn about lumpy results. Every one else is trying to please Wall Street. This is not a small advantage. Nobody else does it, but to me not worrying about trying to please Wall Street is obviously the only way to go. A lot about Berkshire is like this. Being controlling owners is key - it would be hard for a committee to make these kinds of decisions.

### Berkshire Hathaway repurchasing shares

In the past, when Berkshire has gotten cheap, we've found other even cheaper stocks to buy. I'd always prefer this. It's no fun to have the company so lacking in repute that we can make money for some shareholders by buying out others.

### Splitting Berkshire stock to create more liquidity
I think the notion that liquidity of tradable common stock is a great contributor to capitalism is mostly twaddle. The liquidity gives us these crazy booms, so it has as many problems as virtues.
Berkshire trades at $50 million of stock per day, so very few people will have a problem selling it. But we're trying to create more people who have the problem of owning stock worth so much that liquidity is an issue.

### Why don't more companies and investors copy Berkshire Hathaway?
It's a good question. Our approach has worked for us. Look at the fun we, our managers, and our shareholders are having. More people should copy us. It's not difficult, but it looks difficult because it's unconventional -  it isn't the way things are normally done. We have low overhead, don't have quarterly goals or budgets or a standard personnel system, and our investing is much more concentrated than is the average. It's simple and common sense.

I was recently speaking with Jack McDonald, who teaches a course on investing rooted in our principles at Stanford Business School. He said it's lonely - like he's the Maytag repairman.

## Comments on Buffett
It's hard to believe that he's getting better with each passing year. It won't go on forever, but Warren is actually improving. It's remarkable: most seventy-two-year old men are not improving, but Warren is.

### Charlie's Influence on Warren
I think those authors give me more credit than I deserve. It is true that Warren had a touch of brain block from working with Ben Graham and making a ton of money - it's hard to switch from something that's worked so well. But if Charlie Munger had never lived, the Buffett record would still be pretty much what it is.

I think there's some mythology in this idea that I've been this great enlightener of Warren. He hasn't needed much enlightenment. But we know more now than five years ago.

### What happens when Buffett's gone?
The key is having good businesses. There's a lot of momentum here. However, I don't think our successors will be as good as Warren at capital allocation.

Berkshire is drowning in money - we have great businesses pounding out money. If the stock went down, Berkshire could buy it back. There's no reason to think it will go to hell in a bucket, and I think there's reason to believe it could go on quite well. I'd be horrified if it isn't bigger and better over time, even after Warren dies. When Warren is gone, the acquisition side of Berkshire will not do as well, but the rest will do well. And the acquisition side will do just fine. In any case, we've guaranteed you that the historical rate of growth will go down, and we wouldn't want to make a liar out of me.

I think the top guy won't be as smart as Warren. But it's silly to complain: "What kind of world is this that gives me Warren Buffett for forty years, and then some bastard comes along who's worse?"

If anyone would have a reason to worry, it would be me, but having known the Buffett family for decades, I say to you; "Don't worry about it. You should be so lucky."

### What if Charlie dies?
As you can tell, we're planning on immortality here. What do you need - sitting on a pile of money and Warren Buffett sitting at the parent corporation?

### Charlie as the abominable No-Man
Buffett: You just have to learn how to calibrate his answers. If you ask Charlie something and he says "no", then we put all of our money in it. If he says "that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard", then we make a moderate investment. If you calibrate his answers, you'll get a lot of wisdom.

## Investment Advice
### The importance of temperament, patience, and curiosity
One of the key elements to successful investing is having the right temperament - most people are too fretful; they worry too much. Success means being very patient, but aggressive when it's time. And the more hard lessons  you can learn vicariously rather than through your own hard experience, the better.

I think there's something to be said for developing the disposition to own stocks without fretting. But temperament alone won't do it. You need a lot of curiosity for a long, long time.

You need to have a passionate interest in why things are happening. That cast of mind, kept over long periods, gradually improves your ability to focus on reality. if you don't have that cast of mind, you're destined for failure even if you have a high IQ.

### Focus Investing
Our investment style has been given a name - focus investing - which implies ten holdings, not one hundred or four hundreds.

Our game is to recognize a big idea when it comes along, when one doesn't come along very often. Opportunity comes to the prepared mind. The idea that it is hard to find good investments, so concentrate on a few, seems to me to be an obviously good idea. But ninety-eight percent of the investment world doesn't think this way. It's been good for us - and you - that we've done this.

What's funny is that most big investment organizations don't think like this. They hire lots of people, evaluate Merck vs. Pfizer and every stock in the S&P500, and think they can beat the market. You can't do it.


We have this investment discipline of waiting for a fat pitch.
 If I was offered the chance to go into a business where people would measure me against benchmarks, force me to be fully invested, crawl around looking over my shoulders, etc., I would hate it. I would regard it as putting me into shackles.
 
 Very few people have adopted our approach. Focus investing is growing somewhat, but what's really growing is the unlimited use of consultants to advise on asset allocation, to analyze other consultants, and so forth. Maybe two percent of people will come into our corner of the tent, and the rest of the ninety-eight percent will believe what they've been told (e.g, that markets are totally efficient).
 
 ### Misteaching Investing
 Beta and modern portfolio theory and the like - none of it makes any sense to me. We're trying to buy businesses with sustainable competitive advantages at a low, or even a fair, price. 
 How can professors spread this nonsense that a stock's volatility is a measure of risk? I've been waiting for this craziness to end for decades. It's been dented, but it's still out there.
 
 Warren once said to me, "I'm probably misjudging academia generally in thinking so poorly of it because the people that interact with me have bonkers theories."
 
 ### Diversification
 The idea of excessive diversification is madness. We don't believe that widespread diversification will yield a good result. We believe almost all good investments  will involve relatively low diversification.
 
 If you took our top fifteen decisions out, we'd have a pretty average record. It wasn't hyperactivity, but a hell of a lot of patience. You stuck to your principles, and when opportunities came along, you pounced on them with vigor.
 
 Berkshire in its history has made money betting on sure things.
 
 ### Sit-on-your-ass investing
 If you buy something because it's undervalued, then you have to think about selling it when it approaches your calculation of its intrinsic value. That's hard. But if you buy a few great companies, then you can sit on your ass. That's a good thing.
 
 We're partial to putting out large amounts of money where we won't have to make another decision.
 
 ### What is a better business?
 
 There are two kinds of businesses: the first earns twelve percent, and you can take the profits at the end of the year. The second earns twelve percent, but all the excess cash must be reinvested - there's never any cash. It reminds me of the guy who sells construction equipment - he looks at his used machines, taken in as customers bought new ones, and says: "There's all of my profit, rusting in my yard." We hate that kind of business.
 
 ###  See's Candy: Case study of a better business
 
 > If See's Candy when we were buying it had asked for $100'000 more, Warren and I would have walked - that's how dumb we were.

Ira Marshall said you guys are crazy - there are some things you should pay up for, like quality businesses and people. You are underestimating quality. We listened to the criticism and changed our mind. This is a good lesson for anyone: the ability to take criticism constructively and learn from it. If you take the indirect lessons we learned from See's, you could say Berkshire was built on constructive criticism.

### Mistakes

The most extreme mistakes in Berkshire's history have been mistakes of omission. We saw it, but didn't act on it. They're huge mistakes - we've lost billions. And we keep doing it. We're getting better at it. We never get over it.

There are two types of mistakes: 
1. Doing nothing, what Warren calls "sucking my thumb".
2. Buying with an eyedropper things we should be buying a lot of.

After nearly making a terrible mistake not buying See's, we've made similar mistakes many times. We are apparently slow learners. These opportunity costs don't show up on financial statements but have cost us many billions.

Since mistakes of omission aren't visible, most people don't pay attention to them. We rub our noses in mistakes of omission - as we just did. (They had just discussed failing to buy Wall-mart stock because it moved up a bit, a $10 billion mistake).


### Buying into stock declines
Over many decades, our usual practice is that if the stock of something we like goes down, we buy more and more. Sometimes something happens, you realize you're wrong, and you get out. But if you develop correct confidence in your judgment, buy more and take advantage of stock prices.

Attractive investment opportunities tend to be ephemeral.

Really good investment opportunities aren't going to come along too often and won't last too long, so you've got to be ready to act. Have a prepared mind.


### Opportunities for small investors
If you have only a little capital and are young today, there are fewer opportunities than when I was young. Back then, we had just come out of a depression. Capitalism was a bad word. There had been abuses in the 1920s. A joke going around then was the guy who said "I bought stock for my old age and it worked - in six months, I feel like an old man!".

It's tougher for you, but that doesn't mean you won't do well - it just may take more time. But what the heck, you may live longer.
I'd work with very small stocks, searching for unusual mispriced opportunities, but it's such a small world.

### Short selling
Being short and seeing a promoter take the stock up is very irritating. It's not worth it to have that much irritation in your life.

### Learning process
I don't know anyone who learned to be a great investor with great rapidity. Warren has gotten to be one hell of a lot better investor over the period I've known him, as have I. So the game is to keep learning. You gotta like the learning process.

I've watched Warren for decades. Warren has learned a lot, which has allowed him to expand his circle of competence so he could invest in something like PetroChina.

If you're going to be an investor, you're going to make some investments where you don't have all the experience you need. Bug if you keep trying to get a little better over time, you'll start to make investments that are virtually certain to have a good outcome. The keys are discipline, hard work, and practice. It's like playing golf - you have to work on it.

If you don't keep learning, other people will pass you by.

### Circle of competence and its boundaries
There are a lot of things we pass on. We have three baskets: in, out, and too tough. We have to have a special insight, or we'll put it in the "too tough" basket. All you have to look for is a special area of competency and focus on that.

If you have competence, you know the edge. It wouln't be a competence if you didn't know where the boundaries lie. Asking whether you've passed the boundary is a question that almost answer itself.

### Cost of capital and opportunity cost
Buffett: Charlie and I don't know our cost of capital. It's taught at business schools, but we're skeptical. We just look to do the most intelligent thing we can with the capital that we have. We measure everything against our alternatives. I've never see a cost-of-capital calculation that made sense to me. Have you, Charlie?

Never. If you take the best text in economics by Mankiw, he says intelligent people make decisions based on opportunity costs - in other words, it's your alternatives that matter. That's how we make all of our decisions. The rest of the world has gone off on some kick - there's even a cost of equity capital. A perfectly amazing mental malfunction. Obviously, consideration of costs is key, including opportunity costs. Of course, capital isn't free. It's easy to figure out your cost of borrowing, but theorists went bonkers on the cost of equity capital. They say that if you're generating a one hundred percent return on capital, then you shouldn't invest in something that generates an eighty percent return on capital. That's crazy.

### Value of forecasts
People have always had this craving to have someone tell them the future. Long ago, kings would hire people to read sheep guts. There's always been a market for people who pretend to know the future. Listening to today's forecasters is just as crazy as when the king hired the guy to look at the sheep guts. It happens over and over and over.

### IPOs

It is entirely possible that you could use our mental models to find good IPOs to buy. There are countless IPOs every year, and I'm sure that there are a few cinches that you could jump on. But the average person is going to get creamed. So if you think you're talented, good luck. IPOs are too small for us, or too high tech - we don't understand them. So if Warren's looking at them, I don't know about it.


## Comments on the Market

### Stocks, Rembrandts, and Bubbles
Stocks are valued partly like bonds, based on a roughly rational projections of producing future cash. But they are also valued partly like Rembrandt paintings, purchased mostly because their price have gone up so far. This situation, combined with big "wealth effects", at first up and later down, can conceivably produce much mischief. 

[April 2020] It's the most extreme in modern capitalism. In the 1930s, we had the worst depression in 600 years. Today is almost as extreme in the opposite way... We use the phrase "wretched excess" because the consequences are wretched. 

Bonds are much more rational. No one thinks a bond's value will soar to the moon.

### Future market returns
[November 2000] If stocks compound at fifteen percent going forward, then it will be due to a big "Rembrandt effect". This is not good. Look at what happened in Japan, where stocks traded at fifty to sixty times earnings. This led to a ten-year depression. I think that was a special situation, though. My guess is that we won't get extreme "Rembrandtisation", and the returns thereafter will be six percent. If I'm wrong, it could be for a bad reason. If stocks trade more like Rembrandts in the future, then stocks will rise, but they will have no anchors. In this case, it's hard to predict how far, how high, and how long it will last.

[April 2001] I think generally that American investors should reduce their expectations. People aren't being a little stupid, but massively stupid. No one has an interest in saying this though.

[May 2001] We are not in a hog-heaven period. The investment game is getting more and more competitive. I don't know if we'll ever see stocks in general at the mouth-watering levels that we saw in 1973-1974 or even in 1982. I think there's a very excellent chance that neither Warren nor I will see those opportunities again, but that's not all bad. We'll just keep plugging away.

Buffett: It's not out of the realm of possibility though. You can never predict what markets will do. In Japan, a ten-year bond is yielding five-eights of one percent. Who could have ever imagined that? 
If that could happen in Japan, something much less bad could happen in the US. We could be in for a period in which the average fancy-paid investment advisor just won0t do very well.

The temporary collapse in junk bonds in late 2002, where they got to thirty-five to forty percent yields, was just a strange thing. There was absolute chaos at the bottom tick. Apply this behavior to stocks - it's not hard to imagine a big crunch coming along.

### Current outlook
[May 2004] In terms of the general climate, I think it's pretty miserable fir anyone who likes easy, sure money. Common stocks may be reasonably fairly valued, but they are not overwhelmingly bargains.

Our cash is speaking for itself. If we had a lot of wonderful ideas, we wouldn't have so much cash.

Berkshire and Wesco are full of cash that we don't know what to do with. Berkshire has $70 billion if you count the bonds, and Wesco is drowning in cash. It's the most extreme it's ever been. In the past, we've just been patient, and we were able to put it to work.

## Critique on Corporate Management
### Earnings Manipulation and Accounting Shenanigans
With so much money riding on reported numbers, human nature is to manipulate them. And with so many doing it, you get Serpico effects, where everyone rationalizes that it's okay because everyone else is doing it. It is always thus.

Now, it's chain letter mechanics. Because it's mixed with legitimate activities like venture capital, it looks respectable. But we're mixing respectable activity with disrespectable activity - hence my comment at the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting about if you mix raisins with turds, you still get turds. There is nothing in accounting that can prevent unscrupulous managers from engaging in a chain-letter type fraud.

### Spotting crooked management
Bernie Ebbers and Ken Lay were caricatures - they were easy to spot. They were almost psychopaths. But it's much harder to spot problems at companies like Royal Dutch (Shell).

But we don't learn because I'd still expect that Exxon's figures are fair. 
I want to make an apology. Last night, referring to some of our modern tycoons I said that when they're talking, they're lying and when they're quiet, they're stealing. This wasn't my witticism; it was used long ago to describe the robber barons.

### Corporate America's addiction to extraordinary charges
If it happens every year like clockwork, what's so extraordinary about it?

### Corporate governance
The cause of reform is hurt not helped when an activist makes an idiotic suggestion like saying that having Warren on the board of Coke us contrary to the interests of Coke. Nutty behavior undermines the cause.

## Critique of the Money Management business

### Flawed incentives
The general system of money management today require people to pretend to do something they can't do and like something they don't. It's a terrible way to spend your like, but it's very well paid.

### No value added
Mutual funds charge two percent per year and then brokers switch people between funds, costing another three to four percentage points. The poor guy in the general public is getting a terrible product from the professionals. I think it's disgusting. It's much better to be part of a system that delivers value to the people who buy the product. But if it makes money, we tend to do it in this country.

It's a funny business because on a net basis, the whole investment management business together gives no value added to all buyers combined. That's the way it has to work.

### Stockbrokers vs Index Funds
It's hard to sit here at this annual meeting, surrounded by smart, honorable stockbrokers who do well for their clients, and criticize them. But stockbrokers, in toto, will do so poorly that the index fund will do better.

I think indexing is a wiser choice for the average foundation than what it is now doing in unleveraged equity investment - and particularly so at is present total croupier costs, exceed one percent of principal per annum. Indexing can't work well forever if everybody turns to it. But it will work all right for a long term.

### The mutual fund scandal
The business of selecting investment managers was recently shown to be even harder by the revelation that a significant fraction of mutual fund managers took a bribe to betray their own shareholders. 
It was as if a man came up and said "Why don't we kill your mother, and we'll split the insurance money?" And many people said "Why, yes, I'd like some of that insurance money."

And many of them think what happened to them was unjust. 
If mutual fund directors are independent, I'm the lead character in the Bolshoi ballet.

## Critique of Wall Street
### Wall Street's lack of ethics
The ethics of Wall Street will always average out to mediocre at best. This doesn't mean there aren't some wonderful, intelligent people on Wall Street - there are, like those in this room - but everyone I know has to fight his own firm to do the right thing.
The general culture of investment banking has deteriorated over the years. We did a $6 million deal years ago for Diversified Retailing, and we were rigorously and intelligently screened. The bankers cared and wanted to protect their clients.
The culture now is that anything that can be sold for a profit will be. "Can you sell it?" is the moral test, and that's not an adequate test.


### Salomon Case Study
It's amazing what goes on. Salomon was at least as disciplined and rational as other investment banks but by the end, Salomon was begging for investment business from Robert Maxwell, whose nickname was "The bouncing Czech". You'd think if this was his nickname, investment banks wouldn't be chasing his business.

Buffett: The day they found him bobbing (in the water; he committed suicide as the scandal about his misdeeds broke), we (Salomon) sent money to him in exchange for money he was sending to us, but he didn't pay. So, we went to England to collect from his sons, and it was a mess.

An investment banker's earnings would be increased in a significant way if he wrote a few more tickets to Maxwell. You have to control this if guys can make money by bringing dubious things in the door.


### Normandy America Case study

Warren and Charlie chuckled to themselves as they recalled Salomon doing business with another shady character they didn't name. At the 2002 annual meeting, however, Charlie identified the company as Normandy America Inc., whose IPO Salomon had to pull before money exchanged hands when they discovered the promoter had completely manufactured his record. According to a report on the SEC's website, "Normandy's stock commenced trading on the NASDAQ National Market System on August 15, 1995. One day later, Normandy withdrew it offering from the market and rescinded all trades."

That was a wonderful experience (dripping with sarcasm). Warren, Lou Simpson and I were all on the board of Salomon, we were the largest shareholders, and we said "Don't do business with this guy." But they ignored us and said that the underwriting committee had approved it.

Buffett: He had a neon sign on him saying "CROOK". He did go to jail. Incidentally, he claimed to have owned a lot of Berkshire stick and to have made a lot of money on it, but I checked the shareholder records and couldn't see it. It could have been in street's name, but for a block that big, I think I would have found it (so he was probably lying about his Berkshire holdings.)


## Critique of Accountants
### Demise of Ethics Among the Major Accounting Firms
When I was younger, the major accounting firms were quite ethical places, and nobody got filthy rich. But in the space of twenty-five years, they sold out to terrible behavior, one little step at a time. Once you start doing something bad, then it's easy to take the next step - and in the end, you're a moral sewer. The idea that the major accounting firms of the country would sell obviously fraudulent tax shelters...

Too many law and accounting firms get roped into shady things. For example, tax shelters, with their contingency fees and secrecy, are a total abomination.

You'll better understand the evil of top audit firms starting to sell fraudulent tax shelters when I tell you that one told me that they're better (than the others) because they only sold the schemes to their top twenty clients, so no one would notice.

### Aggressive Accounting

We're so horrified by aggressive accounting (that is rampant in Corporate America) that we reach for ways to be conservative. It helps our business decisions and protects Berkshire. How did we get in situations where we're all so close to the line?

Creative accounting is an absolute curse to civilization. One could argue that double-entry bookkeeping was one of history's great advances. Using accounting for fraud and folly is a disgrace. In a democracy, it often takes a scandal to trigger reform. Enron was the most obvious example of a business culture gone wrong in a long, long time.

### Misuse of EBITDA
I think that, every time you see the word EBITDA, you should substitute the words "bullshit earnings."

### Arthur Andersen
I regard what happened to the innocent employees of Arthur Andersen as very unfair, but capitalism without failure is like religion without hell. When it gets this bad and there's lack of systems for control - which Arthur Andersen didn't have - maybe a firm should just go down.

We couldn't do anything that would bring down Berkshire. Arthur Andersen was particularly vulnerable because it was a partnership. A partnership must be extra careful in its behavior, choosing clients, etc.

### The scandal of American Pension Fund accounting
The current practice of using unrealistically high assumptions for pension plan returns is a dumb and improper way to handle things. But if you talk to management, their eyes glaze over even before hostility comes.

Pension fund accounting is drifting into scandal by using unrealistic assumptions. It's human nature to extrapolate the recent past into the future, but it's terrible that managements go along with this.

IBM just raised its return expectations for its pension fund to ten percent. Most companies are at nine percent. We think six percent is more realistic. Company leaders may believe it - they're honest people - but subconsciously they believe it because they want to believe it. It makes earnings good so they can promote the stock.

> The reason accountants don't say anything is best summed up by the saying "Whose bread I eat, his song I sing." I think you're getting very foolish numbers in America accounting. I don't think it's willful dishonesty, but it might as well be.


### Bad accounting leads to immorality
People who have loose accounting standards are just inviting perfectly horrible behavior in other people. And it's a sin, it's an absolute sin. If you carry bushel baskets full of money through the ghetto, and made it easy to steal, that would be a considerable human sin because you'd be causing a lot of bad behavior, and the bad behavior would spread. Similarly, an institution that uses sloppy accounting commits a real human sin, and it's also a dumb way to do business.


## Critique of Stock Options
### Stock options as compensation

If you look at the impact of stock options, you'll see a lot of terrible behavior. To give a lot of options to a CEO who built the business and is in his sixties, to incent loyalty, is demented. Would the doctors at the Mayo Clinic or the lawyers at Cravath who are in their sixties work harder if they had options?

As our shareholders know, our system is different from most big corporations. We think it's less capricious. The stock option system may give extraordinary rewards to some people who did nothing, and give nothing to those who deserve a lot. Except when we inherit it (a stock option program), we don't use it.

### Valuing options and the Black Scholes Model
Black-Scholes works for short-term options, but if it's a long-term option and you think you know something (about the underlying asset), it's insane to use Black-Scholes.

Black-Scholes is a know-nothing system. If you know nothing about value - only price - then Black-Scholes is a pretty good guess at what a ninety-day option might be worth. But the minute you get into longer periods of time, it's crazy to get into Black-Scholes.

For example, at Costco we issued stock options with strike prices of $30 and $60, and Black Scholes valued the $60 ones higher. This is insane.

### Accounting for stock options
The theory that options have no cost has contributed to a lot of excesses, which is bad for the country because corporate compensation is perceived as unfair.

I'm so tired of this subject. I've been on this topic for so long. It's such a rotten way to run a civilization to make the accounting wrong. It's like getting the engineering wrong when making a bridge. When perfectly reputable people say options shouldn't be expensed, it's outrageous.

A stock option is both an expense *and* dilution. To argue anything else is insane.
These people (the eighty-eight senators who voted to maintain the status quo of not expensing stock options) are stupid and dishonorable. They knew it was wrong and did it anyway.

The only thing that's consistent is that the whole thing is disgusting. I'd rather make my money playing piano in a whorehouse than account for options as recommended by John Doerr.

## Warnings about Financial Institutions and Derivatives
### Risk of financial institutions
The nature of a financial institution is that there are a lot of ways to go to hell in a bucket. You can push credit too far, do a dumb acquisition, leverage yourself excessively - it's not just derivatives that can bring your downfall.

Maybe it's unique to us, but we're quite sensitive to financial risks. Financial institutions make us nervous when they're trying to do well.

We're exceptionally goosey of leveraged financial institutions. If they start talking about how good risk management is, it makes us nervous.

We fret way earlier than other people. We've left a lot of money on the table through early fretting. It's the way we are - you'll just have to live with it.

### Derivatives
The system is almost insanely irresponsible. And what people think are fixed aren't really fixes. It's so complicated I can't do it justice here - but you can't believe the trillions of dollars involved. You can't believe the complexity. You can't believe how difficult is is to do the accounting. You can't believe how big the incentives are to have wishful thinking about values and wishful thinking about ability to clear.

People don't think about the consequences of the consequences. People start by trying to hedge against interest rate changes, which is very difficult and complicated. Then, the hedges make the reported profits lumpy. So then they use new derivatives to smooth this. Well, now you've morphed into lying. This turns into a Mad Hatter's Tea Party. This happens to vast, sophisticated corporations.

Somebody has to step in and say "We're not going to do it - it's just too hard."

I think a good litmus test of the mental and moral quality at any large institution with significant derivatives exposure would be to ask them, "Do you really understand your derivatives book?" Anyone who says yes is either crazy or lying.

It's easy to see the dangers when you talk about what happened with the energy derivatives - they went kerflooey. When the companies reached for the assets that were on the books, the money wasn't there. When it comes to financial assets, we haven't had any such denouement, and the accounting hasn't changed, so the denouement is ahead of us.

Derivatives are full of clauses that say if one party's credit gets downgraded, then it has to put up collateral. It's like margin - you can go broke just putting up more margin. In attempting to protect themselves, they've introduced instability. Nobody seems to recognize what a disaster of a system they have created. It's a demented system. 

In engineering people have a big margin of safety. But in the financial world, people don't give a damn about safety. They let it balloon and balloon and balloon. It's aided by false accounting. I'm more pessimistic about this than Warren.

### Accounting for Derivatives
I hate with a passion GAAP as applied to derivatives and swaps. JP Morgan sold out to this type of accounting to front-end revenues. I think it's a disgrace.

It's bonkers, and the accountants sold out. Everyone caved, adopted loose accounting standards, and created exotic derivatives linked to theoretical models. As a result, all kinds of earnings, blessed by accountants, are not really being earned. When you reach for the money, it melts away. It was never there.

It is just disgusting. It is a sewer, and if I'm right, there will be hell to pay in due course. All of you will have to prepare to deal with a blowup of derivative books.

To say accounting for derivatives in America is a sewer is an insult to sewage.

### Likelihood of a derivatives blowup
We tried to sell Gen Re's derivatives operation and couldn't, so we started liquidating it. We had to take big markdowns. I would confidently predict that most of the derivatives books of this country's major banks cannot be liquidated for anything like what they're carried on the books at. When the denouement will happen and how severe it will be, I don't know. But I fear the consequences could be fearsome. I think there are major problems, worse than in the energy field, and look at the destruction there.

I'll be amazed if we don't have some kind of significant derivatives-related blowup in the next five to ten years.

I think we're the only big corporation in America to be running off its derivative book.

It's a crazy idea for people who are already rich - like Berkshire - to be in this business. It's a crazy business for big banks to be in.

## Critique of Lawyers, Law Firms, and Litigation

### Demise of Ethics among Law Firms

I never have the slightest interest in defending miscreants and helping them misbehave. But the general view is that it's wonderful what Johnny Cochran did (getting O.J. Simpson off).

### Lawyers butchered the Martha Stewart case
What happened with Martha Stewart was that she heard some news, panicked, and sold the stock. It turns out that if she'd just told the truth, she'd have been okay. But because she had a vague idea that what she'd done was wrong, she had a totally phony story when the investigators came and she lied to them and that's a felony. And she did these facts *after* she'd hired highfalutin' lawyers! And I'm sure they charged her a lot. I do not invent these stories.

Were I her lawyer, I would have said "You know, Martha, that's an interesting story, and I'm your lawyer, so I'm required to believe you, but nobody else will. So, you're going to have to come up with a different story, or you'll have to tell it through a different lawyer because I don't like losing cases." And it will work. It's so simple. Literally, she went to prison for her behavior *after* she'd hired a lawyer!

### The Tort System
What's particularly pernicious is the increasing political power of the plaintiffs' bar. State supreme court judges are generally on for life. The only thing that can jeopardize this is for them to really anger some important group - like the plaintiff's bar. Thus, the judges allow junk science and the like.

Because of the tort system, there are whole areas for the already rich to avoid. For example, a company developed a new, safer, better police helmet but sold the product to a judgment-proof company (because the helmet-developer was afraid of liability). It would be crazy for Berkshire to be in the business of providing security guard at airports. The system discourages the best companies from entering certain businesses.

### Asbestos and Tort Reform
Asbestos has morphed into a situation with enormous amounts of fraud. People with serious injuries are being hurt (as more money flows to the plaintiff's bar and to claimants with no current injuries). The Supreme Court has practically invited Congress to step in, but Congress has refused due to the influence of the trial lawyers. I'd be surprised if there's a constructive solution in the next five years. I expect there will be more of the current mess.

What's happened in asbestos is that a given group of people get mesothelioma - a horrible cancer that comes only from asbestos exposure and kills people. Then, there's another group of claimants who smoked two packs of cigarettes a day and have a spot on their lung. Then you have a lawyer who gets a doctor to testify that every spot is caused by asbestos. Once you effectively bribe a doctor, then you can get millions of people to sue on fears of getting cancer.

But there's not enough money to pay all of the claimants, so people who are truly harmed don't get enough. In a southern state with a jury pool that hates all big companies you get big judgments, but lawyers are stealing money from people who are hurt and giving it to people who aren't entitled. It's a bonkers system, but with the federalism, there's no way to stop it. The Supreme Court refused to step in.

Trying to buy people off is like trying to put out a fire by dousing it with gasoline. With word processors, lawyers can easily produce countless claimants. But only twenty-five percent of the money goes to the claimants - the rest goes to the lawyers, doctors, etc.

If you want to be cynical, look at the perjury. There are only three solvent companies left (facing asbestos claims), so plaintiffs can only remember those three names (when recalling which products they were exposed to decades ago). It's a case of perjury being suborned by practicing lawyers.

The only people who can fix it are the Supreme Court of Congress. The Supreme Court - some people would say rightly - refused to get involved, but I say they chickened out. And Congress, given the politics, has yet to step in.

There's an important lesson here: Once wrongdoers get rich, they get enormous political power and you can't stop it, so the key is to nip things like this in the bud.

It would be easy to fix the problem: the right way is to say we're not going to pay off all these little claims.

### The Government's lawsuit against Microsoft
[April 2000] Someone whose salary is paid by US taxpayers is happy to dramatically weaken the one place where we're winning big?

Every business tries to turn this year's success into next year's greater success. It's hard for me to see why Microsoft is sinful to do this. If it's a sin, then I hope all of Berkshire Hathaway's subsidiaries are sinners.
