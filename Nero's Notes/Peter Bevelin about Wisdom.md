> Real Wisdom is not the knowledge of everything, but the knowledge of which things in life are necessary, which are less necessary, and which are completely unnecessary to know. And what could be more useful than learning the big and timeless principles that tell you how the world works - how reality works, how human nature works - so you know what to do or not to do in different situations?

Always try to determine what the key factors or causes for what you want to achieve are and then make sure you get them right. And you can't do that if you don't first get your toolbox of ideas. 

We also need to look for the Achilles heel - the key factor that could turn someone or a system into a catastrophe. 


*Independently of if I'm looking for investment success, getting a good job, great friends, a spouse or what have you, I should try to figure out what the one or two most important factors for success are and focus on them. Or to take the Jacobi approach - the key factors for misery in those areas.*
