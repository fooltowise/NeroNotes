# Natural Selection and Aging

[[Evolution - Natural Selection and Extinction]] only needs to ensure that the majority of individuals in a species survive sufficiently long to produce enough offsprings to maximize their evolutionary fitness. 

Once this has happened and they have performed their evolutionary duty, how much longer their lives is of much less importance and large variation in individuals and species lifespan can be expected.
