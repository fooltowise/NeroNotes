# Agency Business Model

From a business perspective, when the customer is not involved directly in the purchasing decision, then higher prices can be used to bribe the purchaser's agent and can result in both higher margins and sales volumes. From an economist's perspective, the customer experiences an agency problem.

Agency creates the potential for supernormal profits and [[Competitive Advantage]] for both agents and producers.

Normal relations between provider, intermediary and consumer are distorted when the consumer lacks understanding and relies on a supposedly independent intermediary. In many cases the relationship between the intermediary and the provider has developed to the point where these parties form a tacit alliance to exploit consumer ignorance.

A few examples:
[[Structured Products industry]]
[[Geberit's business model]]
[[Dental Implants industry]]
[[Hearing Aid industry]]
[[Testing Industry]]

Customers will often pay more when an agent is involved. In all of the cases above, value is being transferred from the person who pays to the agent, with the producer taking a large slice of the pie. 

The agent's interest is safety, quality, reliability, availability, and of course his own interest to earn a commission. Under such circumstances, price is a pass-through to the end customer, for whom product costs represent a small part of the total bill.


Just as agency problems in the fund management industries have shown remarkable persistence, it would not be surprising that the superior profitability of these companies exploiting agency will endure.
