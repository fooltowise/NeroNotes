# Skin in the Game

Skin in the game acts as an incentive **and** as a filter that removes dangerous individuals from the community and prevents dangerous behaviors from spreading.

Sociality helps aligning incentives within a community and conserving precious variance. It makes one feel like he cannot act against his community and jump ships.

Here are some practical applications:
- **Be wary of advice from people without skin in the game**
- **Be wary of envying people without skin in the game.** Imitating them might expose you to problems you didn't consider.
- **Careful of removing social bonding from your life or organization in the name of efficiency**: it has a purpose.


Skin in the game is a good tool to remove absorption states and improve [[Ergodicity]]
