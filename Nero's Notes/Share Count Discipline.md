# Share Count Discipline

Per share discipline is much misunderstood by investors. The long-term rate of share issuance in the US is over three percent per annum, comparable to the trend growth in the economy and far exceeding population growth. And whilst it can be argued that something is normally bought with the shares issued, it is also true that some items, such as incentive compensation, have a shorter shelf life than newly issued shares that may remain outstanding forever.

**Buying transitory outcomes (e.g, a manager with a one-year employment contract) with permanent capital is a duration mismatch a bond investor might understand, but short-term equity investors care little about, and so the dripping tap of share issuance is rarely turned off.**
