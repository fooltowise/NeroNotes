# A Lesson on Elementary, Worldly Wisdom, Revisited

## Stanford Law School
### April 19, 1996

What I'm going to try today is to extend the remarks I made two years ago at the USC Business School. You were assigned a transcript of my [[A Lesson on Elementary Worldly Wisdom| USC Talk]]. And there's nothing I said then that I wouldn't repeat today. But I want to amplify what I said then.

It's perfectly clear... that if Warren Buffett had never learned anything new after graduating from Columbia Business School, Berkshire would be a pale shadow of its present self. Warren would have gotten rich - because what he learned from Ben Graham at Columbia was enough to make anybody rich. But he wouldn't have the kind of enterprise Berkshire Hathaway is if he hadn't kept learning.

How do you get worldly wisdom? What system do you use to rise into the tiny top percentage of the world in terms of having sort of an elementary practical wisdom?

I've long believed that a certain system - which almost any intelligent person can learn - works way better than the systems that most people use. As I said at the USC School, what you need is a latticework of mental models in your head. And you hang your actual experience and you vicarious experience (that you get from reading and so forth) on this latticework of powerful models. And, with that system, things gradually get to fit together in a way that enhances cognition.

Your assigned reading for today included the latest annual letters from Jack Welch and Warren Buffett relating to General Electric and Berkshire Hathaway, respectively. Jack Welch has a PhD in engineering. And Warren plainly could have gotten a PhD in any field he wanted to pursue. And both gentlemen are inveterate teachers.

Worldly wisdom is quite academic when you get right down to it. Look at what General Electric has achieved - and, for that matter, what Berkshire Hathaway has achieved.

Of course, Warren had a professor/mentor - Ben Graham - for whom he had a great affection. Graham was so academic that when he graduated from Columbia, three different academic departments invited him into their PhD programs and asked him to start teaching immediately as part of the PhD program: those three departments being literature, Greek and Latin classics, and mathematics.

Graham had a very academic personality. I knew him. He was a lot like Adam Smith - very preoccupied, very brilliant. He even looked like an academic. And was a good one. And Graham, without ever really trying to maximize the gaining of wealth, died rich - even though he was always generous and spent thirty years teaching at Columbia and authored or coauthored the best textbooks in his field.

So I would argue that academia has a lot to teach about worldly wisdom and that the best academic values really work.

Of course, when I urge a multidisciplinary approach - that you've got to have the main models from a broad array of disciplines and you've got to use them all - I 'm really asking you to ignore jurisdictional boundaries.

And the world isn't organized that way. It discourages the jumping of jurisdictional boundaries. Big bureaucratic businesses discourage it. And, of course, academia itself discourages it. All I can say is that, in that respect, academia is horribly wrong and dysfunctional.

And some of the worst dysfunctions in businesses come from the fact that they balkanize reality into little individual departments with territoriality and turf protection and so forth. So if you want to be a good thinker, you must develop a mind that can jump the jurisdictional boundaries.

You don't have to know it all. Just take in the best big ideas from all these disciplines. And it's not that hard to do.

I might try and demonstrate that point by using the analogy of the card game of contract bridge. Suppose you want to be good at declarer play in contract bridge. Well, you know the contract - you know what you have to achieve. And you can count up the sure winners you have by laying down you high cards and your invincible trumps. 

But if you're a trick or two short, how are you going to get the other needed tricks? Well, there are only six or so different, standard methods. You've got long suit establishment. You've got finesses. You've got throw-in plays. You've got crossruffs. You've got squeezes. And you've got various ways of misleading the defense into making errors. So it's a very limited number of models.

But if you only know one or two of those models, then you're going to be a horse's patoot in declarer play.

Furthermore, these things interact. Therefore, you have to know how the models interact. Otherwise, you can't play the hand right.

Similarly, I've told you to think forward and backward. Well, great declarers in bridge think, "How can I take the necessary winners?" But they think it through backwards too. They also think, "What could possibly go wrong that could cause me to have too many losers?" And both methods of thinking are useful. So to win in the game of life, get the needed models into your head and think it through forward and backward. What works in bridge will work in life.

That contract bridge is so out of vogue in your generation is a tragedy. China is way smarter than we are about bridge. They're teaching bridge in grade school now. And God knows the Chinese do well enough when introduced to capitalist civilization. If we compete with a bunch of people that really know how to play bridge when our people don't, it'll be just one more disadvantage we don't need.

Since your academic structure, by and large, doesn't encourage minds jumping jurisdictional boundaries, you're at a disadvantage because, in that one sense, even though academia's very useful to you, you've been mistaught.

My solution for you is one that I got at a very early age from the nursery: the story of the Little Red Hen. The punchline, of course, is "Then I'll do it myself, said the Little Red Hen."

So if your professors won't give you an appropriate multidisciplinary approach - if each wants to overuse his own models and under-use the important models in other disciplines - you can correct that folly yourself. Just because he's a horse's patoot, you don't have to be one, too. You can reach out and grasp the model that better solves the overall problem. All you have to do is know it and develop the right mental habits.

And it's kind of fun to sit there and out-think people who are way smarter than you are because you've trained yourself to be more objective and multidisciplinary...

Furthermore, there's a lot of money in it - as I can testify from my own personal experience.

(*Charlie begins the Coca-Cola business case detailed in Talk Four, "Practical Thought about Practical Thought", and discusses the importance of flavor.*)


One of my favorite business stories comes from Hershey. They get their flavor because they make their cocoa butter in old stone grinders that they started with in 1800s in Pennsylvania. And a little bit of the husk of the cocoa bean winds up in the chocolate. Therefore, they get that odd flavor that people like in Hershey's chocolate.

Hershey knew enough when they wanted to expand into Canada to know they shouldn't change their winning flavor. Therefore, they copied their stone grinders. Well, it took them five years to duplicate their own flavor. As you can see, flavors can be quite tricky.

Even today, there's a company called International Flavors and Fragrances. It's the only company I know that does something on which you can't get a copyright or a patent, but which nevertheless receives a permanent royalty. They manage to do that by helping companies develop flavors and aromas in their trademarked products - like shaving cream. The slight aroma of shaving cream is very important to consumption. So all of this stuff is very important.

*(Continuing the Coca-Cola case study, Charlie explains how our understanding of graphic depictions of mathematical ideas are rooted in biology.)*

My friend, Dr. Nat Myhrvold, who's the chief technology officer at Microsoft, is bothered by this. He's a PhD physicist and knows a lot of math. And it disturbs him that biology could create a neural apparatus that could do automatic differential equations at fast speed - and, yet, everywhere he looks, people are total klutzes at dealing with ordinary probabilities and ordinary numbers.

By the way, I think Myhrvold is wrong to be amazed by that. The so-called fitness landscape of our ancestors forced them to know how to throw spears, run around, turn corners, and have you long before they had to think correctly like Myhrvold. So I don't think he should be so surprised. However, the difference is so extreme that I can understand how he finds it incongruous.

At any rate, mankind invented a system to cope with the fact that we are so intrinsically lousy at manipulating numbers. It's called the [[Graph]]. Oddly enough, it came out of the Middle Ages. And it's the only intellectual invention of the monks during the Middle Ages I know of that's worth a damn. **The graph puts numbers in a form that looks like motion.** So it's using some of this primitive stuff in your system in a way that helps you understand it. So the Value Line graphs are very useful. 

The graph I've distributed is on log paper - which is based on the natural tables of logarithms. And that's based on the elementary mathematics of [[Compound Interest]] - which is one of the most important models there is on earth. So there is a reason why that graph is in that form.

And if you draw a straight line through data points on a graph on log paper, it will tell you the rate at which compound interest is working for you. So these graphs are marvelously useful...

I don't use Value Line's predictions because our system works better for us than theirs - in fact, a lot better. But I can't imagine not having their graphs and their data. It's a marvelous, marvelous product...

*(Charlie discusses the importance of trademarks to Coca-Cola's success and carries it over to a discussion of food products and Carnation.)*

Now, when Carnation tried to make a deal for its [[Patent, Trademark, Exclusive Franchise| trademark]], there was this one guy who sold Carnation Fish. So help me God, that was his trade name. Don't ask me why. And every time they'd say, "We'll pay you $250'000", he'd say "I want $400'000." And then, four years later, they'd say "We'll give you $1'000'000." and he'd say "I want $2'000'000." And they just kept doing that all the way through. And they never did buy the trademark - at least, they hadn't bought it the last time I looked.

In the end, Carnation came to him sheepfacedly and said, "We'd like to put our quality control inspectors into your fish plants to make sure that your fish are perfect; and we'll pay all the costs" - which he quickly and smirkily allowed. So he got free quality control in his fish plants - courtesy of the Carnation Company.

The history shows the enormous incentive you create if you give a guy a trademark he can protect. And this incentive is very useful to the wide civilization. As you see, Carnation got so that it was protecting  products that it didn't even own.

That sort of outcome is very, very desirable for society. So there are some very fundamental microeconomic reasons why even communist countries should protect trademarks. They don't all do it, but there are very powerful reasons why they should. And, by and large, averaged out around the world, trademark protection's been pretty good.

*(Charlie applies various mental models to Coca-cola.)*

However, if you don't have the basic models and the basic mental models for dealing with the models, then all you can do is to sit there twiddling your thumbs as you look at the Value Line graph. But you don't have to twiddle your thumbs. You've got to learn one hundred models and a few mental tricks and keep doing it all of your life. It's not that hard.

And the beauty of it is that most people won't do it - partly because they've been miseducated. And I'm here trying to help you avoid some the perils that might otherwise result from that miseducation.

OK. We've been through some of the general ideas in the search for worldly wisdom. And now I want to turn to something even more extreme and peculiar than the talk I've already given you. Of all the models that people ought to have in useful form and don't, perhaps the most important lie in the area of psychology.

I recently had an instructive experience: I just returned from Hong Kong. I have a pal there who's a headmaster of one of the leading schools. He gave me the book called *The Language Instinct*, written by Steven Pinker. Well, Pinker is a semanticist professor who rose in the shadow of Noam Chomsky - Linguistics Institute Professor at MIT - who is probably the greatest semanticist who ever lived.

And Pinker says that human language ability is not just learned - it's deeply buried, to a considerable extent, in the genome. It's not in the genome of the other animals, including the chimpanzee, to any really useful extent. It's a gift that came to humans. And Pinker proves his point pretty well.

Of course, Chomsky's already proven it. You have to be pretty ignorant not to realize that a good deal of language ability is right there in the human genome. And even though you have to work like hell to improve it through education, you start with a big leg up in your genes.

Pinker can't understand why Chomsky - who, again, is such a genius - take the position that the jury's still out about why this ability is in the human genome. Pinker, in effect, says: "Like hell, the jury is still out! The language instinct got into humans exactly the same way that everything else got there - through Darwinian natural selection."

Well, the junior Professor is clearly right - and Chomsky's hesitation is a little daft.

But if the junior professor and I are right, how has a genius like Chomsky made an obvious misjudgment? The answer's quite clear to me - Chomsky is passionately ideological. He is an extreme egalitarian leftist who happens to be a genius. And he's so smart that he realized that if he concedes this particular Darwinian point, the implication threaten his leftist ideology. So he naturally has his conclusion affected by his ideological bias.

And that gets into another lesson in worldly wisdom : If [[Ideology]] can screw up the head of Chomsky, imagine what it does to people like you and me.

Heavy ideology is one of the most extreme distorters of human cognition. Look at these Islamic fundamentalists who just gunned down a bunch of Greek tourists shouting "God's work!"

Ideology does some strange things and distorts cognition terribly. If you get a lot of heavy ideology young - and then you start expressing it - you are really locking your brain into a very unfortunate pattern. And you are going to distort you general cognition.

That's a very interesting history if you take Warren Buffett as an example of worldly wisdom: Warren adored his father - who was a wonderful man. But Warren's father was a very heavy ideologue (right wing, it happened to be), who hung around with other very heavy ideologues (right wing, naturally).

Warren observed that as a kid. And he decided that ideology was dangerous - and that he was going to stay a long way away from it. And he has throughout his whole life. That has enormously helped the accuracy of his cognition.

I learned the same lesson in a different way. My father hated ideology. Therefore, all I had to do was imitate my father and, thereby, stay on what I regard as the right path. People like Dornan on the right or Nader on the left have obviously gone a little daft. They're extreme examples of what ideology will do to you - particularly violently expressed ideology. Since it pounds ideas in better than it convinces out, it's a very dangerous thing to do. 

Therefore, in a system of multiple models across multiple disciplines, I should add as an extra rule that you should be very wary of heavy ideology.

You can have heavy  ideology in favor of accuracy, diligence, and objectivity. But a heavy ideology that makes you absolutely sure that the minimum wage should be raised or that it shouldn't - and it's kind of a holy construct where you know you're right - makes you a bit nuts.

This is a very complicated system. And life is one damn relatedness after another. It's all right to think that, on balance, you suspect that civilization is better if it lowers the minimum wage or raises it. Either position is OK. But being totally sure on issues like that with a strong, violent ideology, in my opinion, turns you into a lousy thinker. So beware of ideology- based mental misfunctions.

*(Charlie laments how poorly the field of psychology deals with incentive-caused bias.)*

Another reason that I recommend Pinker, the semanticist who wrote the book that I told you about earlier, is that at the end of his book, he says (roughly) "I've read the psychology textbooks. And they're daft." He says, "This whole subject is misorganized and mistaught."

Well, I have far less in the way of qualifications than Pinker. In fact, I've never taken a single course in psychology. However, I've come to exactly the same conclusion - that the psychology texts. while they are wonderful in part, are also significantly daft.

In fact, just take simple psychological denial. About three centuries before the birth of Christ, Demosthenes said **"What a man wishes, that also he will believe."** Well, Demosthenes was right.

I had a family acquaintance whose much-loved son - who was brilliant and a star football player - flow off over the ocean and never came back. Well, his mother thought he was still alive. The mind will sometimes flip so that the wish becomes the belief. (See [[Pain reducing psychological denial]]). It will do so at various levels. Individuals very in how much psychological denial they get. But miscognition from denial overwhelmingly pervades the reality that you're going to have to deal with. And yet, you won't find an adequate treatment of simple psychological denial in psychology texts.

So you can't learn psychology the way your professors teach it. You've got to learn everything they teach. But you've got to learn a lot more that they don't teach - because they don't handle their own subject correctly.

Psychology to me, as currently organized, is like electromagnetism after Faraday, but before Maxwell - a lot has been discovered, but not one mind has put it all together in proper form. And it should be done because it wouldn't be that hard to do - and it's enormously important.

Just open a psychology text, turn to the index, and look up [[Envy]]. Well, envy made it into one or two or three of the Ten Commandments. Moses knew well all about envy. The old Jews, when they were herding sheep, knew all about envy. It's just that psychology professors don't know about envy.

Books that thick are teaching a psychology course without envy?! And with no simple psychological denial? And no [[Incentives|Incentive-caused bias]]?

And psychological texts don't deal adequately with combinations of factors. I told you earlier to be aware of the [[Lollapalooza Effect]] effect when two or three or more forces are operating in the same direction.

Well, the single most publicized psychology experiment ever done is the [[Milgram Experiment]] - where they asked people to apply what they had every reason to believe was heavy electrical torture on innocent fellow human beings. And they manipulated mos of these decent volunteers into doing the torture.

Milgram performed the experiment right after Hitler had gotten a bunch of believing Lutherans, Catholics, and so forth to perform unholy acts they should have known were wrong. He was trying to find out how much authority could be used to manipulate high-grade people into doing things that were clearly and grossly wrong.

And he got a very dramatic effect. He managed to get high-grade people to do many awful things.

But for years, it was in the psychology books as a demonstration of authority - how authority could be used to persuade people to do awful things.

Of course, that's mere [[First Conclusion Bias]]. That's not the complete and correct explanation. Authority is part of it. However, were were also quite a few other psychological principles, all operating in the same direction, that achieved that lollapalooza effect precisely because they acted in combination toward the same end.

People have gradually figured that out. And if you read the recent psychology texts at a place like Stanford, you'll see that they've now managed to get it about two-thirds right. However, here's the main experiment in all of psychology. And even at Stanford, they still leave out some of the important causes of Milgram's experiment.

How can smart people be so wrong? Well, the answer is that they don't do what I'm telling you to do - which is to take all the main models from psychology and use them as a checklist in reviewing outcomes in complex systems.

No pilot takes off without going through his checklist: A, B, C, D... And no bridge player who needs two extra trick plays a hand without going down his checklist and figuring out how to do it.

But these psychology professors think they're so smart that they don't need a checklist. But they aren't that smart. Almost nobody is. Or, maybe, nobody is.

If they used a checklist, they'd realize the Milgram experiment harnesses six psychological principles, at least - not three. All they'd have to do is to go down the checklist to see the ones that they missed.

Similarly, without this system of getting the main models and using them together in a multi-modular way, you'll screw up every time after time after time, too.

One reason psychology professors so screw up denial is that it's hard to do demonstrative experiments without conduct forbidden by ethics. To demonstrate how misery creates mental misfunction in people, think of what you'd have to do to your fellow human beings. And you'd have to do it without telling them about the injury to come. So, clearly, there are ethical reasons why it's practically impossible to do the experiments necessary to best lay out the ways human misery creates human mental misfunction.

Most professors solve this problem, in effect, by assuming, "If I can't demonstrate it with my experiments, then it doesn't exist." However, obviously, that's asinine. If something is very important but can't be perfectly and precisely demonstrated because of ethical constraints, you can't treat it like it doesn't exist. You have to do the best you can with it - with such evidence as is available.

Pavlov himself spent the last ten years of his life torturing dogs. And he published. Thus, we have a vast amount of data about misery-caused mental misfunction in dogs - and its correction. Yet, it's in no introductory psychological book that you'll ever see.

I don't know whether they don't like the fact that Pavlov tortured dogs or whether B.F. Skinner, by overclaiming when he lapsed into his literary mode, made the drawing of implications from animal behavior into human behavior unpopular. However, for some crazy reason or other, the psychology books are grossly inadequate in dealing with misery-caused mental misfunction.

You may say, "What difference does all this psychological ignorance make?" Well, if I'm right, you need these models that are blanked out by this ignorance. And, furthermore, you need them in a form whereby, if there are twenty constructs, you have all twenty. In other words, you shouldn't be operating with ten. And you need to use them as a checklist. So you have to go back and put in your own head what I'd call the psychology of misjudgment in a form whereby you have all of the important models and you can use them.

And you especially need them when four of five forces from these models come together to operate in the same direction. In such cases, you often get lollapalooza effects - which can make you rich or they can kill you. So it's essential that you beware of lollapalooza effects.

There's only one right way to do it: You have to get the main doctrines together and use them as a checklist. And, to repeat for emphasis, you have to pay special attention to combinatorial effects that create lollapalooza consequences.

*(Charlie discusses the lack of multidisciplinary teaching in the professions, especially how the field of psychology is virtually ignored in academia).*

Let me give you an example of that - of wise psychology of yore. In Captain Cook's day, he took these long voyages. At the time, scurvy was the dread of the long voyage. And in scurvy, your living gums putrefy in your mouth - after which the disease gets unpleasant and kills you.

And being on a primitive sailing ship with a bunch of dying sailors is a very awkward business. So everybody was terribly interested in scurvy, but they didn't know about vitamin C. Well, Captain Cook, being a smart man with a multiple-model kind of approach, noticed that Dutch ships had less scurvy than English ships on long voyages. So he said, "What are the Dutch doing that's different?"

And he noticed they had all these barrels of sauerkraut. So he thought, "I'm going on these long voyages. And it's very dangerous. Sauerkraut may help." So he laid in all this sauerkraut, which, incidentally, happens to contain a trace of vitamin C.

But English sailors were a tough, cranky, and dangerous bunch in that day. They hated "krauts". And they were used to their standard food and booze. So how do you get such English sailors to eat sauerkraut?

Well, Cook didn't want to tell'em that he was doing it in the hope it would prevent scurvy - because they might mutiny and take over the ship if they thought that he was taking them on a voyage so long that scurvy was likely.

So here's what he did: Officers ate at one place where the men could observe them. And for a long time, he served sauerkraut to the officers, but not to the men. And, then, finally, Captain Cook said, "Well, the men can have it one day a week."

In due course, he had the whole crew eating sauerkraut. I regard that as a very constructive use of elementary psychology. It may have saved God knows how many lives and caused God knows how much achievement. However, if you don't know the right techniques, you can't use them.

*(Charlie discusses psychological effects in play in marketing of consumer items, such as Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Tupperware, etc.)*

Worldly wisdom is  mostly very, very simple. And what I'm urging on you is not that hard if you have the will to plow through and do it. And the rewards are awesome - absolutely awesome.

But maybe you aren't interested in awesome rewards or avoiding a lot of misery of being more able to serve everything you love in life. And, if that's your attitude, then don't pay attention to what I've been trying to tell you - because you're already on the right track.

It can't be emphasized too much that issues of morality are deeply entwined with worldly wisdom considerations involving psychology. For example, take the issue of stealing. A very significant fraction of the people in the world will steal if (A) it's very easy to do and (B) there's practically no chance of being caught.

And once they start stealing, the [[Bias from Commitment and Consistency| consistency principle]] - which is a big part of human psychology - will soon combine with operant conditioning to make stealing habitual. So if you run a business where it's easy to steal because of your methods, you're working a great moral injury on the people who work for you.

Again, that's obvious. It's very, very important to create human systems that are hard to cheat. Otherwise, you're ruining your civilization because these big incentives will create incentive-caused bias and people will [[Reason as rationalization | rationalize ]] that bad behavior as OK.

Then, if somebody else does it, now you've got at least two psychological principles: incentive-caused bias plus [[Social Proof]]. Not only that, but you get [[Serpico Effects]]: if enough people are profiting in a general social climate of going wrong, then they'll turn on you and become dangerous enemies if you try and blow the whistle.

It's very dangerous to ignore these principles and let slop creep in. Powerful psychological forces are at work for evil.

How does this relate to law business? Well, people graduate from places like Stanford Law School and go into the legislatures of our nation, and , with the best of motives, pass laws that are easily used by people to cheat. Well, there could hardly be a worse thing you could do.

Let's say you have a desire to do public service. As a natural part of your planning, you think in reverse and ask, "What can I do to ruin our civilization?" That's easy. If what you want to do is to ruin our civilization, just go to the legislature and pass laws that create systems wherein people can easily cheat. It will work perfectly.

Take the workers' compensation system in California. Stress is real. And its misery can be real. So you want to compensate people for their stress in the workplace. It seems like a noble thing to do.

But the trouble with such a compensation practice is that it's practically impossible to delete huge cheating. And once you reward cheating, you get crooked lawyers, crooked doctors, crooked unions, etc., participating in referral schemes. You get a total miasma of disastrous behavior. And the behavior makes all the people doing it worse as they do it. So you were trying to help your civilization. But what you did was create enormous damage, net.

So it's much better to let some things go uncompensated - to let life be hard - than to create systems that are easy to cheat.

Let me give you an example: I have a friend who made an industrial product at a plant in Texas not far from the border. He was in a low-margin, tough business. He got massive fraud in the workers' compensation system - to the point that his premiums reached double-digit percentages of payroll. And it was not that dangerous to produce his product. It's not like he was a demolition contractor or something.
So he pleaded with the union "You've got to stop this. There's not enough money in making this product to cover all of this fraud."

But, by then, everyone's used to id. "It's extra income. It's extra money. Everybody does it. It can't be that wrong. Eminent lawyers, eminent doctors, eminent chiropractors - if there are any such things - are cheating."

And no one could tell them, "You can't do it anymore." Incidentally, that's [[Pavlovian Association]], too. When people get bad news, they hate the messenger. Therefore, it was very hard for the union representative to tell all of these people that the easy money was about to stop. That is not the way to advance as a union representative.

So my friend closed his plant and moved the work to Utah among a community of believing Mormons. Well, the Mormons aren't into workers' compensation fraud - at least they aren't in my friend's plant. And guess what his workers' compensation expense is today? It's two percent of payroll - down from double-digits.

This sort of tragedy is caused by letting the slop run. You must stop slop early. it's very hard to stop slop and moral failure if you let it run for a while.

*(Charlie describes his notion of "deprival super-reaction syndrome" as it relates to gambling and the New Coke debacle of the mid-1980s.)*

Of course, as I said before, there is one big consideration that needs huge and special attention as part of any use of techniques deliberately harnessing elementary psychological forces: And that is that once you know how to do it, there are real moral limits regarding how much you should do it. Not all of what you know how to do should you use to manipulate people.

Also, if you're willing to transcend the moral limits and the person you're trying to manipulate realizes what you're doing because he also understands the psychology, he'll hate you. There is wonderfully persuasive evidence of this effect taken from labor relations - some in Israel. So not only are there moral objections, but there are also practical objections - big ones in some cases...


*Q: How do you incorporate psychology in your investment decisions? I think it would be more than just picking products that will appeal to everybody like Coke. After all, there are a lot of smart people out there who obviously think just the way that you showed us today. So are you looking for failure in the thinking of other investors when you go about picking successful companies?*

What makes investment hard, as I said in USC, is that it's easy to see that some companies have better businesses than others. But the price of the stock goes up so high that, all of a sudden, the question of which stock is the best to buy gets quite difficult.

We've never eliminated the difficulty of that problem. And ninety-eight percent of the time, our attitude toward the market is... that we're agnostic. We don't know. Is GM valued properly vis-à-vis Ford? We don't know.

We're always looking for something where we think we have an insight which gives us a big statistical advantage. And sometimes it comes from psychology, but often it comes from something else. And we only find a few - maybe one or two a year. We have no system for having automatic good judgment on all investments decisions that can be made. Ours is a totally different system.

We just look for no-brainer decisions. As Buffett and I say over and over again, we don't leap for seven-foot fences. Instead, we look for one-foot fences with big rewards on the other side. So we've succeeded by making the world easy for ourselves, not by solving hard problems.

*Q: Based on statistical analysis and insight?*

Well, certainly when we do make a decision, we think that we have an insight advantage. And it's true that some of the insight is statistical in nature. However, again, we find only a few of those.

It doesn't help us merely for favorable odds to exist. They have to be in a place where we can recognize them. So it takes a mispriced opportunity that we're smart enough to recognize. And that combination doesn't occur often.

But it doesn't have to. If you wait for the big opportunity and have the courage and vigor to grasp it firmly when it arrives, how many do you need? For example, take the top ten business investments Berkshire Hathaway's ever made. We would be very rich if we'd never done anything else - in two lifetimes.

So, once again, we don't have any system for giving you perfect investment judgment on all subjects at all times. That would be ridiculous. I'm just trying to give you a method you can use to sift reality to obtain an occasional opportunity for rational reaction.

If you take that method into something as competitive as common stock picking, you're competing with many brilliant people. So, even with our method, we only get a few opportunities. Fortunately, that happens to be enough.

*Q: Have you been successful in creating an atmosphere where people below you can do the same things you're talking about doing yourself? For example, you talked about the tendency towards commitment and consistency...*

Mostly about the terrible mistakes it causes you to make.

*Q: How have you created an atmosphere comfortable enough for people to abandon that tendency and admit that they've made a mistake?*

*For example, someone here earlier this year from Intel talked about problems that occurred with their Pentium chip. One of the most difficult things for them to do was to realize they'd been going about it the wrong way and turn course. And it's very difficult to do that in a complex structure. How do you foster that?*

Intel and its ilk create a coherent culture where teams solve difficult problems on the cutting edge of science. That's radically different from Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire is a holding company. We've decentralized all the power except for natural headquarters- type capital allocation.

By and large, we've chosen people we admire enormously to have the power beneath us. It's easy for us to get along with them on average because we love and admire them. And they create the culture for whatever invention and reality recognition is going on in their businesses. And included in that reality recognition is the recognition that previous conclusions were incorrect.

But we're a totally different kind of company. It's not at all clear to me that Warren or I would be that good at doing what Andy Grove does. We don't have special competence in that field. We are fairly good at relating to brilliant people we love. But we have defects. For example, some regard me as absent-minded and opinionated. I might be a mess at Intel.

However, both Warren and I are very good at changing our prior conclusions. We work at developing that facility because, without it, disaster often comes.

*Q: Would you talk a little bit about your seeming predilection away from investing in high technology stocks - on your own part and the part of Berkshire Hathaway. One of the things I've found eye-opening and a little surprising is how the difficulties of running a low-tech business and those of running a high-tech business aren't all that different.*

They're all hard. But why should it be easy to get rich? In a competitive world, shouldn't it be impossible for there to be an easy way for everybody to get rich? Of course, they're all hard.

The reason we're not in high-tech businesses is that we have a special lack of aptitude in that area. And, yes - a low-tech business can be plenty hard. Just try to open a restaurant and make it succeed.

*Q: You seem to be suggesting that there's special aptitude required in high-tech businesses - that they're harder. But aren't they equally difficult?*

The advantage of low-tech stuff for us is that we think we understand it fairly well. The other stuff we don't. And we'd rather deal with what we understand.

Why should we want to play a competitive game in a field where we have no advantage - maybe a disadvantage - instead of in a field where we have a clear advantage?

Each of you will have to figure out where your talents lie. And you'll have to use your advantages. But if you try to succeed in what you're worst at, you're going to have a very lousy career. I can almost guarantee it. To do otherwise, you'd have to buy a winning lottery ticket or get very lucky somewhere else.

*Q: Warren Buffett has said that the investment Berkshire made in an airline was a good example of what not to do. What chain of thinking led to that wrong decision?*

We were not buying stock in USAir on the theory that the common shareholders were certain to prosper - because the history of the airline business in terms of taking care of shareholders has been terrible. It was a preferred stock with a mandatory redemption. In effect, we were loaning  money to USAir, and we had this equity kicker.

We weren't guessing whether it would be a great place for the shareholders. We were guessing whether it would remain prosperous enough to pay off a credit instrument - carrying a fixed dividend and a mandatory redemption. And we guessed that the business would not get so bad that we'd have a credit threat for which we were not being adequately compensated by the high rate we were getting. As it happened, USAir went right to the brink of going broke. It was hanging by a thread for several months. It's since come back. And we'll probably get all our money back plus the whole coupon. But it was a mistake.

I don't want you to think we have any way of learning or behaving so you won't make a lot of mistakes. I'm just saying that you can learn to make fewer mistakes than other people - and how to fix your mistakes faster when you do make them.

But there's no way that you can live an adequate life without making many mistakes.

In fact, one trick in life is to get so you can handle mistakes. **Failure to handle psychological denial is a common way for people to go broke.** You've made an enormous commitment to something. You've poured effort and money in. And the more you put in, the more that the whole consistency principle makes you think, "Now it has to work. If I put in just a little more, then it'll work."

And deprival super-reaction syndrome also comes in: You're going to lose the whole thing is you don't put in a little more. People go broke that way - because they can't stop, rethink, and say: "I can afford to write this one off and live to fight again. I don't have to pursue this thing as an obsession - in a way that will break me."

Part of what you must learn is how to handle mistakes and new facts that change the odds (see [[Bayes Theorem]]).  Life, in part, is like a poker game, wherein you have to learn to quit sometimes when holding a much-loved hand.

*Q: Could you talk about the thoughts that went into your decision to swap you Capital Cities stock for Disney rather than taking cash. In the media, it was reported that you mentioned thinking about the cash.*

Disney's a perfectly marvelous company, but it's also very high-priced. Part of what it does is to make ordinary movies - which is not a business that attracts me at all. However, part of what Disney has is better than a great gold mine. My grandchildren - I mean, those videocassettes...

Disney is a amazing example of [[Catalysts| Autocatalysis]]... They had all those movies in the can. They owned the copyright. And just as Coke could prosper when refrigeration came, when the videocassette was invented, Disney didn't have to invent anything or do anything except take the thing out of the can and stick it on the cassette. And every parent and grandparent wanted his descendants to sit around and watch that stuff at home on videocassette. So Disney got this enormous tailwind from life. And it was billions of dollars worth of tail wind.

Obviously, that's a marvelous model if you can find it. You don't have to invent anything. All you have to do is to sit there while the world carries you forward...

Disney's done a lot of new things right. Don't misunderstand me. But a lot of what happened with Disney was like a friend of mine said about an ignorant fraternity brother of his who succeeded in life: "He was a duck sitting on a pond. And they raised the level of the pond."

Eisner and Wells were brilliant in how they ran Disney. But the huge tail wind from videocassettes sales on all the old stuff that was there when they came in, that was an automatic break for the new management.

To be fair, they have been brilliant about creating new stuff - like *Pocahontas* and *The Lion King*  - to catch the same tailwind. But by the time it's done, *The Lion King* alone is going to do plural billions. And, by the way, when I say "When it's done", I mean fifty years from now or something. But plural billions - from one movie?

*Q: Could you talk about why you left the law?*

I had a huge family. Nancy and I supported eight children... And I didn't realize that the law was going to get as prosperous as it suddenly got. The big money came into law shortly after I left it. by 1962, I was mostly out. And I was totally out by 1965. So that was a long time ago.

Also, I preferred making the decisions and gambling my own money. I usually thought I knew better than the client anyway. So why should I have to do it his way? So partly, it was having an opinionated personality. And partly, it was a desire to get resources permitting independence.

Also, the bulk of my clients were terrific. But there were one or two I didn't enjoy. Plus, I like the independence of a capitalist. And I'd always had sort of a gambling personality. I like figuring things out and making bets. So I simply did what came naturally.

*Q: Do you ever gamble Las Vegas-style?*

I won't bet $100 against house odds between now and the grave. I don't do that. Why should I? I will gamble recreationally with my pals. And I'll occasionally play a much better bridge player, like Bob Hamman, who might be the best card player in the world. But I know I'm paying for the fun of playing with him. That's recreational.

As for gambling with simple mechanical house odds against me, why in the world would I ever want to do that - particularly given how I detest the manipulative culture of legalized gambling. So I don't like legalized gambling.

And I'm not comfortable in Las Vegas, even though it does now include a higher percentage of wholesome family recreation. I don't like to be with many of the types who hang around card parlors and so forth.

On the other hand, I do like the manly art of wagering, so to speak. And I like light social gambling among friends. But I do not like the professional gambling milieu.

*Q: Could you say something about how the mutual fund and money management business has changed since you got into  it - and the growth of capital markets?*

Actually, I didn't really get into it. I had the little private partnership for fourteen years - up until a little over twenty years ago. However, I never had enough money from other people to amount to a hill of beans - at least by current investment-management standards. So I've never really been part of the mutual fund business.

But the money management business has been one of the great growth businesses in the recent history of the United States. It's created many affluent professionals and multimillionaires. It's been a perfect gold mine for people who got in it early. the growth of pension funds, the value of American corporations, and the world's wealth have created a fabulous profession for many and carried lots of them up to affluence.

And we deal with them in a variety of ways. However, we haven't been part of it for many years. We've basically invested our own money for a long, long time.

*Q: Do you expect this bull run to continue?*

Well, I'd be amazed if the capitalized value of all American businesses weren't considerably higher twenty five years from now. And if people continue to trade with one another and shuffle these pieces of paper around, then money management may continue to be a marvelous business for the managers. But except for what might be called our own money, we're really not in it.

*Q: I was interested in the evolution of your investment strategy from when you first began - using the Ben Graham model - to the Berkshire Hathaway model. Would you recommend that model to a beginning investor - i.e, dumping most of it or all of it into one opportunity we think is a great one and leaving ti there for decades? Or is that strategy really for a more mature investor?*

Each person has to play the game given his own marginal utility considerations and in a way that takes into account his own psychology. If losses are going to make you miserable - and some losses are inevitable - you might be wise to utilize a very conservative pattern of investment and saving all your life. So you have to adapt your strategy to your own nature and your own talents. I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all investment strategy that I can give you.

Mine works for me. But, in part, that's because I'm good at taking losses. I can take 'em psychologically. And, besides, I have very few. The combination works fine.
