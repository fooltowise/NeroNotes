# A Lesson on Elementary, Worldly Wisdom, Revisited

## Stanford Law School
### April 19, 1996

What I'm going to try today is to extend the remarks I made two years ago at the USC Business School. You were assigned a transcript of my [[A Lesson on Elementary Worldly Wisdom| USC Talk]]. And there's nothing I said then that I wouldn't repeat today. But I want to amplify what I said then.

It's perfectly clear... that if Warren Buffett had never learned anything new after graduating from Columbia Business School, Berkshire would be a pale shadow of its present self. Warren would have gotten rich - because what he learned from Ben Graham at Columbia was enough to make anybody rich. But he wouldn't have the kind of enterprise Berkshire Hathaway is if he hadn't kept learning.

How do you get worldly wisdom? What system do you use to rise into the tiny top percentage of the world in terms of having sort of an elementary practical wisdom?

I've long believed that a certain system - which almost any intelligent person can learn - works way better than the systems that most people use. As I said at the USC School, what you need is a latticework of mental models in your head. And you hang your actual experience and you vicarious experience (that you get from reading and so forth) on this latticework of powerful models. And, with that system, things gradually get to fit together in a way that enhances cognition.

Your assigned reading for today included the latest annual letters from Jack Welch and Warren Buffett relating to General Electric and Berkshire Hathaway, respectively. Jack Welch has a PhD in engineering. And Warren plainly could have gotten a PhD in any field he wanted to pursue. And both gentlemen are inveterate teachers.

Worldly wisdom is quite academic when you get right down to it. Look at what General Electric has achieved - and, for that matter, what Berkshire Hathaway has achieved.

Of course, Warren had a professor/mentor - Ben Graham - for whom he had a great affection. Graham was so academic that when he graduated from Columbia, three different academic departments invited him into their PhD programs and asked him to start teaching immediately as part of the PhD program: those three departments being literature, Greek and Latin classics, and mathematics.

Graham had a very academic personality. I knew him. He was a lot like Adam Smith - very preoccupied, very brilliant. He even looked like an academic. And was a good one. And Graham, without ever really trying to maximize the gaining of wealth, died rich - even though he was always generous and spent thirty years teaching at Columbia and authored or coauthored the best textbooks in his field.

So I would argue that academia has a lot to teach about worldly wisdom and that the best academic values really work.

Of course, when I urge a multidisciplinary approach - that you've got to have the main models from a broad array of disciplines and you've got to use them all - I 'm really asking you to ignore jurisdictional boundaries.

And the world isn't organized that way. It discourages the jumping of jurisdictional boundaries. Big bureaucratic businesses discourage it. And, of course, academia itself discourages it. All I can say is that, in that respect, academia is horribly wrong and dysfunctional.

And some of the worst dysfunctions in businesses come from the fact that they balkanize reality into little individual departments with territoriality and turf protection and so forth. So if you want to be a good thinker, you must develop a mind that can jump the jurisdictional boundaries.

You don't have to know it all. Just take in the best big ideas from all these disciplines. And it's not that hard to do.

I might try and demonstrate that point by using the analogy of the card game of contract bridge. Suppose you want to be good at declarer play in contract bridge. Well, you know the contract - you know what you have to achieve. And you can count up the sure winners you have by laying down you high cards and your invincible trumps. 

But if you're a trick or two short, how are you going to get the other needed tricks? Well, there are only six or so different, standard methods. You've got long suit establishment. You've got finesses. You've got throw-in plays. You've got crossruffs. You've got squeezes. And you've got various ways of misleading the defense into making errors. So it's a very limited number of models.

But if you only know one or two of those models, then you're going to be a horse's patoot in declarer play.

Furthermore, these things interact. Therefore, you have to know how the models interact. Otherwise, you can't play the hand right.

Similarly, I've told you to think forward and backward. Well, great declarers in bridge think, "How can I take the necessary winners?" But they think it through backwards too. They also think, "What could possibly go wrong that could cause me to have too many losers?" And both methods of thinking are useful. So to win in the game of life, get the needed models into your head and think it through forward and backward. What works in bridge will work in life.

That contract bridge is so out of vogue in your generation is a tragedy. China is way smarter than we are about bridge. They're teaching bridge in grade school now. And God knows the Chinese do well enough when introduced to capitalist civilization. If we compete with a bunch of people that really know how to play bridge when our people don't, it'll be just one more disadvantage we don't need.

Since your academic structure, by and large, doesn't encourage minds jumping jurisdictional boundaries, you're at a disadvantage because, in that one sense, even though academia's very useful to you, you've been mistaught.

My solution for you is one that I got at a very early age from the nursery: the story of the Little Red Hen. The punchline, of course, is "Then I'll do it myself, said the Little Red Hen."

So if your professors won't give you an appropriate multidisciplinary approach - if each wants to overuse his own models and under-use the important models in other disciplines - you can correct that folly yourself. Just because he's a horse's patoot, you don't have to be one, too. You can reach out and grasp the model that better solves the overall problem. All you have to do is know it and develop the right mental habits.

And it's kind of fun to sit there and out-think people who are way smarter than you are because you've trained yourself to be more objective and multidisciplinary...

Furthermore, there's a lot of money in it - as I can testify from my own personal experience.

(*Charlie begins the Coca-Cola business case detailed in Talk Four, "Practical Thought about Practical Thought", and discusses the importance of flavor.*)


One of my favorite business stories comes from Hershey. They get their flavor because they make their cocoa butter in old stone grinders that they started with in 1800s in Pennsylvania. And a little bit of the husk of the cocoa bean winds up in the chocolate. Therefore, they get that odd flavor that people like in Hershey's chocolate.

Hershey knew enough when they wanted to expand into Canada to know they shouldn't change their winning flavor. Therefore, they copied their stone grinders. Well, it took them five years to duplicate their own flavor. As you can see, flavors can be quite tricky.

Even today, there's a company called International Flavors and Fragrances. It's the only company I know that does something on which you can't get a copyright or a patent, but which nevertheless receives a permanent royalty. They manage to do that by helping companies develop flavors and aromas in their trademarked products - like shaving cream. The slight aroma of shaving cream is very important to consumption. So all of this stuff is very important.

*(Continuing the Coca-Cola case study, Charlie explains how our understanding of graphic depictions of mathematical ideas are rooted in biology.)*

My friend, Dr. Nat Myhrvold, who's the chief technology officer at Microsoft, is bothered by this. He's a PhD physicist and knows a lot of math. And it disturbs him that biology could create a neural apparatus that could do automatic differential equations at fast speed - and, yet, everywhere he looks, people are total klutzes at dealing with ordinary probabilities and ordinary numbers.

By the way, I think Myhrvold is wrong to be amazed by that. The so-called fitness landscape of our ancestors forced them to know how to throw spears, run around, turn corners, and have you long before they had to think correctly like Myhrvold. So I don't think he should be so surprised. However, the difference is so extreme that I can understand how he finds it incongruous.

At any rate, mankind invented a system to cope with the fact that we are so intrinsically lousy at manipulating numbers. It's called the [[Graph]]. Oddly enough, it came out of the Middle Ages. And it's the only intellectual invention of the monks during the Middle Ages I know of that's worth a damn. **The graph puts numbers in a form that looks like motion.** So it's using some of this primitive stuff in your system in a way that helps you understand it. So the Value Line graphs are very useful. 

The graph I've distributed is on log paper - which is based on the natural tables of logarithms. And that's based on the elementary mathematics of [[Compound Interest]] - which is one of the most important models there is on earth. So there is a reason why that graph is in that form.

And if you draw a straight line through data points on a graph on log paper, it will tell you the rate at which compound interest is working for you. So these graphs are marvelously useful...

I don't use Value Line's predictions because our system works better for us than theirs - in fact, a lot better. But I can't imagine not having their graphs and their data. It's a marvelous, marvelous product...

*(Charlie discusses the importance of trademarks to Coca-Cola's success and carries it over to a discussion of food products and Carnation.)*

Now, when Carnation tried to make a deal for its [[Patent, Trademark, Exclusive Franchise| trademark]], there was this one guy who sold Carnation Fish. So help me God, that was his trade name. Don't ask me why. And every time they'd say, "We'll pay you $250'000", he'd say "I want $400'000." And then, four years later, they'd say "We'll give you $1'000'000." and he'd say "I want $2'000'000." And they just kept doing that all the way through. And they never did buy the trademark - at least, they hadn't bought it the last time I looked.

In the end, Carnation came to him sheepfacedly and said, "We'd like to put our quality control inspectors into your fish plants to make sure that your fish are perfect; and we'll pay all the costs" - which he quickly and smirkily allowed. So he got free quality control in his fish plants - courtesy of the Carnation Company.

The history shows the enormous incentive you create if you give a guy a trademark he can protect. And this incentive is very useful to the wide civilization. As you see, Carnation got so that it was protecting  products that it didn't even own.

That sort of outcome is very, very desirable for society. So there are some very fundamental microeconomic reasons why even communist countries should protect trademarks. They don't all do it, but there are very powerful reasons why they should. And, by and large, averaged out around the world, trademark protection's been pretty good.

*(Charlie applies various mental models to Coca-cola.)*

However, if you don't have the basic models and the basic mental models for dealing with the models, then all you can do is to sit there twiddling your thumbs as you look at the Value Line graph. But you don't have to twiddle your thumbs. You've got to learn one hundred models and a few mental tricks and keep doing it all of your life. It's not that hard.

And the beauty of it is that most people won't do it - partly because they've been miseducated. And I'm here trying to help you avoid some the perils that might otherwise result from that miseducation.

OK. We've been through some of the general ideas in the search for worldly wisdom. And now I want to turn to something even more extreme and peculiar than the talk I've already given you. Of all the models that people ought to have in useful form and don't, perhaps the most important lie in the area of psychology.

I recently had an instructive experience: I just returned from Hong Kong. I have a pal there who's a headmaster of one of the leading schools. He gave me the book called *The Language Instinct*, written by Steven Pinker. Well, Pinker is a semanticist professor who rose in the shadow of Noam Chomsky - Linguistics Institute Professor at MIT - who is probably the greatest semanticist who ever lived.

And Pinker says that human language ability is not just learned - it's deeply buried, to a considerable extent, in the genome. It's not in the genome of the other animals, including the chimpanzee, to any really useful extent. It's a gift that came to humans. And Pinker proves his point pretty well.

Of course, Chomsky's already proven it. You have to be pretty ignorant not to realize that a good deal of language ability is right there in the human genome. And even though you have to work like hell to improve it through education, you start with a big leg up in your genes.

Pinker can't understand why Chomsky - who, again, is such a genius - take the position that the jury's still out about why this ability is in the human genome. Pinker, in effect, says: "Like hell, the jury is still out! The language instinct got into humans exactly the same way that everything else got there - through Darwinian natural selection."

Well, the junior Professor is clearly right - and Chomsky's hesitation is a little daft.

But if the junior professor and I are right, how has a genius like Chomsky made an obvious misjudgment? The answer's quite clear to me - Chomsky is passionately ideological. He is an extreme egalitarian leftist who happens to be a genius. And he's so smart that he realized that if he concedes this particular Darwinian point, the implication threaten his leftist ideology. So he naturally has his conclusion affected by his ideological bias.

And that gets into another lesson in worldly wisdom : If [[Ideology]] can screw up the head of Chomsky, imagine what it does to people like you and me.

Heavy ideology is one of the most extreme distorters of human cognition. Look at these Islamic fundamentalists who just gunned down a bunch of Greek tourists shouting "God's work!"

Ideology does some strange things and distorts cognition terribly. If you get a lot of heavy ideology young - and then you start expressing it - you are really locking your brain into a very unfortunate pattern. And you are going to distort you general cognition.

That's a very interesting history if you take Warren Buffett as an example of worldly wisdom: Warren adored his father - who was a wonderful man. But Warren's father was a very heavy ideologue (right wing, it happened to be), who hung around with other very heavy ideologues (right wing, naturally).

Warren observed that as a kid. And he decided that ideology was dangerous - and that he was going to stay a long way away from it. And he has throughout his whole life. That has enormously helped the accuracy of his cognition.

I learned the same lesson in a different way. My father hated ideology. Therefore, all I had to do was imitate my father and, thereby, stay on what I regard as the right path. People like Dornan on the right or Nader on the left have obviously gone a little daft. They're extreme examples of what ideology will do to you - particularly violently expressed ideology. Since it pounds ideas in better than it convinces out, it's a very dangerous thing to do. 

Therefore, in a system of multiple models across multiple disciplines, I should add as an extra rule that you should be very wary of heavy ideology.

You can have heavy  ideology in favor of accuracy, diligence, and objectivity. But a heavy ideology that makes you absolutely sure that the minimum wage should be raised or that it shouldn't - and it's kind of a holy construct where you know you're right - makes you a bit nuts.

This is a very complicated system. And life is one damn relatedness after another. It's all right to think that, on balance, you suspect that civilization is better if it lowers the minimum wage or raises it. Either position is OK. But being totally sure on issues like that with a strong, violent ideology, in my opinion, turns you into a lousy thinker. So beware of ideology- based mental misfunctions.

*(Charlie laments how poorly the field of psychology deals with incentive-caused bias.)*

Another reason that I recommend Pinker, the semanticist who wrote the book that I told you about earlier, is that at the end of his book, he says (roughly) "I've read the psychology textbooks. And they're daft." He says, "This whole subject is misorganized and mistaught."

Well, I have far less in the way of qualifications than Pinker. In fact, I've never taken a single course in psychology. However, I've come to exactly the same conclusion - that the psychology texts. while they are wonderful in part, are also significantly daft.

In fact, just take simple psychological denial. About three centuries before the birth of Christ, Demosthenes said "What a man wishes, that also he will believe." Well, Demosthenes was right.
