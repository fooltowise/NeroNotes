# [[Factset]], [[London Stock Exchange]] and [[Refinitiv]]

## Market Infrastructure, Part 1

In the decade or so leading up to the mid-2000s, FactSet was in the business of aggregating third-party content from a variety of different vendors – financial information from Thomson Reuters; index data from MSCI, Russell, and S&P; trading data from exchanges – cleaning it up, hosting it on mainframes, and rendering it on workstations used by buy-side research analysts and portfolio managers (~80%-85% of annual subscription value) and investment banking analysts (if you worked as an investment banking analyst out of college, there’s a good chance you used FactSet to build models and comp tables).

On the back of its content business, FactSet wormed into Analytics…so in addition to running screens and looking up financial data, portfolio managers could upload their portfolios into FactSet and see how they deviated from their benchmarks in terms of factor tilts, P/E ratios, ROE, etc.; how much of their outperformance could be attributed to certain factors (momentum, value, vol); and how they might be expected to the perform under various stress scenarios[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-22742) 

As Analytics caught on, FactSet made smallish acquisitions to build out its first party proprietary content – earnings estimates (JCF), transcripts and events (CallStreet), news alerts (StreetAccount), and data related to equity ownership (LionShares) and M&A transactions (MergerStat).  By 2010, half of its employees were in India and the Philippines, collecting data from source filings. Today most of FactSet’s data is proprietary[<sup>2</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-22742).  More so than other content aggregators, FactSet scrubbed and normalized its datasets, ensuring that apples/apples comparisons could be made across companies, over time (back when I had access to both FactSet and Bloomberg, I’d use FactSet when the accuracy and consistency of company financials was of paramount importance and Bloomberg for just about everything else). After 2010, it also started delivering this data through feeds, directly to clients’ proprietary applications[<sup>3</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-22742).

Finally, with its acquisitions of Portware, CYMBA, and Vermilion in fy16 and ‘17 (ending August) – more was spent on acquisitions those 2 years than in the previous 10 – FactSet complemented its front-end solutions with automated trading and order management platform. 

So what was once a workstation that bundled 3<sup>rd</sup> party content has expanded into 1st party data, feeds, analytics, order management, and trade execution. These services can be consumed separately through APIs, but the hope is that asset managers will find it more useful to standardize their entire workflow on FactSet….i.e., an analyst or PM might draw on FactSet data to research a stock and place a trade through the FactSet’s order management system, where it is checked it for compliance, executed, and ultimately reflected in FactSet’s analytics and reporting software.  And all this stuff is now being repackaged and sold to wealth management firms[<sup>4</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-22742), where I expect FactSet will take share from Refinitiv, which has long been the industry’s basket case. 

In realizing scale economies in acquiring and distributing content and then surrounding that core content business with analytics and trade/order management, FactSet has come to look more like Bloomberg and Refinitiv, the leaders in the financial data/analytics space, with 33% and 23% market share, respectively.  But is that enough?  Bloomberg acquired Barclays’ index benchmarking business for $781mn in 2015 and now has [$725bn of ETF assets](https://www.ft.com/content/173460cb-4b27-4f9b-b7c2-2654111bdb65)[<sup>5</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-22742) benchmarked against its indices.  Refinitiv is about to be acquired by London Stock Exchange, owner of the FTSE Russell family of indices.  Capital IQ and SNL are part of S&P Global, which has majority ownership of the joint venture that owns the IP to the S&P and Dow Jones indices. 

These index businesses, which own widely adopted and effectively irreplaceable IP, provide a captive customer base for data aggregators to sell into and a channel to further productize data in the form of new indices….which, of course, leads me to wonder if FactSet might some day find itself part of a larger financial infrastructure complex, particularly as asset managers (85% of FactSet’s revenue), challenged by fee compression, consolidate their vendor relationships to realize cost savings and extract efficiencies.

But even without the insulating layer of index IP, FactSet seems to be doing pretty well.  It has grown organically every year since at least 2005 (high-single digit growth most years vs. 1%-2% for the industry as a whole), including in fy09, when it eked out 1% growth in the midst of severe industry pressure that dragged its client retention rate from 92% to 87% and its user base from 40k to 37k. 

FactSet’s success partly a consequence of product development and cross-selling.  Over the decades, FactSet has done a fine job layering one growth opportunity atop another, with Analytics carrying the baton as Workstation growth petered out, and now CTS and Wealth Management doing the same as Analytics starts to mature. 

It’s also a function of the company’s renowned service culture, which mandates that all salespeople and product developers spend 2-3 years servicing clients.  I’m reminded a bit of Jack Henry, which provides core processing infrastructure for banks with less than $50bn in assets and is also celebrated for its outstanding customer service.  The number of sub-$50bn commercial banks has been in decline since the 1970s, shrinking by close to 5%/year since 2012.  Jack Henry’s own customer base has declined by ~2%/year during that time.  And yet it continues to post high-single digit organic growth by leveraging its sticky core processing business to cross-sell other services that small/mid-sized banks and credit unions require to stay competitive with Tier 1 money centers. 

I can imagine a similar dynamic playing out at FactSet, where the number of clients declines a bit every year\[1\] but revenue still kind of chugs along at a mid/high single-digit pace as asset managers with the most scale survive and adopt more of FactSet’s solutions to stay cost competitive.  We can already see this happening, with ASV retention stable at ~95% even as client retention has fallen from 94% to 89% over the last 4.5 years.

By geography, low single digit growth in the US has been offset by high-single digit growth in Asia and Europe, where FactSet is still early and the active-to-passive shift isn’t as pronounced.  By product, flat growth in workstation users (across the industry, the terminal business is flat/declining) has been offset by high-single/low-double digit growth elsewhere. 

That said, it’s worth noting that even as FactSet has acquired more content and bolstered its end-to-end workflow proposition, organic growth has decelerated and EBITDA margins have declined….

![](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture1.png)

….which makes me think that new content and services are less a growth accelerant and more a customer retention tool with some upselling motions that allay secular headwinds.  Portfolio analytics was a natural cross-sell to equity managers already using FactSet’s data terminal, but it’ll be tougher to organically crossing into other adjacencies, which are dominated by other champions.  A strong position in equity analytics doesn’t also confer advantages in multi-asset class, where Aladdin (owned by BlackRock) and RiskMetrics (acquired by MSCI) have more substantial footprints.  Nor does it provide the muscle to claim significant share in trade execution and order management systems from [Bloomberg, the largest player with 38% share](https://www.thetradenews.com/bloomberg-maintains-dominance-oms-ems-space-analysis-finds/). 

Of course, absent FactSet’s superior customer service and focused execution, things could be much worse. 

Just ask Thomson Reuters. 

In 2006, Thomson Financial, the financial data and analytics segment of Thomson Reuters, was growing 5%-6% and contributed 30% of the revenue of its parent, Thomson Corp., who besides aggregating financial and trading data, also sold content related to higher education (Thomson Learning), tax & accounting, legal, and healthcare as part of its grand ambition to become a dominant purveyor of information for professionals in knowledge-based industries.  But in the realm of financial content, Thomson Financial – a distant number 3 player behind Bloomberg and Reuters – was not taken all that seriously.  Perhaps self-conscious of its diminutive stature, management sold its higher learning business for ~$8bn in 2007 and used the proceeds to partly fund its monumental $17bn 50/50 cash/stock acquisition of Reuters the following year. 

Reuters supplied real-time news, pricing, and FX trading systems, and catered mostly to sell-side dealers; Thomson Financial collected financial data, commanded a leading position in fixed income trading (via its ownership of TradeWeb), and sold to buy-side asset managers.  Combined, the two companies (which together comprised Thomson Reuters’ Financial & Risk segment) generated $8bn of revenue and commanded roughly the same 1/3 share as Bloomberg. 

At around the time it closed the Reuters deal, management projected $1.4bn of annual cost synergies on a combined EBITDA base of $3.7bn.  Supposedly, F&R was run-rating these cost savings by 4q10…though you wouldn’t know it by looking at the financials.  At both the company and F&R segment level, EBITDA margins went nowhere from 2008, when Reuters closed, to 2012, when these synergies should have been fully baked in.  One could argue that these cost savings were recycled into product development and productivity initiatives, except that organic revenue growth was flat/down over this period….and one could blame disappointing growth on the financial crisis and secular challenges, except that FactSet grew by high-single digits during the same period. 

No, when you looked past the excuses, it was clear that Thomson Reuters was a heaping mess.  They were so busy chasing billion-dollar deals[<sup>6</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-22742) that they forgot how to run an actual business.  F&R had over 400 separate products, many of which competed with each another, and the brick and mortar presence of a retailer, with employees spread over 500 offices.  Customer service was terrible and despite offering steep discounts to lure its legacy base of Reuters 3000Xtra terminal users to the latest Eikon workstation, TR still donated share to Bloomberg and FactSet.  

In late 2013, the new management team announced a major strategy overhaul.  Over the next 4 years, the company rationalized its product offerings, sold its non-core health business, consolidated technology across divisions, cut costs, swore off acquisitions, and committed itself to organic growth.  Inefficiencies lingered[<sup>7</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-22742) and customer experience scores were still weak, but organic growth was no longer negative[<sup>8</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-22742), margins had improved from 22% to 31%, and retention climbed its way back to 90%.

Maybe management decided then that while things weren’t perfect, enough progress had been made that it could divest F&R to focus on its faster growing Legal and Tax businesses without feeling it had left easy value on the table.  So in January 2018, Thomson Reuters agreed to sell 55% of F&R to Blackstone[<sup>9</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-9-22742), using ~$10bn of the $17bn of gross proceeds from the transaction to repurchase shares[<sup>10</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-10-22742). In November 2019, less than 2 years into owning it, Blackstone announced it was selling F&R (renamed Refinitiv) to London Stock Exchange Group for $27bn[<sup>11</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-11-22742) in an all share transaction that would leave Refinitiv shareholders owning 37% of the combined company (TR’s 45% ownership stake in Refinitiv will be replaced with 15% ownership of LSE).

Before going public in the ‘90s, many of the world’s stock exchanges were monopolies owned by governments and banks.  They had little incentive to invest in technology and charged fees that banks and broker-dealers deemed excessive, prompting pro-competition regulation like Europe’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) in 2007, which banned concentration rules that required stocks be traded on exchanges, ushering in Multilateral Trade Facilities (non-exchange trading platforms, equivalent to the Alternative Trading Systems that were gaining traction in the US at the same time) and dark pools[<sup>12</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-12-22742) (broker-owned entities like Chi-X Europe and Turquoise, who came to market with superior technology). 

Legacy exchanges didn’t take these new rivals seriously at first.  In 2006, LSE seemed blind to any technology deficits, trumpeting the arrival of TradElect, a cutting-edge trading platform that promised to quadruple capacity and cut trading latency by 10x.  When it was launched in 2007 after 4 years in development, TradElect was declared by management ”the most advanced trading platform of any exchange in the world”[<sup>13</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-13-22742).  LSE rejected Nasdaq’s acquisition overtures (twice)[<sup>14</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-14-22742) on that premise that the latter’s offer undervalued the burgeoning volumes that TradElect would soon accommodate. 

We now know that those claims were exaggerated.  The exchange suffered [4 separate outages in late 2008](https://web.archive.org/web/20131019184937/http:/www.securitiestechnologymonitor.com/reports/21_22/-24395-1.html) during punctuated spikes in trading volume, including on September 8 when TradElect was [down for 7 hours](https://web.archive.org/web/20131019184937/http:/www.securitiestechnologymonitor.com/reports/21_22/-24395-1.html)[<sup>15</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-15-22742).  In February 2009, CEO Clara Furse was replaced by ex-Lehman banker Xavier Rolet who admitted that TradElect, far from being the most advanced trading platform of any exchange in the world, was actually LSE’s “first and foremost problem”.  Not only did the trading engine fall short of management’s hype, but the technology behind it — outsourced to Accenture, who relied heavily on hardware and Microsoft’s .NET framework, resulting in 5x the servers to process the same volume as UNIX-based MTFs it — was far more expensive to implement than competing options.  This was a massive disadvantage in a scale-based enterprise where pennies matter, especially against a competitor like Chi-X, who not only had superior technology but far lower compliance costs, and was _still_ pricing unprofitably to grab volume. 

Equity exchanges were once widely considered unassailable businesses.  Buyers attracts sellers and vice versa, fueling winner-take-most outcomes that drive ever greater concentration of liquidity and narrower spreads, attracting even more buyers and sellers.  The legacy exchanges could not conceive of an upstart arresting network effects that had reified over centuries, so they ignored the MTFs and instead focused on each other. 

You may recall the mid-2000s as a period of rampant M&A speculation, which I discussed in [last year’s post on exchange operators](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/exchanges/).  By slashing redundant corporate overhead and aggregating trading flows of both venues on a shared base of technology, an acquiring exchange can realize savings that typically amount to 25%-40% of the target’s cost structure.  And cross-border M&A further allows the combined entity to generate fees by listing an issuer’s stock on multiple exchanges.  Moreover, since the exchange that lists the stock often also hosts most of the trading in the issuer’s shares, the exchange enjoys fees from secondary trading on those listed shares, which in turn generates real time pricing data that can be sold to Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters, etc. 

The emergence of ATSs in the US and MTFs in Europe demonstrated that the dominant monopoly positions that legacy exchanges enjoyed were as much a function of regulatory protection as scale economies.  When those protections were lifted in the mid-2000s and rival trading venues with superior technology, seeded with volumes from dealers, were allowed to compete, incumbent exchanges lost unimaginable share.  Within 2 years of launch, Chi-X Europe captured ~15%-20% of pan-European equity flows, [bested only by NYSE Euronext and rivaling LSE](https://www.ft.com/content/81064a1a-1654-11df-8d0f-00144feab49a).  LSE’s share of trading in UK blue chip stocks [collapsed from 96% at the start of 2008 to 54% by February 2010](https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/turquoise-allows-lse-growth-20100222).  In the US, where ATSs offered rebates to lure liquidity providers, non-exchange share of trading in NYSE listed stocks went from 17% in 1990 to 31% in 2015[<sup>16</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-16-22742).

While these upstart venues leveraged the latest technology to trade equities listed across Europe, LSE’s bloated TradElect engine could barely handle securities listed in the UK and Italy (LSE got into Italy through its 2007 all stock £1.1bn acquisition of Borsa Italiana, which it is now expected to sell to Euronext N.V. for €4.3bn[<sup>17</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-17-22742), conditional upon the European Commission requiring the divestiture to approve the Refinitiv deal). 

So LSE scrapped TradElect and brought IT in-house with the £18mn acquisition of trading systems vendor Millennium IT.  Though Millennium doesn’t get much attention compared to some of the bigger/splashier acquisitions that LSE has made, it is arguably among LSE’s most significant acquisitions, providing the foundational technology that would come to underpin LSE’s post-trading operations and all equity, derivatives, and fixed income trading across its trading venues. 

LSE also acquired majority ownership of Turquoise[<sup>18</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-18-22742) – a money losing MTF that had amassed ~3% share of lit equity trading across Europe since launching in September 2008 – following rival incumbents Deutsche Börse and Euronext, who went pan-European by acquiring or [launching](https://www.ft.com/content/a4f8f62a-7cf4-11dd-8d59-000077b07658) MTFs of their own.  Under LSE’s care, Turquoise tripled its market share and became profitable within 4 years.

But all this horizontal maneuvering didn’t change the fact that the moat around equity trading was eroding, perhaps for good.  LSE understood this.  Its Capital Markets business, which is mostly made up of equity trading and comprised nearly 70% of LSE’s total EBITDA in fy08, was under serious pressure.

![](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture2.png)

And so during the 2008-2012 period, as LSE focused on standard exchange activities like listing, trading, and horizontal expansion, it also began hinting at adjacent opportunities like post-trade services (clearing and settlement) and indices. 

And this is really where LSE’s value creation story begins.  LSE’s two largest businesses today – proprietary index IP (like the Russell 2000, against which futures, ETFs, and other products are created) and clearing – didn’t exist before 2012. 

When LSE acquired Borsa Italiana, the latter’s modest clearing and settlements segment (Monte Titoli and CC&G) was treated as a sideshow to Borsa’s exchange business.  But by 2013, when LSE acquired its majority stake in LCH.Clearnet[<sup>19</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-19-22742), a European clearing and settlements company, management’s priorities had flipped. 

One of the key value propositions that a clearinghouse offers is the ability for broker dealers to net out exposures.  Consider the following:

![](https://mk0scuttleblurbyijo5.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture3-1024x424.png)

Source: [Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2013/central-counterparties-what-are-they-why-do-they-matter-and-how-does-the-boe-supervise-them.pdf?la=en&hash=3D7AFAEA1E84FAAEC803D92D02BD069E8D5F4943).  _Central counterparties: what are they, why do they matter and how does the Bank supervise them?_

The illustration on the left shows bilateral trades between 3 banks (“non-cleared trades”); the diagram on the right shows those same trades intermediated by a centralized counterparty (CCP), who guarantees the amounts owed to both parties in any given transaction (so if Bank B collapsed and could not come up with the £6mn owed to Bank A, a CCP like LCH.Clearnet would be on the hook).  In a non-cleared regime, Bank A would report 2 separate transactions, a gross payable of £8mn and a gross receivable of £6mn.  By transacting through a CCP, those gross exposures are compressed to a single payment obligation of £2mn.  Banks like this, especially in a regulatory regime that enforces stricter capital and liquidity requirements, because it dramatically reduces contractual liquidity needs (since the CCP bears the risk of default) and leverage ratios (multiple gross exposures are whittled down to a single net). 

Under the open, horizontal model, clearinghouses like LCH and Euroclear cleared transactions from any exchange.  As non-profit entities the latter had little incentive to innovate or operate more efficiently.  They outsourced technology, which hindered the pace of product development and gave rise to bloated cost structures.  At the time it was acquired by LSE, LCH’s EBITDA margins were just 32%, well below the ~60% margins reported by Monte Titoli at the time Borsa Italia was acquired. 

Moreover, while these clearinghouse were horizontal and open in the sense that they closed transactions from any exchange, they were closed and vertical in that they cleared products within isolated silos, which made it difficult to cross-margin across different but correlated instruments and securities (for instance, German equities options couldn’t be netted against German cash equities to reduce net exposure).  In fact, clearinghouses had no incentive to allow cross-margining since doing so reduced margin requirements and therefore the collateral balances off which interest income was earned.  Rather than create value by luring non-cleared volumes with better services, they extracted monopolistic rents by overcollateralizing client obligations. 

Unlike LCH and Euroclear, major exchanges like ICE and Deutsche Borse tightly bundle trading and clearing, meaning if you trade derivatives on one of their exchanges, you must also clear those trades through one of their clearinghouses (in their financial statements, ICE and DB report revenue from trading and clearing as a single line-item/segment).  When MiFID 2’s Open Access rules are eventually implemented, everyone will be forced to unbundle.  European regulators hope that by introducing more competition, MiFID 2 will compel clearinghouse operators to invest in more technology, and introduce more transparency and choice for market participants, as MiFID 1 did with respect to exchanges.  None of this really effects LSE, who is already running open and unbundled (of course, this was a convenient position for LSE to adopt because it didn’t have much of a derivatives trading business and its cash equity revenues were faltering).    

As with an exchange, the value of a CCP for each participant grows as the number of clearing counterparties expands.  Just as more buyers and sellers lead to more liquidity and lower transaction prices at an exchange, more clearing participants gives rise to more offsetting obligations at a CCP.  ICE can’t see the part of an interest rate portfolio that a dealer clears at LCH and vice-versa, so by dispersing post-trade activities among 2 (or more) clearinghouses, a dealer is posting more margin than necessary.  It is far more capital efficient to concentrate clearing at a single CCP, with a comprehensive view of all possible offsetting exposures.  The ability to cancel out correlated exposures also drives the counterintuitive result that perhaps the best way to mitigate systemic risk may be to concentrate it among a few well-capitalized, systemically important CCPs.

But those benefits depend on concentration and therefore run counter to the goal of more competition.  Or to put it more precisely, by dismantling the artificial constraints of closed silos, MiFID 2 results in more competition, but market forces eventually lead to a winner-take-most outcome anyways.  While ICE and LSE argued on opposite sides of the open/closed debate, they both clearly saw concentration as a natural consequence of Open Access (ICE pointed to concentration as a reason why Open Access was really anti-competitive and should be stopped; LSE pitched concentration to shareholders as a feature that would solidify its moat).

Of course, Open Access doesn’t necessarily drive more share to legacy players with the largest installed bases.  After all, the network effects enjoyed by legacy exchanges were eroded by upstart MTFs wielding superior technology.  MiFID 1 led to fragmentation, not consolidation.  I think the lesson here is to treat scale advantages as an opportunity to reinvest in innovation rather than as an excuse not to.  Upon acquiring LCH, LSE, who had already experienced the downside of outsourcing technology and resting on legacy network effects, re-centered the clearinghouse’s technology on the internal platform built by Millennium and worked to break down the asset class siloes that hindered cross-margining.  LCH sacrificed interest income by launching new compression techniques that whittled away ever more notional exposure.

Here’s an example that might clarify this point.  Below is a reconciliation of notional outstanding exposure at LCH from the Jan 2014 to Apr 2015.  Added to the starting outstanding notional balance of $426tn is $817tn of notional cleared, which is offset by $531tn of notional exposure rolling off and $410tn of notional “compressed” (offset with other exposures).

![](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Picture4.png)

So even with $286tn of net notional cleared during this period ($817tn less $531tn), LCH’s notional outstanding balance still shrank by $124tn thanks to the company’s compression innovations.  Apparently, this was the first decline seen in over 15 years.  That it happened during a time when LCH experienced a record amount of cleared volumes makes the decline in notional outstanding all the more remarkable. (you can only take compression so far.  A CCP can cancel out structurally correlated exposures among members but doesn’t have the capital cushion to do something exotic like offset equities against rates or something). 

Regulatory pressure provided a tailwind to central clearing, but product innovation and the value-add it enabled has fueled LSE’s share gains.  LSE compressed $920tn of notional in 2019, more than double the amount from 2014, yielding $35bn of capital relief for clearing clients.  A decade ago, when OTC derivatives were a small part of LCH’s business (the company was better known for clearing European equities), some feared that OTC products would morph into futures as derivative exchanges launched OTC clearing and cross-margined futures against OTC, leaving nothing left for LCH (in 2015, LSE somewhat filled this gap, launching CurveGlobal, an IRD trading venue with 7 dealers[<sup>20</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-20-22742). CurveGlobal volumes grew nearly 80% last year, albeit off a small base). 

But that never happened.  Today, LCH’s interest rate swap clearing service, SwapClear, commands over 90% share of cleared volume – SwapClear’s revenue, including interest income, ballooned from €36mn in 2010 to €315mn in 2016 – and with SwapAgent, LCH is bringing the functional aspects of the CCP infrastructure, including compression, to the 25% of OTC rate derivatives market that goes uncleared[<sup>21</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-21-22742).  Dominance in interest rate derivatives (IRD) has made it easier to clear other kinds of the products.  Less than two years after launching CDS Clear, LCH claimed 1/3 of cleared euro denominated CDS volume, a market that at the time was ~100% dominated by ICE.  LCH has a near monopoly on non-deliverable FX forwards, plus the largest share of cleared European Repo and inflation swaps.

LCH’s revenue has compounded by 10% over the last 5-6 years on a ~tripling of OTC clearing revenue.  Through a combination of operating leverage and cost synergies[<sup>22</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-22-22742), margins have expanded from ~33% to 55%.  LCH now accounts for close to 20% of LSE’s EBITDA (pro-forma for Refinitiv).  It’s been a huge success. 

LCH was the first of several consequential moves that LSE would take to unlink its fortunes from exchanges.  In 2012, it acquired the 50% of FTSE that it didn’t already own for £450mn[<sup>23</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-23-22742).  A few years later, it took down another index provider, Russell Investments, for £1.6bn[<sup>24</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-24-22742).  Along with MSCI, FTSE owns some of the most widely referenced IP for non-US stocks.  The largest emerging markets ETF, Vanguard’s VWO ($60bn+ under management), tracks the FTSE Emerging Markets Index.  The Russell complex, meanwhile, offers benchmarks and indices for small/mid-cap US equities.

The combined FTSE Russell business gets ~60% of revenue from: 1/ selling historical and real-time index data – including the ROA, ROE, dividend yields, sectors, geography, float, trading volumes, corporate actions etc. pertaining to index constituents – on a subscription basis to (mostly) asset managers who benchmark to FTSE Russell indices and use this data for performance attribution, and 2/ licensing its benchmarks to exchanges (CBOE, for instance, pays LSE a fee for the exclusive right to offer options and futures trading against the Russell 2000 index).  The subscription component of FTSE Russell, S&P, and MSCI’s index businesses are fantastic growing annuities, with almost no incremental cost burden, 95%+ retention rates, and pricing power.

The other 40% comes from fees pegged to the AUM of ETFs and passive funds benchmarked to FTSE Russell indices.  FTSE Russell’s double digit growth – fueled by the ongoing shift to from active to passive management, factor-based investing, cross-sales of FTSE indices to Russell’s US clients and Russell indices to FTSE’s international clients, and a major win from Vanguard, who chose FTSE as the EM index benchmark for $170bn of AUM[<sup>25</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-25-22742) – breathed new life into LSE’s Information Services segment, which at the time was anchored by declining sales of real time data coming off the stagnating trading activity on its exchanges. 

One of the things you’ll often hear LSE’s management say is that while exchange volumes used to drive clearing, today the dynamic has flipped: to attract exchange liquidity, one must own or have exclusive rights to the IP of the thing being traded and the ability to efficiently clear it.  Clearing and IP have become the new critical points of integration.

To wit, CBOE’s exchange business draws most of its value from CBOE’s ownership of the VIX IP as well as exclusive long-term licensing agreements that permit options and futures trading on marquee indices like the S&P 500, Russell 2000, and Dow Jones.  ICE Brent futures contract pricing is the most widely referenced component of the Brent complex, against which 2/3 of the world’s traded crude is priced.  Despite MiFID’s fragmentary effects, as well as attempts by competing exchanges to break into the market (Nasdaq NFX, Shaghai International Energy Exchange), it dominates trading in energy derivatives.  Across a range of asset classes, exchange traded derivative flows tend to concentrate around benchmark indices. 

But it’s one thing to say that most of the profits that CBOE realizes comes from trading products wrapped in IP and another to draw the conclusion that the IP owner holds a dominant bargaining position vs. exchanges.  I mean if that were the case then LSE, by owning the IP to the Russell and the FTSE, could presumably own all the derivatives and options trading of derivatives pegged to that IP.  They’ve tried, but no.  Despite its near monopoly clearing OTC rates and owning some valuable index IP, LSE has a paltry presence in derivatives trading.  CME and CBOE are the go-to venues for trading major branded index options and futures. LSE’s exchange business has historically been biased towards cash equities and kind of sucky. So we have a set of oligopolistic players operating in different parts of the value chain, neither wielding enough power over the other to bother fussing with what are already very good economics. 

And that’s not only fine, but consistent with LSE’s strategy.  When you think about each of the major exchange operators, there is typically one or two consistent salient asset or geographic “themes” embedded across trading, clearing, and data services: rates and energy futures for ICE; rates and commodity futures for CME; US equities for NASDAQ…which makes sense when you consider that most exchanges have historically operated as closed, vertically integrated silos.  But LSE isn’t really structured like that.  They are vertically integrated, but with clearing heavily concentrated in OTC derivatives, trading biased towards cash equities, and indices exposed to both emerging markets and US equities, they don’t insist on thematic consistency.  This isn’t sloppy strategy and empire building but rather LSE assuming an adamantly open and modular position to best adapt to the forces of consolidation creeping over the industry. 

Dealers, pressured by onerous capital and liquidity constraints, are seeking balance sheet relief.  Asset managers are becoming fewer and bigger and want access to multiple asset classes globally.  These realities have compelled LSE to diversify and consolidate, building a clearinghouse footprint that mirrors the global presence of its dealers and IP that offers exposure across asset classes and geographies (LSE’s management believes that financial infrastructure will eventually be concentrated in the hands of 2 or 3 $50bn market players with global reach).  LSE might prefer to dominate all asset classes and geographies across IP, exchanges, and clearing, but the reason it vertically integrates has less to with controlling the stack and extracting rents than with providing its clients with options.  Under this open/modular setup, LSE discerns partnership where a closed exchange might see competition.  It clears for CBOE Europe Equities and Euronext, and licenses its indices to CME and CBOE; some customers of LCH (clearing), Turquoise (MTF), CurveGlobal (IRD derivatives trading), and MTS (electronic fixed income trading) are also minority shareholders who help set governance. 

It’s getting harder for exchanges, clearinghouses, and IP and content/analytics vendors – the core pieces of financial markets infrastructure – to remain niche when the asset managers they serve are consolidating and broadening.  At first, integration across the infrastructure space ran horizontal.  But over time, exchanges fused with clearinghouses, then index IP, and now data aggregation and delivery.   

Thus, the consolidation logic that fueled so much exchange/clearinghouse/data M&A has culminated in LSE’s monster acquisition of Refinitiv.

Besides revenue synergies from cross-selling opportunities Refinitiv pricing and reference data to LSE’s index customers and index/analytics products to Refinitiv’s, the acquisition adds scale and relevance to areas where LSE is has historically been a bit player.  LSE wholesales real time data from trading activity on its own exchanges; Refinitiv aggregates and re-sells real-time data feeds from major exchanges across the globe.  Reuters supplements LSE’s obscure Regulatory News Service (RNS). Tradeweb, where Refinitiv has 54% economic share, resuscitates LSE’s flagging fixed income trading effort just as Refinitiv’s ~£3bn of content and analytics revenue lends relevance to LSE’s $260mn data business.  Moreover, proprietary and third party content – including FX and fixed income pricing, earnings estimates, and company financials from 150k data sources – can be used to construct different kinds of indices, particularly those pertaining to fixed income and ESG[<sup>26</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-26-22742) (both are very hot right areas now). 

The reported synergies are relatively modest as a proportion of Refinitiv’s costs and revenue, though they will most likely be ratcheted higher post-close and are meaningful enough on an absolute basis to bring the purchase multiple down to just under 12x EBITDA (ex. revenue synergies), which seems like reasonable valuation for a mature but moated cash cow that _might_ return to high-single digit organic growth under a new owner… though this is in part a bet a new management team that had nothing to do with the value creation at LSE over the last decade[<sup>27</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/lse_fds/#easy-footnote-bottom-27-22742).

Capital Markets was a great business before MiFID 1 opened the door to competition.  In 2009, it represented the near entirety of LSE; today, it is the least important value driver.  Refinitiv, which will comprise 2/3 of LSE’s combined revenue, could be a solid business under the proper guidance, but I mostly see it as a stagnant cash cow.  If FactSet, a well-run company with mid-single digit market share can only manage to generate high-single digit growth, Refinitiv, a stodgy lumbering giant who already commands 1/3 of the market, will probably do less than that. 

LCH is an excellent business with strong network effects and the most systemically important of LSE’s businesses.  Even with a low and placid rate environment that hasn’t been conducive to the uncertainty that drives swap activity, LCH has still grown its OTC rate clearing volumes by double digits most years.  There are some other largely untapped growth pockets like SwapAgent, repo, inflation swaps, FX, and who knows what else…but given how dominant LCH already is in rate swaps, it’s probably prudent to fade growth down to high single digits over the next 5 years.  LCH margins should continue to expand thanks to operating leverage and a continuing mix shift to higher margin buy-side clients who pay on a per-transaction basis (as opposed to sell-side member institutions, who pay more of a flat fee).

Management thinks it can accelerate Refinitiv’s growth to 5%-7%.  That seems ambitious – the last time Refinitiv generated 5% growth was in 2007, when conditions were far more favorable – but new management, new synergies….sure, let’s go 5%.  With Capital Markets growing lsd and Information Services (Index biz + real time data) growing hsd, consolidated growth rate probably blends out to mid-single digits.  So at ~30x+ cash earnings (pro-forma for Refinitiv), LSE trades roughly in line with moaty data and benchmark businesses like MCO and SPGI.
