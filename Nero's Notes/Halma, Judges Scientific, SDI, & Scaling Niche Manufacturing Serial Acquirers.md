# [[Halma]], [[Judges Scientific]], [[SDI Group]], & Scaling Niche Manufacturing Serial Acquirers

Published on **October 17, 2022**

Halma is a best-in-class serial acquirer for niche manufacturing businesses. [In 1972, David Barber](https://www.halma.com/~/media/Files/H/Halma/Corp/documents/david-barber-halma-strategy-speech.pdf) founded the company with a clear set of principles to grow by acquisition:

1.  Use internally generated cash, not equity
2.  Buy similar businesses that you already own
3.  Focus on bolt-ons or quasi-bolt-ons, rarely move into new areas

Since then, HLMA has compounded EBIT 15.3% and dividend per share ~4% for almost 50 years.

[We recently interviewed the CEO of SDI Group](https://inpractise.com/articles/sdi-group-niche-manufacturing-serial-acquirer), potentially a smaller version of HLMA, and this comment particularly stuck out:

> Halma was the first business I looked at. Halma started exactly the same as us and the same as David did in the 1980s…They started getting bigger and bigger, buying bigger businesses. Then they started putting divisions and then managers and CEOs over the divisions. That is a structure that you do – I’m sure we will do it and David will do it – as you grow the businesses. What you don’t want to do is put a structure in place, at head office – which I’ve seen many times – where you say, now we’re going to buy the business; it kills it. These businesses run autonomously. - [CEO of SDI Group](https://inpractise.com/articles/sdi-group-niche-manufacturing-serial-acquirer)

This organizational ‘structure’ that HLMA added in the 1980’s was pivotal to scale beyond owning ~25 companies. The bigger the revenue base, the harder it is for acquirers to grow inorganically.

Over the next 5 years, SDI and [[Judges Scientific]] will either need to acquire, merge and integrate more assets (Halma), acquire more smaller companies (CSU), or acquire bigger companies and run them better (DHR).

Today, SDI and JDG typically buy companies with £1-2m EBIT for a ~5x multiple. Post-acquisition, each business is treated as a standalone profit center.

**Both companies will face a similar challenge as HLMA in the 1980’s: how do we structure the business to continue to grow ~10% inorganically?**

We dug through Halma’s filings dating back to 1976. In this analysis, we explore the challenges Halma faced at a similar size to JDG today and the potential solutions to scaling a niche manufacturing acquisition machine.

Defining serial acquirers can be murky. Companies like Constellation Software acquire VMS businesses and make no changes post-acquisition. Danaher or Lifco will cluster, integrate, or often merge portfolio companies.

There is no right or wrong way. And it often depends on the strategy and ability to integrate assets.

JDG and SDI are closer to CSU’s model, and Halma closer to Danaher. From the beginning, Halma was merging and integrating portfolio companies. For example, this was from the 1983 annual report:

HLMA would consistently buy and spin-off or merge its portfolio companies together. This ensured the number of subsidiaries was manageable. From 1978-86, HLMA consistently had between 17-22 operating companies yet revenue tripled.

[This dates back to Barber’s original philosophy](https://www.halma.com/~/media/Files/H/Halma/Corp/documents/david-barber-halma-strategy-speech.pdf) in only focusing on bolt-ons or quasi-bolt-ons. Barber argues that simultaneously adding new companies and rationalizing the portfolio continually upgrades the technical strength and dominance of its products.

> “It is interesting to note that despite the Group’s systematic and continuous acquisition programme over the past decade, the number of operating companies within the group has risen very gradually. This is because the acquisition process is accompanied by a parallel programme of rationalization. The overall effect of this combined activity, in addition to its cash generating tendency, has been a progressive and continuing upgrading of the technical strength, sophistication, and market dominance of the Group’s portfolio products’’ - **David Barber, 1989 HLMA Annual Report**

JDG and SDI will also share facilities and integrate when it makes sense, but it’s not a core strategy like HLMA. JDG and SDI also operate more specifically in scientific instrumentation products which seem to have many different end markets. This makes it difficult to share manufacturing assets, IP, or sales distribution across subsidiaries.

In the early 80’s HLMA faced an operational challenge scaling beyond ~25 companies and ~£100m in revenue. In 1981, HLMA made a pivotal change: it added four divisions each under the control of a Divisional CEO. Instead of each individual company being a profit center, each Division became its own profit center.

In 1983, HLMA went one step further and delegated M&A responsibilities to the Divisional CEO. By 1985, HLMA had 5 divisional CEO’s with full responsibility of capital allocation and their own divisional P&L. This truly unlocked the potential scalability of HLMA’s model.

From 1978-83, HLMA’s revenue grew 12% per year. For the 5 years after the org structure change, HLMA grew revenue 26% per year. HLMA even acquired 8 companies in 1987.

HLMA’s structure is very different to Judges and SDI. Both Cicurel and Creedon individually allocate the capital; no-one else has M&A responsibility. This model has enabled JDG to grow quicker than HLMA for the first 17 years of its life:

But eventually, with only one person allocating capital to standalone units, there are limitations to scale.

At ~£150m revenue, we believe M&A has to be pushed down the ranks to grow double digit inorganically. This is what Leonard seems to have solved at CSU and is a main reason why it’s on a run-rate of 100+ acquisitions per year.

[Last year, we discussed the differences scaling acquisitions of VMS over niche manufacturing assets for scaling acquisitions:](https://inpractise.com/articles/halma-danaher-csu-and-serial-acquirer-org-structures)

> Halma owns a gas detection business selling portable monitors to oil and gas customers and a cardiovascular business for ambulatory blood pressure monitors. The range of expertise and knowledge of technical products, customers, and end markets makes it very difficult for opcos to stay ahead of the curve without an experienced opco CEO with full P&L ownership. On the other hand, Vertical Market Software businesses are not only higher quality companies, but also seem easier to manage and understand. This lends itself to a higher velocity of acquisitions. - [IP Analysis](https://inpractise.com/articles/halma-danaher-csu-and-serial-acquirer-org-structures)

Software benefits from tighter customer feedback loops, higher recurring revenue, and higher intangible assets that are somewhat easier to integrate and merge compared to physical assets.

> David and I are buying manufacturing sites. We buy raw materials and make them into widgets, tangible assets. That is the difference, for us. We’re buying bricks and mortar; these other guys are not. - [CEO of SDI Group](https://inpractise.com/articles/sdi-group-niche-manufacturing-serial-acquirer)

Arguably, JDG and SDI portfolio companies are more niche and across more end markets than Halma. This could make it even more difficult to increase the volume of smaller acquisitions.

Halma clusters assets in end markets with structural growth. It now has ~50 operating companies with 3 sectors and 12 divisions. They’ve added more layers of management but maintained P&L and M&A responsibility at the Division level.

Over the next few years, as SDI and JDG surpass 25 operating companies and reach over £100m revenue, they will face the ‘human problem’ of scaling M&A: to delegate M&A, the very core of its business, down the organisation.

There are two potential strategies to follow: put simply, replicate CSU or replicate HLMA.

CSU delegates down to Divisional CEO’s but keeps the VMS businesses standalone. HLMA delegates to Divisional CEO’s but integrates, merges, and drives more synergies post-acquisition.

Creedon suggests above that both companies will likely follow HLMA. For Judges, with a Former Halma boss as COO, this seems to be the next strategic move within 5 years.

This is a significant cultural and operational change. In the early 2000’s, HLMA faced huge challenges irrespective of the 20+ years experience merging and integrating subsidiaries.

From 1985-90, after shifting to 5 Divisional structures, HLMA’s revenue growth accelerated to 25% compared to only 12% CAGR from 1980-85. By 2003, revenue growth was declining and HLMA’s stock was cut in half over the next 3 years.

In the decade to 2000, HLMA had rapidly expanded from 30 to 45 companies. Divisional CEO’s weren’t trained and capital was misallocated. During the 90’s tech boom, Halma entered fast-growing, commoditised sectors like high power electrical resistors used in telecom infrastructure and auto / locomotive components. By 2003, the resistors sector revenue was declining 15%, the portfolio had zero pricing power, and it was a race to the bottom.

In 2005, a young 38-year old Divisional CEO called Andrew Williams took the helm. He spun out the resistors portfolio at a loss and focused on various strategic initiatives:

![Source: HLMA Annual Report, 2005](https://ip-media-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/187e2a4b-02e3-4d57-b647-a3d5cc769824/Screenshot%202022-10-18%20at%2000.41.35.png "Source: HLMA Annual Report, 2005")Source: HLMA Annual Report, 2005

Williams honed the focus on structurally growing sectors like Health, Infrastructure and Industrial Safety and sold assets that weren’t market leaders. He shifted from 6 to 3 divisions and reduced the end-market coverage per Divisional CEO to deepen expertise. Each Divisional CEO went through a leadership programme centered on capital allocation and organic growth. Williams also added leverage to the balance sheet and deepened its US sales distribution network.

**As companies push M&A responsibility closer to the frontline, it adds another layer of risk in the misallocation of capital. This is the major limitation of growth and the biggest risk to decaying returns for serial acquirers like JDG and SDI.**

Although HLMA didn’t grow from 2002-05, the company still earned ~£70m in FCF before acquisitions and EBIT margins were consistently 18-20%. The stability in gross and EBIT margins and the high ROCE provides a strong foundation in any downturn.

The stability of HLMA’s EBIT margin over 40 years is incredible. I guess this is what consistently buying companies at 40-50% ROCE gets you!

Whether the operating model is closer to Danaher or CSU, acquiring niche manufacturing assets is a great model. However, it’s clear there are some real human limitations to double-digit inorganic growth from ~£150m revenue or ~25 companies.

HLMA faced this in the 90’s and ended up restructuring the business. JDG could face this challenge soon as it reaches 25 companies and nearly £150m in revenue. However, JDG is still small enough to have a low hurdle to grow ~10% per year, albeit lower than the average 25% revenue growth since IPO.

We estimate JDG’s FY22 EBIT at ~£20m. To hit the 7% inorganic revenue growth target, JDG only needs to acquire £1.5-2m in EBIT per year. Add 3% organic growth and JDG can grow 10% per year, without additional leverage, by only acquiring 1-2 companies until 2030. At sub £70, this yields 11-12% IRR including dividends.

SDI trades at half the multiple of JDG with a longer runway. It’s a third of JDG market cap and has built a portfolio of 15 assets in half the time of JDG. Some argue this is because David is more frugal and focuses on the high-end of the market. Or maybe Mike is a better deal-maker?

Both are quality businesses that earn 20%+ ROIC and 45%+ return on tangible assets. The question is for how long can they grow? This will depend on solving the exact problems Halma faced over 30 years ago.
