# Niches
An Ecosystem is comprised of niches, and we can think of them as roles to be filled. There is a trade-off between specialization - dominating a smaller niche - and generalization, occupying a larger niche.

Specialists have less competition and stress, **but only in times of stability**. Generalists face a greater day-to-day challenge for resources and survival bit have more flexibility to respond when time changes.
