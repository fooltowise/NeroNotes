An "Established 1958" shopkeeper is at a point where the loss of his reputation will be far more costly than whatever he might gain by refusing to honour our exchange, which allows me to derive trust in the context in which the exchange takes place.  Upfront investment is proof of long-term commitment, which is a guarantor of honest behaviour. Reputation is a form of skin on the game: it takes far longer to acquire a reputation than to lose one.
