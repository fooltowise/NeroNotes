###### Recording revenue before completing material obligations under the contract

- Watch out for boomerang transactions: cash flowing back and forth  between a customer and seller raise questions wether the revenue might have been recorded too early
- Calendar games: be wary of  companies who extend their quarter-end date (ex: late transactions recorded on the "37th of december...")
- Changing accounting policies to keep the streak alive: ex - Keuring recognized first sales upon delivery, then later upon shipment

##### Recording revenue far in excess of work completed on the contract

- Watch for a change in revenue recignition policy to hide collapsing business: **especially when the new policy is percentage-of-completion(POC)**
- Watch for changing estimates when using POC accounting:  proportion of progress is left to the appreciation of management and can be changed on a whim
- Be alert for upfront recognition of a long-term license contract

##### Recording revenue before the buyer's  final acceptance of the product

- Seller record revenue before shipment: watch especially **bill-and-hold transactions**
- Seller record revenue upon shipment to someone other than the customer
  - Watch for shipping product to an internediary rather than the actual customer
  - Be wary of consignment arrangements ("consignment sales")
  - Who is the actual customer, the distributor or the end user? **Watch out for change to sell-in approach (i.e to the distributor) from a sell through approach (i.e to the end-user, more conservative) **
- Seller records revenue, but buyer can still reject the sale
  - Be wary of sellers deliberately shipping incorrect or incomplete products (ex: beta version of a software)
  - be alert to sellers shipping product before the agreed upon shipping date (especially if the retailer is overstocked)
  - be mindful of sellers recording revenue before the lapse of the right of return

##### Recording revenue when the buyer's payment remains uncertain or unnecessary

- buyer lacks the ability or the necessary approval to pay (ex: sale is contingent to outside funding)
- Watch for companies that change their assessment of customer's ability to pay (one-off boost to accounts receivables)
- Seller induces sale by allowing an exceptionally long time to pay
- **Watch for seller-provided financing**
- **Watch for companies that offer extended or flexible payment terms**
- **Sound the alarm when new extended payment terms are disclosed and DSO (day sales outstanding) jumps**
