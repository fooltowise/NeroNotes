# Norms and Incentives
Robert Axelrod found that in most situations, people have no incentive to punish cheaters. But he found that his model can be made to work in favor of the good guys with one simple addition: *a norm of punishing anyone who doesn't punish others.* Not standing up to a cheater is itself a punishable act.

When everyone is watching and judging everyone else, both for their individual behaviors and their efforts to punish cheaters, [[norms]] and their enforcement become viable enterprises.

Reputation is also a possible incentive. It's rarely in people's best interests to stick out their necks to punish transgressors. but throw some reputation into the mix and it can become profitable. Someone who helps evicting a cheater will be celebrated for his leadership.
