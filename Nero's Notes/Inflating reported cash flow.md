# Inflating reported cash flows

### Inheriting operating inflows in a normal business acquisition

- There is an accounting loophole that enables acquisitive companies to show strong CFFO growth every quarter simply because they are acquiring other businesses. If you buy the company with cash, the payment is recorded as an *investing outflow.* On the other hand, the operating cash flows of the target are added to the CFFO of the company. In an acquisition context, cash outflows never hit the operating section, yet all the inflows do.
- Serial acquirers receive this CFFO boost repeatedly, so treat CFFO differently for acquisitive companies, and look carefully at free cash flows!

### Acquiring contracts or customers rather than developing them internally

### Boosting CFFO by creatively structuring the sale of a business

- Recording CFFO for proceeds from the sale  of a business
- Watch for new categories on the statement of cash flows.
- Sell the business, but keep some of the good stuff (in particular receivables, so we can continue to collect them)
- Buy the business, but not any of the bad stuff (especially account payables)
- Buy controlling interest in a business, but use restricted cash to hide outflows
