### What is an investment edge?

**An edge is a repeatable sourcing of variant perception that leads to sustained outperformance.**

### Sources of variant perceptions:
- Informational (not happening now, most of it is insider trading and illegal)
- Analytical: You have an insight (See [[Two modes of investment idea generation]]) that other analysts missed
- Structural: Some institutionals cannot invest in very small capitalisations. They also have stakeholders with a short-term horizon
- Behavioral: it really exists, but very hard/impossible to implement in practice. It is very likely that you will have the same behavioral biases as the rest of the market.
