# Scuttleblurb again on Copart



When a car gets into accident, an insurer must decide whether to repair it or cut a check to the claimant for the pre-accident value and recoup whatever it can by sending the car to a salvage auction. In the US, that salvage auction is most likely operated by Copart or IAA, who each handle ~2mn of the 5mn cars assigned to auction every year. If the pre-accident value of a car is $10,000 and it costs $7,000 to repair it, the insurer will send the car to auction if they think they can recover more than $3,000 by doing so. So instead of shelling out $7,000 to a body shop, an insurer will pay the claimant $10,000 and sell the car in auction for, say, $4,000 (after auction fees), leaving them better off by $1,000…they are out of pocket $6,000 in the auction scenario ($10,000 paid to claimant minus $4,000 recovered in auction) vs. $7,000 in the repair scenario. The pre-accident value of the car might be so low that it’s not worth fixing at all. If it takes $5,000 of repairs to get a vehicle to its PAV of $5,000, well, screw it, you’re just going to pay the claimant $5,000 and recoup what you can for the damaged car in auction.

In my Copart post from 2018, I showed the following exhibit:

If I stretched the left and right sides of the time series, you’d see that the total loss % was just 4% in the 1980s and more than 20% today.

One reason total loss rates are trending higher is because Americans are holding on to their vehicles longer. According to IHS Markit, the [average age of a car on US road](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/28/cars-on-american-roads-keep-getting-older.html#:~:text=The%20average%20age%20of%20vehicles,average%20age%20was%209.6%20years.)s has risen from 9.6 years in 2002 to 12.1 years today. Because older vehicles are worth less than newer vehicles, they are more likely to be auctioned in the event of an accident.

But also, all else equal, the higher the repair costs the more it makes sense for an insurer to deem the car a “total loss” and send it to auction. And repair costs have trended relentlessly higher because:

1) body shops have consolidated into multi-shop operators (MSOs), who now handle 45% of repair volume, up from just 10% in 2000. These rolled-up entities have more market power to charge higher prices for their work and pass on the cost inflation they’re now experiencing from labor and parts shortages. Not only has the cost per hour of work gone up, but so has the number of hours required to turn a car around. Repair times are longer and the car depreciates in value for every day that passes, eroding the proceeds that could otherwise be realized in auction.

; and

2) cars are far more sophisticated today than they were 10 years ago, with sensors, chips, aluminum and safety features making them more expensive to repair.

Beside total loss rates, the other two drivers of auction volume are miles driven and accident frequency. Miles driven is self-explanatory. More miles = more accidents. The contribution from accident frequency is a bit more ambiguous. New safety features – lane keeping, adaptive cruise control, Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) – should reduce the number of accidents per mile, though it’s possible that some of this benefit is diluted by drivers being lulled into complacent driving. Also, the proliferation of smartphones has led to more distracted driving. Here’s some data from the US Department of Transportation:

![](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cprtx2.png)

You’ll notice that around 2010, after a few decades of decline, crashes per 100mn vehicle-miles moved higher for the next 8-9 years. I think that’s smartphones. But the long-term trend is probably lower, with enhanced safety features on cars and voice activated search and texting on smartphones more than offsetting distracted and complacent driving.

The number of miles driven should ~[track population growth](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/travel_monitoring/22febtvt/22febtvt.pdf) (1%/year) but I’m thinking all of this (and then some) is going to be offset by declining accident frequency, which leaves the unabated rise in loss rates fueling ~mid-single digit salvage volume growth over the next 5-10 years. By comparison, in 2016 management estimated the size of the US total loss market growing by 8%-10% and in the 4 years through Fall 2018, Copart’s volumes averaged ~11%. But this includes an assist from distracted driving that may not hold. Since 2018, including the mid-teens y/y declines during COVID, volumes appear to have grown by ~5%/year.

If and when it comes, widespread autonomous driving will seriously impair salvage volumes. But the technical barriers seem more formidable than many thought in 2015-2017, when this was front and center for anyone following autos. Can you get self-driving by iterating on narrow AI or does it require another conceptual leap? And how early is too early to worry about certain risks? Brain-machine interfaces may eventually render Google’s search enterprise obsolete, but you don’t want to take that threat so seriously today that it causes you to dismiss the higher probability scenario of Google remaining a relevant, highly monetizing search utility over the next decade. That’s sort of how I think about the impact of AVs on accident volumes, especially since AV adoption isn’t a cliff risk. We won’t wake up one morning to find Waymo’s everywhere and Copart’s stock down 80% as a result. I get the rudimentary idea that the stocks reflect risk ahead of their occurrence, but if you push the logic of obsolescence too far, almost nothing is investable except maybe cement companies. The first AV drove on a public highway 35 years ago in Munich. Extrapolating that initial success and avoiding an investment in Copart as a result would have been a disastrous error of omission. Taking obsolescence risk seriously can seem prudent and forward thinking, but taking it too seriously too early can be an even bigger mistake. Acceptance will be a gradual process, with regulations and consumer habits adapting alongside it. Rather than be deployed in shock-and-all fashion, self-driving vehicles might first be ubiquitously adopted in communities with wide roads, sparse traffic, and cooperative weather, conditions in which accidents are limited anyways. And as the world maybe progresses to that possible evolutionary endpoint, we will first see more widespread electric vehicle adoption, which because of their high tech and materials content, as well as the specialized labor required to repair them are, according to Copart’s management, being scrapped at higher rates and selling at much higher prices. EVs are still just 1% of auction volumes so it may be too early to draw any firm conclusions, but if Copart’s early observations are broadly applicable, it seems misguided to privilege a distant nebulous risk (autonomous vehicles) over a far more certain benefit (electric vehicles), especially when the former is something you will see coming far in advance.

So that’s “Q”. “P” consists of buyer and seller fees, which vary according to the type of seller and the sales price of the car. On the seller side, around 80% of volumes assigned to Copart and IAA come from insurance companies, the remaining 20% from fleet operators, independent used car dealers, charities, and finance companies. Insurance companies will typically have multi-year agreements with regional exclusivity and negotiated fees. When you add up Copart’s 1%-2% sales fee, the assignment fee, plus optional fees for extensive photographs and vehicle descriptions, it looks like insurers are paying somewhere between ~$120 to $200 per car. Used car dealers, who I estimate account for less than 10% of Copart’s assigned volume and auction through Copart Dealer Services, will pay anywhere between $135 and $235 per car[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/cprt1/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-34080).

The buyer side consists of vehicle dismantlers like LKQ, who sell used vehicle parts to body shops and scrap iron to recycling centers, and rebuilders, used vehicle dealers, exporters, and consumer car enthusiasts. Copart charges a whole slew of mandatory and optional buyer fees, including a Gate Fee to move the car from a Copart storage location to a buyer loading area, third party financing fees for those who finance purchases through Copart-brokered third party fincos, and even an internet fee for online bids. But by far the most significant source of revenue comes from bidding fees, which are tied to realized sales price, like so (sales prices on the left, bidding fees on the right):

That the largest source of fee income is linked to the sales price of vehicles points to an important secondary benefit of technology-loaded cars. Thirty years ago, the damaged cars assigned to auction were typically wrecks that sold at low price points. These days, even relatively minor front and rear end impacts that damage ADAS, LIDAR, cameras, and sensors are more likely to be deemed a total loss because repairing and re-calibrating this stuff is so damn expensive, which tilts auction volume mix toward newer, higher priced cars every year, resulting in more revenue per car for Copart and IAA.

What an average car sells for at auction varies by location. I’ve heard anywhere between ~$3,400 and $7,000 from former yard managers….let’s just say $5,000. Copart realizes ~$900 to $1,000 of service fees per auctioned vehicle, so maybe we’re talking ~20% “take rates”. Based on Copart’s bidding fee schedule, we can infer that around 80% of those fees comes from buyers. This makes sense considering that on the sell-side of marketplace, 80% of Copart’s assigned volume comes from insurers, who are a pretty consolidated bunch, with the [top 5 underwriters accounting for just over half of US auto premiums](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/car-insurance/largest-auto-insurance-companies/). Buyers, by contrast, are highly fragmented. Copart has 750,000 of them spread across 170 countries. Any single buyer has very little bargaining power.

In between these consolidated sellers and diffuse buyers is a disciplined duopoly that commands 80% of salvage auction volumes in the US. The barriers to entry and scale are enormous. Insurers care about fast turnaround times and high selling prices. To meet these dual demands, an auction operator needs:

1/ real estate. When a car is damaged in an accident, it is transported to a local body shop or impound lot. The insurance company reviews the claim and, upon determining a total loss, will assign the car to a salvage auction operator, who then contacts the claimant to obtain a release and hires a third party tower to collect the car and transport it to a nearby Copart site. The longer the damaged car sits idle at the muni yard, the more storage charges the insurer pays, so Copart makes it a point to collect the car on the same day they get the release. Once the car lands at a Copart facility, it is cleared of personal belongings, photographed, and inventoried. The front-end workflow, from the time a claim is filed with an insurer to the day the damaged car is parked on Copart’s site after processing, runs about 2-3 days. Then Copart lets the vehicle sit for another week before auction to give interested buyers time to browse.

So that gets us to around 10 days compared to the total cycle time, from claim to auction sale, of about 30-60 days. Most of that 20-40 day delta comes comes from the administrative process around lien payoffs and titling. Depending on the DMV, transferring a title from the car owner to the salvage auction can take anywhere from a few days to over a month. This is by far the biggest bottleneck in the auction workflow and so long as it exists, an auction operator needs lots of land to accommodate the growing volume of totaled cars, especially during hurricanes and tropical storms. IAA’s lackluster service during Hurricane Harvey pushed a frustrated GEICO, once an exclusive top 3 customer, to shift 30% of their volume to Copart. Also, besides enabling faster turnaround times and claims recoveries, a vast real estate footprint limits the cost of towing cars from body shops to Copart sites. Nearly all of the volume that Copart is assigned from insurers falls under Percentage Incentive Program (PIP), in which Copart charges the insurer 1%-2% of the sales proceeds but is responsible for transport costs, so any savings in the latter falls to the bottom line.

Over the last 40 years, Copart has acquired more than 8,000 acres of land across 200 facilities; IAA has about the same amount of acreage, mostly leased. It would be super difficult for a newcomer to replicate this footprint. The zoning requirements are getting more onerous as no one wants loud polluting tow trucks hauling junked cars near their backyard all day long. NIMBY restrictions don’t just impede entry, they may also hinder IAA and Copart’s expansion plans. Both companies have launched some digital tools to speed up the transaction flow. Copart is reconfiguring the storage layout on some of its sites to squeeze 25%-30% more cars per acre, though they’re trading off some operational efficiencies in the process. But the point remains: without a real estate footprint comparable to Copart and IAA’s, you can’t attract volumes from insurers, and without those volumes, you won’t attract….

2/ buyers. This a simple case of cross-side network effects. As with any auction, more sellers mean more cars, which attracts more buyers, and more buyers means more bidding activity and higher sales prices. The network effects are global. Think AirBnB rather than Uber. A host in Paris adds value to outbound travelers in New York City (and vice versa). Likewise, cars auctioned in a Copart Sacramento CA yard can be purchased by any of its 750k buyers (“members”) in 170 countries. And with this massive global audience Copart can open yards in Europe, whose car parc is about the same size as the US’s and where the company has been growing its footprint since 2007, and immediately provide more value to insurers than local listing services.

In short, auto insurers care about two things: minimizing turnaround times and maximizing sales prices. If you wanted to win over insurers, who have 3 to 7 year contracts and systems integrations in place with Copart and IAA, and are besides notoriously reluctant to experiment with change, you’d have to not only somehow get around zoning restrictions to buy or lease thousands of acres across the country to speed cycle times but also simultaneously spin up a global network of buyers to rival Copart’s sales prices. Good luck with that.

It should come as no surprise Copart and IAA generate impressive returns….

![](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cprtx4-1.png)

….but Copart outperforms IAA both in terms of growth and profitability:

![](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/image.png)

(Note: IAA mostly leases properties while Copart owns. To make the comparison more apples-to-apples, I add back operating leases to calculate IAA’s EBIT and EBITDA margins. Also, Copart’s fiscal year ends in July; IAA’s ends in December, so the time periods don’t match, but close enough)

What’s the deal? I mean, both companies have about the same-sized real estate footprint (~9k acres across ~200 locations in the US) and sell about the same number of vehicles every year.

One explanation might be differences in the size and character of their respective buyers. All auctions used to be live and in-person, with the rapid fire vocalizations of a human auctioneer creating a frenzy of bid activity. But physical auctions also limited the buyer pool to local dismantlers and rebuilders, whose travel plans were sometimes stymied by harsh weather conditions. After observing many of its members paying brokers to attend physical auctions and place bids on their behalf, in 2003 Copart moved all its auction bidding online. Virtual Bidding 2.0 (VB2) was a radical change from how things were done at the time and was greeted with lots skepticism, but it turned out to be among the most important strategic moves in the company’s history. Besides cutting down on site overhead and freeing up land previously reserved for parking, this technology dramatically opened auctions to remote buyers from other states and even countries. Not only do international members create more vigorous bidding activity, but they are more likely than domestic members to purchase modestly damaged, higher priced cars and re-sell them in their own markets, where the regulations around selling cars with missing airbags or whatever are more lax. It’s cheaper for them to do this than to pay huge tariffs on whole car imports. IAA, on the other hand, ran a hybrid online/in-person model until COVID forced it to move 100% online. This 17-year delay resulted in a member base with fewer exporters compared to Copart, which I speculate translates into relatively lower sales prices, and this could be part of the reason why the company’s service revenue per vehicle is so much lower than Copart’s (~$700 vs. ~$1,000).

Since spinning off of KAR, IAA has been trying to attract international buyers, signing up Market Alliance partners in foreign countries to assist foreigners with bidding, transportation, and payments. At the same time, IAA is juicing per car fees with ancillary add-ons for buyers and sellers. Its Loan Payoff service digitally connects insurers with lenders to resolve any outstanding loan balances attached to the vehicle, cutting down on the number of faxes and manual steps, supposedly shaving ~20 days off cycle time. IAA Transport connects buyers with a network of towers and international carriers who can deliver vehicles to a specific location. These services complement pre-KAR spin off products like Inspection Services and Title Services that speed up the process of determining a total loss and managing title documentation and procurement. IAA is also giving buyers more confidence to bid, its Interact Platform featuring Engine Start videos so buyers can hear and see an car’s engine, as well as 360 degree views, high resolution images, and technical information. But none of these add-ons are unique. Copart has most of these offerings.

Copart’s advantage could also tie back to “culture”. I recently re-read _Junk to Gold_, where Copart’s founder, executive Chairman, and 7% shareholder, Willis J. Johnson, describes his personal upbringing and the history of Copart through around 2013. For the well-to-do pedigreed founders dramatizing their start-up origins with metaphors of chewing glass and whatnot, pssshh, meet Willis Johnson, who as a kid woke up at 3 in the morning to milk cows and as a teenager, fought in the Vietnam, lost close friends in combat, won a Purple Heart and Metal of Merit for heroism, and dug shrapnel out of his body for 15 years afterward, about which he laconically shrugs, Forrest Gump-like, “I guess there are just some things you have to do”. Y’all are strategizing on Macbooks from the comfort of well ventilated offices and bedrooms. Willis lived in a small trailer with his wife and daughter on Copart’s first salvage yard, mice scratching at the trailer’s walls, windows rattling as planes from the nearby airbase flew by.

Willis J. was a customer of salvage auctions before he ran his own. As a dismantler, he’d buy cars at salvage auctions, sell the parts to local body shops and the scrap iron to recycling yards. This was a family affair. While Willis towed the cars and dismantled them, his brother-in-law sold the parts to body shops and his wife worked with DMV to process titles while his kids cleaned out the totaled cars. _Junk to Gold_ is full of plucky hustle and grind stories, with spurts of inspiration and opportunism translating into big payoffs. While peers acquired popular models, Willis carved a niche in slow-moving parts from cheaper Chrysler, Dodge, and Plymouth cars. When he discovered that Chrysler was shutting down slow moving Volares and Aspen brands, Johnson acquired brand new factory parts from the mothballed production plants, becoming a major re-seller of Chrysler parts. While at an airport, he randomly encountered Desoto cab drivers with Volares and Aspen models and convinced them to order parts for him, which then led to huge parts deals with Yellow Cab and Luxor. During the oil crisis of 1973, he loaded up on parts for fuel-efficient vehicles, and sourced cheap but equivalent aftermarket sheet metal from Taiwan. Johnson copied a self-service model and launched what would soon become his largest money-maker, U-Pull-It, where wrecked cars were hoisted on stands on big plots of land and customers, after paying a 50c entry fee, would pull the parts they wanted themselves. He even built an adjacent thrift store to sell the CDs, clothing and other items left behind in acquired cars.

Along the way, Willis reinvested his profits and collateralized everything he had to lever up and expand. The unit economics were too compelling not to and business was booming. To keep up with demand, he spent $110k on computer systems. This was before 1980, when spending 6 figures on IT to manage junk yards would have been considered very strange. But the bet paid off. With this new technology, he was able to keep close tabs on inventory and business operations – how many left and right doors from such and such make and model were in the yard, how fast each part was moving – which gave him the information necessary to optimally order and price parts. Faced with the bottleneck of transferring titles, which required filling out paper forms and sending them to the DMV, Johnson spent $40k building a computer system for the state of California.

The seed of what would become the Copart we know today was Bob’s Tow Service (BTS), a family run salvage auction where Willis used to source junked cars for his dismantling business. Johnson paid $1mn to acquire Bob’s $65k in pretax income, thinking he could accelerate growth in a business that was up until that point being managed for cash. Now at the time, Willis ran an industry trade magazine, _Copart_, in which he and other specialized yards in the Sacramento area advertised used parts (a “co-op” of parts dealers) to readers, namely mechanics and insurance companies. BTS was fused into the Copart C-Corp, assuming Copart’s name in the process. Over the next several years, Willis bought out his partners, changed the business from sealed bids to live auctions to stoke fomo bidding and higher prices, and continued to buy more land. In 1995, he expanded operations in the Northeast by purchasing NER Auction Group, its largest acquisition at the time.

But of all Willis’ savvy business decisions, perhaps the most consequential one would be hiring his son-in-law, Jayson (”Jay”) Adair. This is not the usual tale of nepotism. Jay worked the yards, monitored inventory, drove forklifts, swept floors. Following Willis’ lead, he and his wife even moved into a trailer on the Sacramento yard to stay close to the business. Jay possessed a true passion for the business, examined nearly every part of it, and became a competent sounding board for Willis. Years later, as President of Copart, he evolved into a cultural leader and upheld customer service as a core value. During Hurricane Katrina, Copart employees left their families and lived in trailers for weeks to help out. With reports of armed men looting stores, Jay, who as President of the company would have been perfectly justified steering clear of the danger area, arrived in New Orleans strapped (for protection, not looting ;)).

He re-angled Copart’s long-term performance trajectory by taking technology and electronic bidding seriously, spending $3mn and halting break-neck growth in the mid/late-90s to build a unified back-end system, Copart Auction System (CAS), that could track how many of each model car was being picked up and sold across all yards every day. With a growing proportion of buyers placing bids by phone or through brokers, Jay realized that by leveraging CAS, Copart could put inventory on the internet and accept bids online. By 2000, 40% of Copart’s members were bidding electronically. Three years later, Copart pushed all bidding online, expanding the member base to include out-of-state and foreign buyers, giving rise to higher sales prices and greater recoveries for insurers. In contrast to Copart, IAA operated hybrid online/in-person auctions until 2020 and is now scrambling to attract international bidders.

There are several other notable differences in strategy, operations, and culture relayed in _Junk to Gold_ (this version of events is filtered through Willis’ undoubtedly biased lens, so all the usual caveats apply). Whereas Copart standardized all acquired locations onto their systems and processes, training acquihires on its way of doing things, IAA left its locations alone, with each site running its own siloed IT and revenue models (one insurance customer I recently spoke with says that Copart provides more consistent service and accuracy than IAA). And whereas IAA splurged on expensive leases in big cities, Copart sought to own properties in more remote locations. Then there are the cowboy boots:

_IAA would show up wearing suits and riding in limos. I showed up wearing cowboy boots and driving a rental car…IAA bought companies the Wall Street way – based on pre-tax or after-tax earnings. I had my own method based on how many cars the auction sold and the value of the land. I knew what didn’t show up on the balance sheet of a private, family-owned company – that many of these business owners used a lot of their profits to buy personal cars or pay salaries and benefits to their family members. Many of the businesses were undervalued as a result. I paid a little more for these businesses, but I was also able to see their potential._

By Willis’ framing, IAA haphazardly grabbed land for the sake of Wall Street optics while Copart was guided by long-term value creation and first principles thinking. Some of this comes through in my conversations with former employees. One IAA yard manager claimed that years ago, prior to 2016, IAA had the opportunity to acquire a certain tract of land at a fraction of its worth. But management blindly adhered to “capital light” dogma and instead signed a costly 10 year lease with rent escalators. He also conveyed that IAA was stifled by bureaucracy and failed to build capacity as fast as they needed to during hurricanes. Some of this might be changing now that IAA is an independent company – for instance, they seem more receptive to buying land rather than just leasing. But in listening to the earnings calls of Copart vs. IAA during peak COVID, you get the sense that some of the core cultural differences remain. While IAA was taking “swift action” to rationalize its cost structure and limit capex, Copart didn’t furlough any employees, kept contributing to 401(k)s, and…

_“continued throughout the quarter to develop that land. We think this is necessary to the long-term success of Copart. We’d note we spent more in capital expenditures this past quarter than we did in all of fiscal 2015 in support of ours and our customers’ future growth. Again, more than 80% of our CapEx was attributable to investing in capacity expansion….it’s not a 1-month, 18-month, even a 3-year decision. We acquire land because it makes sense over a 5- to 20-year horizon._

…_Mobility isn’t just commuting to work. It’s also necessary for leisure, for health care, for education and that those 100-year trends really will continue perhaps with a meaningful interruption as it stands today. So believing those underlying principles, I think, leads us to want to invest to support our own growth and that of our customers. So I think it’d be irresponsible for us to arrest that process mid-course.”_

(Copart earnings call, May 21, 2020)

Another yard manager I spoke with believes that Copart was more careful about network structure, acquiring land in strategic locations that enabled lower tow costs. I’m just speculating, but it may be that Copart was forced to pay closer attention to network design than IAA because in return for a cut of the sale proceeds, Copart absorbs all the tow costs. IAA, by contrast, runs a predominantly fixed fee model, where it directly passes tow expenses through to sellers. Of the possible explanations for Copart’s outperformance posed here, I’m least convinced by the network design argument. In the early days this may have mattered, but today each company has like 10k acres of land everywhere, so I’m inclined to think that this advantage has been largely neutralized.

Finally, I think there is something to be said about management and cultural continuity. As detailed in this profile of IAA from [Funding Universe](http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/insurance-auto-auctions-inc-history/):

_IAA’s sales increased from $38 million in 1990 to almost $282 million by 1996, catapulting the company to a leading role in its highly fragmented industry. IAA’s net income was on a downward trend in the mid-1990s, declining from nearly $11 million in 1994 to just over $3 million in 1996. Founder and longtime CEO Bradley Scott relinquished day-to-day leadership of the company in March 1996, but continued to serve as chairman of the board. His successor, Jim Alampi, was recruited from a chemical distribution company. Scott’s retirement capped a half-decade of turnover in IAA’s upper echelon; as of 1996, all but three of the company’s top eleven executives joined the chain after its 1991 initial public stock offering. Around the same time, IAA reorganized into three geographic divisions and moved its headquarters from Southern California to a suburb of Chicago, Illinois._

In 2000/2001, IAA’s entire C-suite was replaced by outsiders with no industry experience. Here are some summary financials from the 2004 10-K. Doesn’t look great:

![](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cprtx5.png)

Granted, during this time IAA was still on the tail end of transitioning from a merchant model, (directly purchasing vehicles from insurers and reselling them), to an agency model (earning consignment fees for intermediating a sale), which had a negative impact on revenue (the gross selling price of the vehicle is no longer recognized as revenue) and a positive impact on margins (gross margins on purchased car sales are very low at just ~10%-15%). Even so, by 2004, with less than 4% of volumes sold under purchase agreements, IAA was still generating just 19% EBIT margins (before lease expense) compared to 31% for Copart. Then in 2005, after 14 years as a public company, IAA was taken private and merged into whole car auctioneer, ADESA, 2 years later, the combined entity taking the name KAR Auction Services. IAA returned to the public markets again after spinning-off from KAR in 2019.

Copart’s leadership lineage has been stable by comparison. Founder Willis Johnson retired as CEO in 2010 but still sits as Executive Chairman and owns 7% of the company. Jay Adair, who joined Copart at the age of 19 and has been Johnson’s right hand for the last 30 years, took over as CEO. Besides a base salary of $1.00, Jay is paid entirely in stock options[<sup>2</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/cprt1/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-34080) and owns close to 4% of shares outstanding (a few months ago Jeff Liaw, who joined the company as CFO in 2016, was appointed co-CEO). The Chief Sales and Operating Officers were brought into Copart during the NER acquisition in 1995.

This longstanding management team today faces a weird and disruptive set of industry dynamics in the auto market today, some of which I touched upon in my [latest Carvana/CarMax post.](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/kmx_cvna_2/) To summarize, production constraints have led to new car shortages, which in turn have pushed demand into used cars, fueling rapid price appreciation. All else equal, rising car prices are bad for salvage auction volumes. To return to my repair vs. salvage example earlier, if the pre-accident value of a car goes from $10,000 to $20,000 and the cost of repair ($6,000) and the value realized in a salvage auction ($4,000) remain the same, well, now by deeming the car a total loss, the insurer is out $16,000 ($20,000 to the claimant minus $4,000 recovered in auction). It makes far more sense now to pay $6,000 to restore the car to its PAV. It works the other way too obviously. Copart’s management says that used car price declines would be offset to some extent higher salvage assignment volumes.

But it seems to me what’s important is not so much used car prices per se, but the relationship between used car prices, salvage auction prices, and repair costs. All else is never equal and changes in one part of the value chain have knock-on effects everywhere else. When used car prices go up, rebuilders will compete more aggressively at salvage auctions. And today’s high used car prices coincide with parts and labor shortages everywhere, making it more expensive to repair vehicles and more lucrative to sell used parts recovered on salvaged cars. Hence, Copart’s volumes have actually grown over the last few years alongside ASP appreciation.

That’s not to say rising salvage ASPs are a strict function of what happens to used car, scrap, and parts prices, factors that are outside management’s control. Copart’s ASPs have appreciated an by an average of ~25%-30% y/y in the post-COVID quarters, more than double the lift in used car prices reported by Manheim and NADA. Nor does this appear to be a COVID-specific phenomenon. ASP growth consistently outpaced used car pricing by a wide margin even prior to 2020. With the exception of one quarter at the start of the pandemic, pricing has appreciated for 20 straight quarters.

One of the key drivers of this is the growing presence of international buyers, who now make up around 40% of Copart’s buyers. Management claims that the prices on 90% of auctioned cars are impacted by bids from international buyers, meaning auction prices are rising on a like-for-like basis. And because salvage pricing and volume are linked – the more value an insurer can recoup at auction, the more likely they are to deem damaged cars a total loss – there is likely a positive double whammy effect, where Copart benefits from higher ASPs as well as more assigned volumes drawn by those ASPs. Moreover, as discussed, foreign buyers not only create more auction liquidity but, compared to domestic buyers, also bid on more damaged but drivable, higher value cars. As developing economies continue to mature, their appetite for vehicles should continue to expand, creating an expanding buyer base for many years to come.

This is part of a more general trend where cars, due to their costlier-to-repair content, are far more likely to be assigned to auction than sent to a body shop. A growing mix of Copart’s assigned volumes is coming from dealers, further lifting ASPs and inviting the possibility that the company migrates to dealer-to-dealer whole car auctions, in competition with ADESA and Manheim, whose cars are like 2x-3x the price of those sold at salvage. IAA has hinted at growing its presence here after its non-compete with KAR expires in a few years. Copart recently launched Copart Select for late model, lower mileage vehicles in drivable condition while at the same time reducing its exposure to lower ASP charity cars. Former Copart and IAA employees I spoke with are skeptical about this move because of space constraints and workflow differences. We’ll see.

Anyways, when it comes to ASPs, it’s hard to disentangle cyclical effects (used car prices, scrap prices, currency effects on foreign demand) from company-specific and secular drivers (bid density, car mix, buyer mix). But over the near/medium term, the negative impacts from mean reversion on the former should be somewhat blunted by the latter, and over long time spans, higher ASPs and add-on services seem to be lifting revenue per car by about 5%-6% a year[<sup>3</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/cprt1/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-34080). Combined with 5% volume tailwind from rising total loss rates, I think there’s a long visible path to ~10% growth in service revenue (by comparison, from fy12 to fy19, Copart’s service revenue has grown by 13%/year).

In the US, which still accounts for 84% of revenue and capex investment, growth should translate into steady margin expansion as higher ASPs and revenue add-ons drop down to profits, and Copart leverages the fixed cost of yard operations and G&A (from fy14 to fy20 (ending July), US EBITDA grew 19%/year on 13% revenue growth). The International segment is, for now, structurally lower margin because it still derives 40% of revenue still comes from low-margin vehicle purchases (vs. just 13% in the US). I don’t think this is a permanent state of affairs. In new countries, insurers will often sell damaged cars directly to Copart rather than bear price risk in an auction, but over time, as Copart continues to prove its value by generating higher returns than local listing services, these markets should evolve toward a consignment model. As this happens, the substantial EBITDA margin gap between the US and International (29% vs. 49%) should narrow and provide added lift to Copart’s overall margins. That is all to say that through a combination of operating leverage, ASP gains, and international margin gap closure, I think you can pencil out ~low/mid-teens earnings growth.

Copart has a history of chunky buybacks – retiring 14% of its shares in 2011 and another 11% in 2015 through Dutch tenders, then nothing fy17 and fy18, followed by a big buyback in fy19, then nothing, nothing – which is what you want to see as a shareholder. These repurchases were done at around 20x earnings compared to Copart’s current valuation of 25x. You might argue that if Copart isn’t buying its own shares why should I, though keep in mind that the company is probably generating 25%-30% pre-tax returns on incremental land investments, the most significant use of cash today. But as the stock drifts lower, it’s nice to know that management at least thinks about opportunity cost.

That includes a tow up to 25 air miles. When the vehicle gets to a Copart location, it will be washed and vacuumed, then it will be put up on sale where you can run it through Copart auctions for up to four weeks at no additional fees. Once it sells, there is a 2% sale fee with a $50 minimum and a $150 maximum. The least you’ll pay is $135, and the most you’ll ever pay is $235”.[](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/cprt1/#easy-footnote-1-34080)
2.  from the Copart proxy statement reported 10/22/21: _“Nearly three decades of strong stock price performance by Copart and more than thirty years as a senior executive of Copart have enabled Mr. Adair to build substantial personal wealth. Copart stock remains the most significant portion of his wealth, totaling $1.17 billion as of October 11, 2021 based on the value of outstanding shares held by him. Our compensation committee does not believe that a “median” or even “above median” compensation program would create sufficient incentives for an individual with Mr. Adair’s personal wealth to maximize stockholder value”_.[](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/cprt1/#easy-footnote-2-34080)
