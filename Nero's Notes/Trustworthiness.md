# Trustworthiness
Trustworthiness is common among quality companies. We view investing as a long-term relationship, the essence of which is trust. Trust is predicated on honesty and integrity. As with other investors, we avoid staking funds in dishonest or dishonorable organizations, and fortunately thoroughly crooked corporate cultures are rare. But in business, some people and companies are more trustworthy then others. The difference often manifests itself in small revelations of corporate culture.

A common example concerns handling of bad news. Some companies obfuscate or delay reporting adverse developments while others promptly  and forthrightly disclose them. While often dismissed as a matter of corporate communication or legal requirement, the difference reflects profoundly on relative trustworthiness. A corporate culture of open and frank confrontation of facts is healthy, The approach to sharing information externally is also likely to be mirrored internally. Managers who mislead the market are likely training employees to mislead them. Likewise, we value companies that voluntarily confide their mistakes and discuss the lessons learned from them, because such exercises reflect a [[corporate culture]] committed to [[Experimentation]] and improvement.
