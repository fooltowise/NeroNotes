# Distributor Moat Typology

## _What are distributors?_ 

Distributors are companies that buy products from manufacturers (or suppliers) and then sell those products to end customers. They often serve as crucial intermediaries in the supply chain, providing logistics, warehousing, and marketing services to help get products of the manufacturer to the end customer as efficiently and effectively as possible. Distributors are agile in the sense that their core offerings can switch in near real-time, as the demands of the market evolve. Contrast this with a manufacturer who may find their product obsolete and face permanent impairment if they are caught offside at any point of their product lifecycle.

## _Where do distributors thrive?_ 

There are certain corners of the marketplace that cast more favorable dynamics for distributors. For starters, distributors do well serving highly fragmented customer bases with low purchasing power. These customers ultimately have a need for an abundance of different products but purchase these products at low to moderate quantity intervals. If these products are sourced from a wide variety of manufacturers and suppliers, the relationship of the distributor as the middleman becomes even more valuable in the supply chain. This gives us a dynamic component to measure how well the distributor is growing. The function of total suppliers multiplied by total customers presents us with a power output of the network value. The position of the distributor strengthens further the greater the disbursement of the customer’s geographic proximity. Said differently, a distributor with 1,000 customers is more valuable if those customers are scattered across 50 countries versus isolated in just five countries. For sales processes that require a more personal approach or even an in-person touch, the value of a distributor deepens. When end customers are sprinkled across territories with different language and regulatory burdens, a competent distributor can find itself with a formidable moat in the marketplace.

## _What hurts a distributor?_

Like all businesses, distributors aren’t immune to the forces of the marketplace. The incumbent distributor finds itself not only in competition with other distributors but also under threat of being cannibalized by the products it peddles. The most direct threat to a distributor is when a manufacturer or supplier reaches a point of critical mass within the market that the distributor serves. At this point the manufacturer can set up a local shop, bypassing the needs of a distributor altogether. This can also be achieved by supplier consolidation. Overall, the moat of a distributor shrinks with each new territory that its supplier enters. While this is the main threat to a distributor, the end customers are also capable of a formidable attack. Remember, distributors thrive by serving customers with low purchasing power. Customers that band together to form purchasing groups (or join Group Purchasing Organizations), can not only put pricing pressure on the distributor but also bypass the distributor altogether if there is no logistical hurdle to the fulfillment process. In addition, distributors must battle moderate duration pricing risk. If suppliers increase prices and the distributor has fixed pricing contracts with customers, this can wreak havoc on margins. 

## _How does a distributor play defense?_ 

Distributors understand these threats and the best have good countermeasures in place. To offset the threat of critical mass, distributors keep the number of suppliers in abundance, never letting the sales of a single product grow too high in concentration. If that doesn’t do the trick, distributors can remove the threat altogether by launching or acquiring the manufacturing functions of the product that is reaching critical mass. To counter pressure from customers forming purchasing groups, distributors can offer value add services like training and seminars. This positions the distributor as a crucial value add expert for their end customers as opposed to just a commoditized middleman. Perhaps most valuable, the distributor can build out infrastructure to deliver products faster to the end customer. This serves as a win in two functions as it’s less replicable by manufacturers and end customers while simultaneously strengthening the distributor's position in comparison to other distributors. For duration pricing risk on contracts, distributors can leverage their surplus of market data pricing to account for supplier increases, or structure accelerators and other functions within the contract with customers that adjust the pricing risk. 

The distributor business model passes my first test of longevity (and thus long shelf life for our accumulated knowledge). The model is timeless and well-proven across different historical periods. If you don’t believe me, take a look at Casa de Ganaderos of Spain. The company was founded in 1218 (five years removed from its 800th anniversary!) as a meat distributor and still operates today.

What I’m finding more fascinating is how well the distributor model passes my test of industry agility and transferability. Take a look at a few of the most popular distributors and their share price returns over the last 10 years:

Sure you can say I’m cherry-picking winners, but the point worth emphasizing is distributors have proven to work across an assortment of industries, offering long-term compounding under the right conditions. It’s evident to me, this is a good area to turn over more rocks.

If I’ve convinced you distributors are at least worth keeping an eye on, then hopefully you’ll be pleased to know we have some exposure already in our portfolio. For example, [[Lifco]] has a phenomenal dental distribution business. The entire dental business makes up roughly 25% of [[Lifco]]’s total sales. Since 2006, the entire dental business has grown the top line by 11.6% per year, proving its operating leverage with EBITA compounding 15.3% annually over that same period (half of which is attributable to organic growth). The distribution business within dental spans a total of 13 countries across the Nordics, Baltics, and other parts of Eastern Europe, and is the market leader in the Nordics and Germany. It provides a healthy mix of consumables and equipment, while also using the footprint to assist with adjacent market offerings of the portfolio for dental prosthetic and software lines of business.

Overall, the company plays the distribution model like a fiddle. It patiently waits for distribution acquisitions to surface in strategic outposts. It moves up the value chain for product lines that dance towards critical mass. It increases its offering with niche products relevant to its end customers. It operates and expands across territories with differing regulatory and language barriers, further deepening its overall moat. Year by year, the company spins its web, creating a stronger distribution business with powerful network effects.
