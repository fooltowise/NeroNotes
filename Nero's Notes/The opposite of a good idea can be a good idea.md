Sometimes both a thing and its opposite can be good ideas, especially in business.

For instance, consider how we infer the attractiveness of an object from how widespread it is:
- "Not many people own one of these, so it must be good" ( see  [[Veblen goods]])
- "Lots of people already own one of these, so it must be good" ( see [[Social Proof]])

In fact, in many occasions the worst strategy is to stay in the middle, where your solution is not going far enough in either of the two directions.
