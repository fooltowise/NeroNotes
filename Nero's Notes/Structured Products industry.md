# Structured Products Industry
The industry of selling structured products is successful because of the [[Agency Business Model]] incarnated by the distribution fee.

Structured Products are commodities. For a same payoff and a reasonable issuer's balance sheet, it does not matter if a reverse convertible is sold from issuer A or issuer B. The difference should only be in the price offered by the issuer.

But the main point of the industry is that the issuer is rarely dealing directly with the end investor. The end investor usually uses an agent (an asset manager or a private banker), and the issuer will bribe the agent with a *distribution fee* so he can sell the product at a higher price.

Here is how it works:
- The end investor mandates the private banker to manage his account worth 1'000 CHF
- The issuer would like to sell a structured product worth 950 CHF and approaches the private banker. However, since his product is a commodity, he could face a strong competition from other issuers, and it is not obvious that the private banker will buy from him.
- The issuer then bribes the private banker in the following way:
	- The private banker will buy the product worth 950 CHF at an inflated price, say 1'000 CHF
	- The issuer will take a commission of 10 CHF called the sales credits (that's the issuer's margin)
	- The issuer will pay a 40 CHF kickback to the private banker to *thank him* of distributing his product. This kickback is called a *distribution fee* and incentivise the agent to buy from the issuer independently of the needs of the end investor.
	- The structured product will start quoting at 1'000 CHF and both the sales credits and the distribution fees are amortized linearly over a period of a few months. If the market does not move, the product's quoted price will slowly decrease toward 950 CHF over a few months so that the end customer does not figure out how his agent has been bribed.
