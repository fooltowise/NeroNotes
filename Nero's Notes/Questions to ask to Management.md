# Questions to ask to management


## On culture:

- Let's hypothetically say that the son or daughter of a good friend of yours is going to work at the company. He starts next week and you'll have a coffee with him this afternoon. What are the three pieces of advice you are going to give him to be successful in the company? (See [[Mike Trigg - Defying the fade at WCM|Mike Trigg's interview]])


## On Decentralization

- How small would you allow your business units to get? (Allows to sense for the degree of decentralization/complexity in the company). It also elicits if management is a follower of the gospel of "economies of scale" or not.
