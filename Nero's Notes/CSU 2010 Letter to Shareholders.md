# [[CSU]] 2010 Letter to Shareholders

## TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
On April 4th, Constellation’s board announced that it was undertaking a review of the strategic alternatives for the company, with the objective of enhancing shareholder value. In your shoes, I’d interpret that as meaning that the company is likely to be sold. In the ~40% appreciation of CSI’s stock since January 2011, we have presumably seen the market reflecting some of that takeover premium. 

The marketing of the company to prospective buyers has, and will be, a considerable distraction to the managers and employees of the company. We can’t be sure that it will result in an acceptable offer. We hope to get through this process as quickly as possible, generate some liquidity for our major shareholders, and then get back to building our business. 

This may be my last chance to publicly commend our managers and employees for many years of spectacular performance. In Table 1 below, I’ve updated the performance metrics that we presented last year. This analysis is no substitute for reading our audited annual financial results and statutory filings, however it does provide a nice synopsis of some metrics that we believe are important. It also highlights the remarkable returns that our employees have generated with our shareholders’ funds.

The definitions of Adjusted Net Income, Average Invested Capital, ROIC and Net Revenue appear in the Glossary below. 

As I explained in last year’s Letter to Shareholders, we believe that the sum of ROIC and Organic Net Revenue Growth is the best single metric for measuring the performance of a low asset intensity software business, closely reflecting the increase in Shareholders’ value. For 2010 this number was 25%, a nice improvement from 2009. The increase was due in large part to near record levels of ROIC and a slightly smaller contraction in the Net Revenue of our existing businesses. By late 2010, our Organic Net Revenue Growth was once again positive, and 2011 is showing encouraging signs of a continued resurgence in Organic Net Revenue growth, accompanied by even better returns on Invested Capital. 

We traditionally report on our Maintenance Revenue as part of this letter. Maintenance is the most profitable part of our business and can provide an insight into whether the long-term intrinsic value of our business is increasing or decreasing. During 2010 we experienced 7% organic growth and 28% acquired growth in Maintenance Revenue. New Maintenance, i.e. maintenance derived from new clients or associated with add-on module sales to existing clients, contributed 8% to the growth in Maintenance Revenue during the year. This performance reflects well on the competitiveness of our products and the value that our solutions can deliver to clients, even during a recessionary period. We lost only 4% of our customers in 2010, a number that has been remarkably consistent over the last 5 years. Some of these customers we lost to bankruptcies or acquisitions… others to competitors. No matter how you look at it, our customers stay with us for a very long time, suggesting both the high switching costs and the real customer loyalty benefits that are inherent in our businesses.

In aggregate our Maintenance Revenue increased at a 35% rate in 2010. We believe that Adjusted EBITA correlates well with Maintenance Revenue, hence we’d argue that our enterprise value is appreciating at a similar pace. Another vantage point from which to judge the long term appreciation in shareholder value per share is presented in Table 3 below.

In 2010 our Revenue per Share and Cash Flow from Operating Activities (“CFOA”) per share increased 44% and 29% respectively. For the last decade, Revenue per Share has increased approximately ten fold i.e. a 26% compound average annual growth rate. CFOA per share increased at a compound annual average growth rate of 56% over that same period. This is a bit misleading because cash flows in 2000 were unusually poor, but measuring from the following year (when CFOA/Revenue was a respectable 16%), the compound average annual growth rate has been 30%. I’m proud of the company that our employees and shareholders have built, and will be more than a little sad if it is sold. 

We will be hosting the annual general meeting on Thursday May 5th. Many of our Directors and Officers and a number of our General Managers will be in attendance. We look forward to talking about our business and answering your questions. I hope to see you there.
