Everybody cheats.
In collatborative environments with lots of [[norms]], cheating allows us to reap the rewards without paying the costs.

Our ancestors did a lot of cheating. One source of evidence is the fact that our brains have special-purpose adaptations for detecting cheaters.
But if our ancestors needed to evolve brains that were good at cheater detection, it's because their peers were routinely trying to cheat them - and those peers where also our ancestors. Thus early humans were locked in an evolutionary arms race, pitting the skills of some cheating against  the skills of others at detecting cheating.

Human brains also have adaptations that helps us cheat and evade [[norms]]. The most basic way to get away with something is simply to avoid being seen.  One of our norm-evasing adaptations, then, is to be highly attuned to the gaze of others, especially when it is directed at us.

**All the techniques for norm evasion work by the same mechanism, in that they prevent a norm violation from becoming full [[Common Knowledge]], which makes it more difficult to prosecute.**
