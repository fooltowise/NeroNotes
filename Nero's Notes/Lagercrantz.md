## Business Segments

Compared to other companies in the [[Bergman & Beving]] family, Lagercrantz is more focused on the manufacturing of proprietary industrial products, with value-added sales and system integration. 

They do a bit of distribution, but it is only 19% of total sales.



## M&A

In the recent years, the company has been restructured in five divisions. The major change is that now every division has its own M&A department, so that the CEO does not become a bottleneck. Acquisitions are still validated at the board level though.
