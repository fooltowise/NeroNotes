- Changes in supply drive industry profitability. Stock prices often fail to anticipate shifts in the supply side.
- The value/growth dichotomy is false. Companies in industries with a supportive supply side can justify high valuations.
- Management's [[Capital Allocation]] skills are paramount, and meetings with management often provide valuable insights.
- Investment bankers drive the [[capital cycle]], largely to the detriment of investors
- When policymakers interfere with the capital cycle, the market clearing process may be arrested. New technologies can also disrupt the normal operation of the capital cycle.
- Generalists are better able to adopt the "outside view" necessary for [[capital cycle analysis]].
- Long-term investors are better suited to applying the capital cycle approach.
