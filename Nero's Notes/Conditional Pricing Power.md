A common pricing pattern is what we call *conditional pricing power*. A company enjoying pockets of [[Pricing Power]] due to select but recurring sales contexts. For example, an aircraft engine manufacturer may enjoy pricing power on its service business but this is conditional on its having closed a sale, where it may lack pricing power. Similarly, companies boasting loyal [[The Friendly Middleman| middlemen]] who impose effective monopolies likely enjoy a degree of pricing power. While far from uniform, conditional pricing power is more likely to be underappreciated by the market, making it of potentially great value to a quality investor.
