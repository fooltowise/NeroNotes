# Dividends and Buybacks

Excess cash - funds a company does not need to reinvest in the business or to seize attractive opportunities - should be distributed to shareholders as dividends or share buybacks.

Managers have considerable discretion in this area of capital allocation, so we appreciate companies that clearly explain buyback and dividend policy in their disclosures.

Too often, companies repurchase excessively during periods of economic expansion, when stock prices are high, and insufficiently during economic downturns, when prices are low. Both propensities reduce rather than build value, the fist by giving away more than is received and the latter by depriving shareholders of cash when it is particularly valuable to them.
