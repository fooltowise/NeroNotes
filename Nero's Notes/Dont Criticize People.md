# Don't Criticize People

- Most people [[Counterfeit reasons|rationalize]] their bad behavior to justify their antisocial acts to other people and most importantly to themselves. People hate to blame themselves. **They don't criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be.**
- Criticism is **futile** because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to **justify** himself. 
- Criticism is **dangerous**, because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses **resentment**.

By criticizing, we do not make lasting changes and often incur resentment. Sharp criticisms and rebukes almost invariably end in futility. 

When dealing with people, let's remember that we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.

**Instead of  condemning people, let's try to understand them. Let's try to figure out why they do what they do. That's a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism; and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness. "To know all is to forgive all."**
