# Deliberate Practice

In *So good they can't ignore you*, Cal Newport writes that the key to find a career where you have control and impact is to first build career capital, i.e acquiring rare and valuable skills that people are willing to pay for. The way to build this career capital is through deliberate practice, i.e [[Deep Work]]: set aside time to work on hard problems which are stretching your brain and that very few other people are willing to do.

[[Naval Ravikant]] said as well that personal leverage comes through specializing in one area which feels like play to oneself (so you are motivated to spend a lot of time on it), but feels like work to others, so you put yourself in a situation where you don't have any competition. See [[How to get rich (without getting lucky)]]

Another alternative is Scott Adams' [[Skill stack]]. Learn many skills where you are not the absolute best (not in the top 1%) but reasonably good (top 25%) so that the mixing of these skills create a combination where you do not have competition. For instance, *Dilbert* is a combination of drawing, humor and corporate place knowledge.

Deliberate practice is a highly structured activity with the specific goal of improving performance. It requires continuous evaluation, feedback, and a lot of mental effort.

There are some key elements of deliberate practice:
1. **It's repeatable**: If you're a writer, you write a lot. If you are a musician, you know the importance of repeating your notes.
2. **There is a constant feedback**: Learning occurs when you get lots of feedback tied closely in time to decisions and actions. And deliberate practice constantly refers back to results-based feedback. No mistakes go unnoticed. In fact, every error is a crucial piece of information for further improvement. The feedback can come from your own observation of from a coach or mentor who can notice the things which aren't always visible to you.
3. **It is hard**: Deliberate practice takes significant mental effort.
4. **It isn't much fun**: Most people don't enjoy doing activities that they're not good at. It's no fun to fail over and over again an to receive criticism on how you can improve. Yet deliberate practice is specifically designed to focus on things you are weak at, and it requires you to practice those skills over and over again until you become a master at them.
