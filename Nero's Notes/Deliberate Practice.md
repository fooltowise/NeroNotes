In *So good they can't ignore you*, Cal Newport writes that the key to find a career where you have control and impact is to first build career capital, i.e acquiring rare and valuable skills that people are willing to pay for. The way to build this career capital is through deliberate practice: set aside time to work on hard problems which are stretching your brain and that very few other people are willing to do.

Naval Ravikant said as well that personal leverage comes through specializing in one area which feels like play to oneself (so you are motivated to spend a lot of time on it), but feels like work to others, so you put yourself in a situation where you don't have any competition. See [[How to get rich (without getting lucky)]]

Another alternative is Scott Adams' [[Skill stack]]. Learn many skills where you are not the absolute best (not in the top 1%) but reasonably good (top 25%) so that the mixing of these skills create a combination where you do not have competition. For instance, *Dilbert* is a combination of drawing, humor and corporate place knowledge.
