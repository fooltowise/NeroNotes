### Stock options as compensation

If you look at the impact of stock options, you'll see a lot of terrible behavior. To give a lot of options to a CEO who built the business and is in his sixties, to incent loyalty, is demented. Would the doctors at the Mayo Clinic or the lawyers at Cravath who are in their sixties work harder if they had options?

As our shareholders know, our system is different from most big corporations. We think it's less capricious. The stock option system may give extraordinary rewards to some people who did nothing, and give nothing to those who deserve a lot. Except when we inherit it (a stock option program), we don't use it.

### Valuing options and the Black Scholes Model
Black-Scholes works for short-term options, but if it's a long-term option and you think you know something (about the underlying asset), it's insane to use Black-Scholes.

Black-Scholes is a know-nothing system. If you know nothing about value - only price - then Black-Scholes is a pretty good guess at what a ninety-day option might be worth. But the minute you get into longer periods of time, it's crazy to get into Black-Scholes.

For example, at Costco we issued stock options with strike prices of $30 and $60, and Black Scholes valued the $60 ones higher. This is insane.

### Accounting for stock options
The theory that options have no cost has contributed to a lot of excesses, which is bad for the country because corporate compensation is perceived as unfair.

I'm so tired of this subject. I've been on this topic for so long. It's such a rotten way to run a civilization to make the accounting wrong. It's like getting the engineering wrong when making a bridge. When perfectly reputable people say options shouldn't be expensed, it's outrageous.

A stock option is both an expense *and* dilution. To argue anything else is insane.
These people (the eighty-eight senators who voted to maintain the status quo of not expensing stock options) are stupid and dishonorable. They knew it was wrong and did it anyway.

The only thing that's consistent is that the whole thing is disgusting. I'd rather make my money playing piano in a whorehouse than account for options as recommended by John Doerr.
