![ðŸ¦„ Blake Emal Profile picture](https://threadreaderapp.com/images/avatars/2226076345?refresh=1653834339328)

56% of all web visits happen on a phone.

I studied 100s of mobile landing pages and found 21 golden tips.

Read to get more conversions:

Tip:  
Make everything easily clickable

Explanation:  
Reachability is a huge problem on mobile. If your items are all in the middle, or all too far to the left, it can be harder to click them. Make it easy to take action.

Example:

Tip:  
Give me quick context

Explanation:  
This is huge for eComm especially. If you have key info, display it above the fold. Don't make me scroll or guess to find out what I need.

Example:

Tip:  
Don't hide social proof

Explanation:  
Sometimes logos and testimonials get hidden on mobile sites. NO! You need this on all formats to help you convert.

Example:

Tip:  
Get me to the magic moment

Explanation:  
Give direct invitations to take action that make sense and meet me where I'm at. The quicker I see the product, the more likely I fall in love.

Example:

Tip:  
Use highly legible fonts

Explanation:  
If no one can read your site, no one will convert. Avoid fancy fonts and stick to accessible designs.

Example:

Tip:  
Let imagery shine

Explanation:  
Visuals add immense value on mobile. Make them crisp and high quality. Bonus points for adding photos of humans using your product.

Example:  
[@feat\_clothing](https://twitter.com/feat_clothing) [![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnUFVVIAIxnL3.jpg)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnUFVVIAIxnL3.jpg)

Tip:  
Optimize feature sections

Explanation:  
Make sure your features section isn't cramped on mobile. Use simple blocks to show your product features in an easy, can't-miss way.

Example:  
[@gumroad](https://twitter.com/gumroad) [![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnUq_VIAY7Wq_.jpg)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnUq_VIAY7Wq_.jpg)

Tip:  
Categorize your content

Explanation:  
Adding categories like "Mens" and "Womens" clothing helps me eliminate multiple clicks to get where I wanna go.

Example:  
[@Gymshark](https://twitter.com/Gymshark) [![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnVQVUcA4XBTw.jpg)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnVQVUcA4XBTw.jpg)

Tip:  
Show me the product

Explanation:  
Show the product in action as soon as humanly possible. If you can show the value before ever having to click, you've won half the battle.

Example:  
[@heyhey](https://twitter.com/heyhey) [![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnV32VcAgK5mf.jpg)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnV32VcAgK5mf.jpg)

Tip:  
Give me a sneak peek

Explanation:  
Customers love seeing content before having to sign up. Show me something that feels exclusive that I'd get on the inside. I'll be more likely to make an account.

Example:  
[@IndieHackers](https://twitter.com/IndieHackers) [![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnWd2VUAE2G4i.jpg)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnWd2VUAE2G4i.jpg)

Tip:  
Display micro-delights

Explanation:  
Small, delightful interactions can make a world of difference on mobile. This creates a premium, yet friendly feel that changes brand perception.

Example:  
[@intercom](https://twitter.com/intercom) ![](https://pbs.twimg.com/tweet_video_thumb/E5xnXApVUAE5oBL.jpg)

Tip:  
Make the menu insanely easy

Explanation:  
You don't need the master menu on mobile. Give me what I can reasonably do on a phone, eliminate all else. Simple menus = happier navigation = more conversions.

Example:

Tip:  
Use vertical step-by-steps

Explanation:  
Don't try to replicate your fancy horizontal desktop step-by-step. Make it intuitive by stacking elements on top of each other.

Example:  
[@trylolli](https://twitter.com/trylolli) [![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnYFaVcAsuMVP.jpg)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnYFaVcAsuMVP.jpg)

Tip:  
Use chat-like announcements

Explanation:  
It never hurts to make the experience feel like other phone functions. Make announcements with chat bubbles or other familiar mobile designs.

Example:

Tip:  
Let your copy shine

Explanation:  
Not the world's most visual product? Rely heavily on great copy instead. Format copy to fit your customer's needs. Say who it's for, what it does, and why they should care.

Example:  
[@Pipe](https://twitter.com/pipe) [![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnZNkVgAUqUUB.jpg)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnZNkVgAUqUUB.jpg)

Tip:  
Don't go overboard on content design

Explanation:  
Your blog doesn't need to have crazy design and intricate features. A list of articles is actually way easier to navigate, and cuts down on time to value.

Example:  
[@Public](https://twitter.com/public) [![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnZ0ZVoAIzuEk.jpg)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnZ0ZVoAIzuEk.jpg)

Tip:  
Highlight customers

Explanation:  
Stack testimonials on your home page. People need to see that other people like them enjoy the product. Don't hide these from mobile users!

Example:  
[@RoamResearch](https://twitter.com/RoamResearch) [![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnaZ-UUAEYazs.jpg)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnaZ-UUAEYazs.jpg)

Tip:  
Give me all the power

Explanation:  
Mobile sites shouldn't feel like lesser versions. You may have to stack elements and you'll have less room. But give me the premium features you give to desktop users as well.

Example:  
[@Tesla](https://twitter.com/Tesla) [![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnbEsVUAQGaNh.jpg)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnbEsVUAQGaNh.jpg)

Tip:  
Give me clear direction

Explanation:  
A single focus or CTA is usually the best way to go. If you make it easy to know what you expect me to click on, I'm more likely to click on it. Period.

Example:  
[@TheHustle](https://twitter.com/TheHustle) [![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnbq4VcAIYn7Z.jpg)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnbq4VcAIYn7Z.jpg)

Tip:  
Contrast and embolden

Explanation:  
The final CTA on your page is a good spot to mix things up. Use contrasting colors and a bold button to invite users to take action one final time.

Example:  
[@Unbounce](https://twitter.com/unbounce) [![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xncRzVgA0o-0g.jpg)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xncRzVgA0o-0g.jpg)

Tip:  
Sprinkle CTAs

Explanation:  
Every other section should have a focused CTA. The more this aligns with the main CTA in the hero, the better. Don't forget to remind people what you expect them to click on!

Example:  
[@webflow](https://twitter.com/webflow) [![](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnc1VVUAI9DtG.jpg)](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E5xnc1VVUAI9DtG.jpg)
