- I prefer to make a mistake in price than a mistake in the business quality or management quality
- **Having to do a sales job is not avoidable. It is your job to sell yourself to everybody. To your boss, to your coworkers, to your clientsâ€¦ You have to be good at it.** You're not going to just pick stocks. 
- Take example on Bill Ackman (not his picks, but how well he presents and how convincing he is.) If you come across as insecure, no one is going to give you any money. *"I am going from here to there, and i am going there whether or not you are joining me on the path."*

- The two value-added parts of the business are getting the money(sales) and compounding the money (CIO). The rest comes second rank, even if it is also very important (good traders, operations, ...)

>We never sell our CAGR, which is a good thing. The numbers are good, but we don't sell them, We sell people, philosophy and process. And we do that because the numbers are not always going to be there. Especially in a concentrated portfolio where we have these disconnects with the market. if people are focused on the numbers as sort of the lead hook, that's what they're going to focus on all the time. The conversations are going to be around every month or quarter that the numbers are not working out for them. And so, our best results with longterm relationships and clients have been those that have bought into people, philosophy and process. if those are good, the score should take care of itself. Results are made on the pitch, not on the score board.
