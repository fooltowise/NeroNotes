# Shifting Operating Cash Flows to Other Sections

### Inflating CFFO with boomerang transactions

- Be at the lookout for boomerang transactions: one part will usually be in the CFFO section while the offsetting part will be either in the investing or financing cash outflows.

### Improperly capitalizing normal operating costs

- Recording normal operating costs as a capital asset rather than as an expense
- Rapidly growing soft asset accounts (prepaid expense, other assets...) may be a sign of aggressive capitalization
- Pay attention to FCF as well

### Recording the purchase of inventory as an investing outflow

- Ex: Back in the days Netflix would reflect its DVD inventory expense as a capital expenditure rather than an operating expense
- Consider differences in accounting policies when comparing competitors
- Question any investing outflow that sounds like a normal cost of operations

### Shifting operating cash outflows off the statement of cash flows

- Ex: in 2011 Diageo funded its UK pension plan scheme  with Â£535 million of whiskey, avoiding to use precious cash flows.  As the whiskey ages, its value would increase, improving the funded status of the plan.
