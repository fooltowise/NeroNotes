Competitive advantages based on [[Economies of Scale]] usually rely on the fact that the incumbent can spread its fixed costs over a larger number of units, hence he has a lower total cost per unit and bigger profit.

What is important is to realize that these economies of scale depend on the market share, not the market size. What the incumbent want is that his competitor defends a smaller market share so he realizes lower profits per unit.

**If the total market size becomes too big, it is likely that all players will have access to enough customers to get comparable market shares.** At this point the cost structure of each player is roughly the same and the competitive advantage disappears.

Example:
Consider two companies, competing in a market in which fixed costs are $100'000 a year. If the entrant has sales of $500'000 and the incumbent $2'500'000, then fixed costs consume 20% of the entrant's revenue versus 4% of the incumbent's, a gap of 16%. Now the market doubles in size, and each company doubles as well. The gap in fixed cost as a percentage of sales decline to 8%. At a level 10 times the original, the gap drops to 1.6 percent. 

**Keep also in mind that the relevant market is the area - either geographic or in product lines - where the fixed costs stay fixed.**
