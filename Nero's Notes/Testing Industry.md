# Testing Industry
The testing industry is often another example of [[Agency Business Model]] where the paying customer does not actually choose the service.

Labtest is the Hong Kong subsidiary of [[Intertek and SGS| Intertek]], a company listed on the London stock exchange. the company's role is to serve as a gatekeeper between Chinese consumer goods manufacturers and American retailers.

US firms select Labtest to check the prototypes of new Chinese products to ensure that they meet the appropriate specifications. Intertek charges the Chinese firms, rather than the US retailers, for this service, a fee that constitutes a relatively low proportion of the product's price (less than 1% of the manufacturer's cost).

**The distancing of payer from the service selector lies at the heart of Labtest's remarkable profitability** (with margins around 33%), alongside more obvious network and scale effects.
