# Shift the burden to the Intervenor

## Description:

This behavior happens when a solution to a systemic problem reduces or disguises symptoms, but does nothing to solve the underlying problem. Whether it is a substance that dulls the perception of the individual or a policy hiding the underlying problem, the drug of choice interferes with actions that could solve the real problem.

If the intervention designed to solve the issue leads to an erosion of the self-maintenance capacity of the original system, then a destructing reinforcing loop is created. The system becomes more and more dependent to intervention, and less and less able to maintain its desired state.

## Solution:

Once again, the best way to escape this trap is to never get in. Pay attention to policies that relieve symptoms or that do not really address the problem.

Take the focus off short-term relief, and put it on long-term restructuring.
