# Gold Standards
There are certain companies that customers simply accept as the gold standard in an industry. A conspicuous example is the debt rating industry, where investors and regulators rely upon a handful of firms, dominated by Moody's Investors Service and Standard and Poor's Corporation, to rate bonds. They charge significant fees, paid by debt issuers, for ratings that simplify investor analysis. Also designed to bring order to credit markets, the industry's stability and related barriers to entry are illustrated by the fact that it survived, basically intact, despite considerable rating errors in the years leading up to the financial crisis of 2008.
