# The Three Disciplines of Stoicism

> All you need are these: certainty of judgment in the present moment; action for the common good in the present moment; and an attitude of a gratitude in the present moment for anything that comes your way. 
Marcus Aurelius, _Meditations_

The three essential parts of Stoic Philosophy are:
- Control your perceptions (What is in my control?)
- Direct your actions properly (Do what is in your control to reach your purpose)
- Willingly accept what is outside your control.
