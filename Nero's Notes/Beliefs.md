# Beliefs

When we adopt a belief, we should always ask **what are the anticipations in sensory experiences that this belief induces.** If the belief is true, what should we expect to experience? **Even better, what should we expect to never experience? (i.e, what would falsify this belief?).** What the belief forbids constrains the world. If the belief does not constrain the world in anyway, then it allows anything to happen to us. 

Those beliefs that are not related to any anticipation of sensory experience of what should happen or not happen are called *floating beliefs*. It is a unique feature of the human brain that we can model what we do not see. We then go on about elaborating sophisticated models about how we think the world works, but as long as these models and beliefs don't create an anticipation of what we should experience, these beliefs are floating. 

Example: "Fire come from a substance called *phlogiston*" is a theory that was often use in the past. The problem is that it was always explaining things after the fact: "I have seen a fire, therefore some phlogiston must have been present." However, it never made any prediction about what we should experience. *Is there phlogiston? If yes, should i expect fire?*



When I say "I think A because of B", this is a logical equivalent to B=>A. When applied to the belief world, 

- B is the belief
- A is the anticipation that i expect because of the belief

Which means that if A does not occur, then (Not A)=> (Not B) and the belief B is falsified.

Example: If someone says "I do not believe AI is possible because only God can make a soul", this person is saying: "My belief is that only God can make a soul, therefore i anticipate that AI is not possible". If someone can create an AI, then the belief of the person has been falsified and his religion is likely to be false.
