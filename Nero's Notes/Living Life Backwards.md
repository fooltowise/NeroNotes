**SHANE:** Just think of your life. We’re living life forward, but in reality, you should live life backwards. And that means sort of like pitching yourself at 90 and sitting on a park bench and it’s like, “What does my life look like? How have I treated the people in it? What matters to me in this moment?” And then living your life towards that direction versus living your life unconsciously in the best direction for tomorrow. **You want to optimize for your life. You don’t want to optimize for tomorrow.** And those things, often the decisions are the same, but often they’re very different. What’s going to matter to you towards the end of your life isn’t probably what matters to you tomorrow. But what matters to you tomorrow, it can affect the end of your life. So you have to sort of live with the end in mind. I think that was like Stephen Covey had said that. We sort of call it living backwards.


**CLAIRE:** Yeah, I love that framing of it.

**SHANE:** You have to let the hindsight of your 90-year old self become your foresight today and then make choices with that in mind. And it means you’re probably going to go home and spend more time with your family or you’re going to take time to celebrate little milestones. It changes sort of like how you think.

**CLAIRE:** Absolutely. And I think it’s funny the sort of unintentional consequence that comes when you put situations in that greater perspective and then that sort of backwards lens of I think you make better decisions. Because you’re not optimizing for, again, sort of that when tomorrow. You are a little bit more thoughtful, you have a little bit more space, you see how they sort of stack up in the long term view. It’s something that your competitors, as you were saying, can’t do as easily. And so, it’s just funny how it actually serves you right to do something that doesn’t always feel like it’s [inaudible] of the beginning.

**SHANE:** Well, my belief and I mean, is that **you live a more meaningful and satisfying life if you live backwards**. The flip side of this is like I’m super ambitious and I have a lot of drive and a lot of energy to apply towards problems. And those two things, they’re not necessarily mutually exclusive. It just means keeping in mind where is it you’re trying to go long-term and are you making the decisions today that are going to get you there? One example of this in personal life that I was just talking with a friend about at lunch today was another super ambitious person runs a company with like 75 people. And what’s suffering right now is his relationship with his wife because he’s like, “I’m exhausted. And as Esther would say, like I’m giving her the leftovers. And then after the kids get to bed, I don’t even want to have the talk. I just really want to go to bed.” But he’s not investing today. This is where this comes in. He’s not investing today on what matters to him because he feels like it’s always going to be there. And it’s not always going to be there if you don’t invest in it and it will go away and then you’ll wake up too late realizing that and it’ll immediately hit you. Like, “Man, that that 15 to 20 minutes of connection time that I thought was a chore actually was probably the thing that I’m going to regret not doing because it was so meaningful to where I wanted to be in life. And it doesn’t matter how much money or how successful this company is, that’s what I’m going to hold on to. And that’s what I can change today.” And one of the ways to help people see that is sort of living life backwards.

**CLAIRE:** I love it. You are giving me such personally a powerful reminder of viewing, not just sort of my role as a CEO, but really personally. And where we want to be in that ultimate view.

**SHANE:** This is interesting, too. I don’t project my view onto other people, but the way that I see the world is not me as a founder of a company and me as a person, it’s like I have one life, and that life includes all of these things and they have to work — and I don’t think of it in terms of balance. I think of it in terms of harmony.

**CLAIRE:** Right. Integration.

**SHANE:** I don’t want to optimize one area of my life at the expense of another area. **I only get one life. And so, that life has to work. And if my things at home aren’t good, then the things at work aren’t going to be good. And if my health isn’t good, none of that’s going to be good.** So if I’m not doing the things that I need to do in all areas of my life, then maybe I’m optimizing for tomorrow, but I’m definitely not optimizing for sort of 90 years.
