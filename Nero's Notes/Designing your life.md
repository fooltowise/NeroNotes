### Introduction
- *Engineering problems* are problems for which we have data and we are sure what is the best solution. *Designing problems* occurs when we have no idea in advance of what the solution will be like. You have a desired outcome but no clear solution in sight. Life is mostly composed of designing problems.
- *A well-designed life is a life that is generative - it is constantly creative, productive, changing, evolving, and there is always the possibility of surprise.*
- We have all been asked "What do you want to be when you grow up?" This is the fundamental question of life - whether we are fifteen or fifty. Designers love questions, but what they really love is reframing questions. 
- The reframe for the question "What do you want to be when you grow up?" is this: "Who or what do you want to grow into?" Life is all about growth and change. It's not static.
- Designers don't think their way forward. They **build** their way forward. It means you are not going to be dreaming up a lot of fun fantasies that have no relationship to the real world - or the real you. You are going to build things (we call them prototypes), try stuffs, and have a lot of fun in the process.
- Research shows that, for most people, passion comes *after* they try something, discover they like it, and develop mastery - not before. See [[Deliberate Practice | So good they can't ignore you]]
- A well designed life is a life that makes sense. It's a life in which who you are, what you believe, and what you do all line up together. A well-designed life is a marvelous portfolio of experiences, of adventures, of failures that taught you important lessons, of hardships that made you stronger and helped you know yourself better, and of achievements and satisfactions.
- The five building blocks of life design are **curiosity, bias to action, reframing, awareness, and radical collaboration**
