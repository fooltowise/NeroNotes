### Introduction
- *Engineering problems* are problems for which we have data and we are sure what is the best solution. *Designing problems* occurs when we have no idea in advance of what the solution will be like. You have a desired outcome but no clear solution in sight. Life is mostly composed of designing problems.
- *A well-designed life is a life that is generative - it is constantly creative, productive, changing, evolving, and there is always the possibility of surprise.*
- We have all been asked "What do you want to be when you grow up?" This is the fundamental question of life - whether we are fifteen or fifty. Designers love questions, but what they really love is reframing questions. 
- The reframe for the question "What do you want to be when you grow up?" is this: "Who or what do you want to grow into?" Life is all about growth and change. It's not static.
- Designers don't think their way forward. They **build** their way forward. It means you are not going to be dreaming up a lot of fun fantasies that have no relationship to the real world - or the real you. You are going to build things (we call them prototypes), try stuffs, and have a lot of fun in the process.
- Research shows that, for most people, passion comes *after* they try something, discover they like it, and develop mastery - not before. See [[Deliberate Practice | So good they can't ignore you]]
- A well designed life is a life that makes sense. It's a life in which who you are, what you believe, and what you do all line up together. A well-designed life is a marvelous portfolio of experiences, of adventures, of failures that taught you important lessons, of hardships that made you stronger and helped you know yourself better, and of achievements and satisfactions.
- The five building blocks of life design are **curiosity, bias to action, reframing, awareness, and radical collaboration**

## Chapter 1 - Start where you are
- Problem finding + Problem Solving = Well-Designed life
- How often do we fall in love with our first idea and then refuse to let it go? No matter how badly it turns out. More important, do we really think it is a good idea to let our earnest but misguided seventeen-year-old self determine where we work for the rest of our lives? How often do we check in with ourselves to see if we are really working on the right problem?
- "I need a better job" is not the solution to the problem "I am not happy working, and I'd rather be home with my kids."
- **Beware of gravity problems**. In life design, **If it's not actionable, it's not a problem.** It's a situation, a circumstance, a fact of life. It may be a drag (so to speak), but, like gravity, it's not a problem that can be solved.
- Create a dashboard with four gauges: Health, Work, Play, and Love. Write a few sentences about how it's going in each of the four areas. Mark where you are (0 to Full) on each gauge. Ask yourself if there's a design problem you'd like to tackle in any of these areas. Now ask yourself if your "problem" is a gravity problem.

## Building a compass
Our goal for your life is rather simple: *coherency*. A coherent life is one lived in such a way that you can clearly connect the dots between three things:
- Who you are
- What you believe
- What you are doing

1. Write a short reflection about your Workview. This should take about thirty minutes. Shoot for about 250 words  - less than a page of typed writing.
2. Write a short reflection about your Lifeview. This should also take non more than thirty minutes and be 250 words or so.
3. Read over your Lifeview and Workview and answer each of these questions:
	1. Where do your views on work and life complement one another?
	2. Where do they clash?
	3. Does one drive the other? How?

## Wayfinding
Wayfinding is the ancient art of figuring out where you are going when you don't actually know your destination. For wayfinding, you need a compass and you need a direction. Not a map - a direction. Since there's no *one* direction in life, you can't put your goal into your GPS and get the turn-by-turn directions for how to get there. What you can do is pay attention to the clues in front of you, and make your best way forward with the tools you have at hand. We think the first clues are ***[[Engagement - Flow]]*** and ***[[Personal Energy]]***.


What make work fun? It's not what you might think. It's not one unending office party. It's not getting paid a lot of money. It's not having multiple weeks of paid vacations. Work is fun when you are actually leaning into your strengths and are deeply engaged and energized by what you're doing.

**The Good Time Journal**
1. Complete a log of your daily activities, using the worksheet provided or in your own notebook. Note when you are engaged and/or energized and what you are doing during those times. Try to do this daily, or at least every few days.
2. Continue this daily logging for three weeks.
3. At the end of each week, jot down your reflections - notice which activities are engaging and energizing, and which ones are not.
4. Are there any surprises in your reflections?
5. Zoom in and try to get even more specific about what does or does not engage and energize you.
6. Use the AEIOU method (activity, environment, interactions, objects, users) as needed to help you in your reflections.


## Getting unstuck

Some people feel defeated because they thought that all they could do is what they had always done - and because they are not thinking like a designer. Designers know that you never go with your first idea. Designers know that when you choose from lots of options you choose better. Many people get stuck trying to make their first idea work.

**Dysfunctional Belief:** *I'm stuck.*
**Reframe:** *I'm never stuck, because I can always generate a lot of ideas.*
**Dysfunctional Belief:** *I have to find the one right idea.*
**Reframe:** *I need a lot of ideas so that I can explore any number of possibilities for my future.*

When we have no other idea other than to keep on doing what we are doing, we are stuck.

Most people do the following when they need work: they look at the job listings and look for a job they think they can get. This is one of the worst ways to get a job, and actually has the lowest rate of success. This way of thinking is not design thinking, it's just grasping whatever might be in reach, and it's unlikely to result in long-term satisfaction.


Designers get stuck all the time. Being stuck can be a launching pad for creativity. When you think like a designer, you know how to ideate - how to "flare" - to come up with lots of options for lots of possible outcomes.

You can't know what you want until you know what you *might* want, so you are going to have to generate a lot of ideas and possibilities.

Accept the problem.
Get stuck.
Get over it, and ideate, ideate, ideate!

### Ideate This

We're going to ask you to get out of the box of being realistic and venture into the wide world of "what i might want." It's time to embrace being stuck. We're all stuck in some way in some areas of our lives. That's where we need ideation, which is a fancy word for coming up with lots of ideas. Wild ideas. Crazy ideas. We're going to teach you how to have more ideas than you ever thought possible. So many people get stuck chasing their first idea, or the perfect idea, or that one big idea that will solve the problem, will be the answer, and will dig them out of whatever hole they are currently stuck in. That's lot of pressure. Believing that there's only one idea out there leads to a lot of pressure and indecision.
"I'm just not sure."
"I don't want to blow it."
"I really need to get this right."
"If I just had a better (the right, a killer) idea, then all would be well".
Let's stop right here, so we can be the first to tell you an amazing fact: all will be well.

Those of us fortunate enough to live in the modern world with access to some degree of choice, freedom, mobility, education, and technology spend most of our time immersed in a world obsessed with optimization. There's always to be a better idea, a better way - even a best way. That kind of thinking is dangerous to life design. The truth is that all of us have more than one life in us. When we ask our students, "How many lifetimes' worth of living are there in you?", the average is 3.4. And if you accept this idea - that there are multiple great designs for your life, though you'll still only get to live one - it is rather liberating. There is no one idea for your life. There are many lives you could live happily and productively (no matter how many years old you are), and there are lots of different paths you could take to lice each of those productive, amazingly different lives. So do the math, this adds up to tons of different possible ideas you might have. And we're going to give you the tools to generate such ideas.

Quantity has a quality all its own. In life design, more is better, because more ideas equal access to better ideas, and better ideas lead to a better design. Expanding you thinking improves your ability to ideate and allows for more innovation. If you work through lots of ideas, your chances of hitting on some that can be really energizing  for you go up, which increases your chance of creating something that can work and that you'll love. More ideas also equal new insights.

Designers love to ideate broadly and wildly. They love the crazy ideas as much or more than the sensible ones. They learn to to have lots of wild ideas because they know that **the number one enemy of creativity is judgment.** 

Our brains are so tightly wired to be critical, find problems, and leap to judgment tat it's a wonder any ideas ever make it out! We have to defer judgment and silence the inner critic if we want to get all our ideas out. If we don't, we may have a few good ideas, but the majority will have been lost - silently imprisoned behind the wall  of judgment our prefrontal cortex has erected to safeguard us from making mistakes and looking foolish. Now, we love the prefrontal cortex and wouldn't be caught in public without it, but we don't want it taking our ideas hostage prematurely. If we can get out into the wild idea space, then we know we've overcome premature judgment. The crazy ideas may not be the ones we pick (and rarely are, actually), but often after having the crazy ideas, we have moved to a new creative space, and we can see new an innovative possibilities that can work.

So let's bring on the crazy.

As a life designer, you need to embrace two philosophies:
1. **You choose better when you have lots of good ideas to choose from.**
2. **You never choose your first solution to any problem.**

Our minds are generally lazy and like to get rid of problems as quickly as possible, so they surround first ideas with a lot of positive chemicals to make us "fall in love" with them. Do not fall in love with your first idea. This relationship almost never works out. Most often, our first solutions are pretty average and not very creative. Humans have a tendency to suggest the obvious first. Learning to use great ideation tools helps you overcome this bias toward the obvious and helps you regain a sense of creative confidence.

Even those of you who might think that you are not creative can probably remember back a time when you didn't feel this way. Perhaps it was in kindergarten, or first or second grade, when singing, dancing, and drawing seemed like natural forms of self-expression, You were not self-conscious, nor were you judging whether your drawings were art, or your singing professional, or your dancing worthy of others' attention. You felt free to create any natural form of your own self-expression without limits.

Let's rediscover it.

### Stuck on steroid: Anchor problems

There's a certain class of problems - the ones that just won't go away - that we call anchor problems. Like a physical anchor, they hold us in one place and prevent motion.. They keep us stuck, much as Grant and Sharon were stuck with their career problems. If we are going to practice good life design, it is important to notice when we are stuck with an anchor problem.

**We are anchored to a problem because we are anchored to the one and only solution we are willing to accept.**

**The only way to get un-anchored from this immovable situation is to reframe the solution and prototype a little.**
Don't make a doable problem into an anchor problem by wedding yourself irretrievably to a solution that just isn't working. Reframe the solution to some other possibilities, prototype those ideas (take some test hikes), and get yourself unstuck. Anchor problems keep us stuck because we can only see one solution - the one  we already have that doesn't work.  Anchor problems are not only about our current, failed approach. They are really about the fear that, no matter what else we try, that won't work either, and then we'll have to admit that  we're permanently stuck - meaning we're screwed, and we'd rather be stuck than screwed, Sometimes it is more comfortable to hold on to our familiar, failed approach to the problem than to risk a worse failure by attempting the big changes that we think will be required to eliminate it. This is a pretty common but paradoxical human behavior. Change is always uncertain, and there is no guarantee of success, no matter how hard you try. It makes sense to be fearful. The way forward is to reduce the risk (and the fear) of failure by designing a series of small prototypes to test the waters. It is okay for prototypes to fail - they are supposed to - but well-designed prototypes teach you something about the future.

Prototypes lower your anxiety, ask interesting questions, and get you data about the potential of the change that you are trying to accomplish. One of the principles of design thinking is that you want to "fail fast and fail forward" into your next step. When you're stuck with an anchor problem, try reframing the challenge as an exploration of possibilities (instead of trying to solve your huge problem in one miraculous leap), then decide to try a series of small, safe prototypes of the change you'd like to see happen. it should result in getting unstuck and finding a more creative approach to your problem. We will talk a lot more about prototyping later.

Before we leave the topic of anchor problems entirely, we need to make clear how they differ from the gravity problems. They are both really nasty problem types that keep people stuck, but they're entirely different in nature. An anchor problem is a real problem, just a hard one. It's actionable - but we've been stuck on it  so long or so often that it seems insurmountable (which is why such a problem has to be reframed, then opened up  with new ideas, then knocked down to size by prototyping). Gravity problems aren't actually problems. They're circumstances that you can do nothing to change. There is no solution to a gravity problem - only acceptance and redirection. You can't defy the laws of nature, nor do we live in a world where poets reliably make a million dollars a year. Life designers know that if a problem isn't actionable, then it's not solvable. Designers may be artful at reframing and inventing, but they know better than to go up against the laws of nature or the marketplace.

We want to have lots of ideas and lots of options.
When we have lots of ideas, we can build prototypes of our life and test them out. That's what life designers do.

**Try stuffs: Mind Mapping**
1. Review your Good Time Journal and note activities in which you were engaged, energized and in flow.
2. Choose an activity that you were engaged in, an activity that you felt highly energized from, and something you did that brought you into flow, and create three mind maps - one for each.
3. Look at the outer ring of each mind map, pick three things that jump out at you, and create a job description from them. 
4. Create a role for each job description, and draw a napkin sketch.
