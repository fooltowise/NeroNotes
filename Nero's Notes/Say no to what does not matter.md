> How many have laid waste to your life when you were not aware of what you were losing, how much was wasted in pointless grief, foolish joy, greedy desire, and social amusements - how little of your own was left to you. You will realize you were dying before your time!

Seneca, _On the Shortness of life_

I should be ruthless to what does not matter to me, and keep in mind my opportunity cost.

No to :
- invitations,
- requests,
- obligations,
- the stuffs that everyone else is doing


No to pointless emotions:
- anger
- excitement
- obsession
- distraction
- lust

What do I want from life? I should start by saying no to what i do not want, and this choice is in my control.
