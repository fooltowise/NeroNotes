 Analog semiconductor businesses like Linear Technology or Analog Devices have a much better profitability than digital semiconductor ones.
 
 - Differentiated product and company specific sticky human capital reduce market contestatbility. 
 - More diverse end market than digital. 
 
 - **An analog semiconductor chip plays a very important role in a product (ex: airbag crash sensor) but present a very small proportion of the cost of materials.**
 - Once a chip has been designed into an application - a process on which the original equipment manufacturer and the analog company often collaborate - it is costly for the manufacturer to replace it, as the whole production process has to be revised. **Hence [[Switching costs]] are high**, both improving pricing power over the product lifecycle (often ten years or more) and the degree to which revenues are recurring.
