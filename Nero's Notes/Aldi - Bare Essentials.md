## Business Principles
### Concept, Idea, Vision
Everything starts here. This rules the company and shapes it down to the last detail. A clear strategy and clear goals are the basis of any convincing business policy.

### Assortment Structure
A decisive retail function was always the product range function, i.e the composition of items or offering inclusive services to the customer, oriented towards the presumed expectations of the potential customers. The entrepreneur decides first as a representative of his customers. He preselects. In doing this he has assumed the function of composing the product range. The customers can trust his selection, his qualities and his choice between various alternative options such as Maggi or Knorr in instant soups. Making this selection, this decision, requires courage. Not presenting the same products several times just because there are different names and brands available.  Aldi follows this principle of keeping the number of items down to an absolute minimum, and offering as many different kinds as possible. The assortment structure, the selection of items, is carried out independent of suppliers' terms and conditions and prices.

### Price policy and costs
Low prices are always advantageous for customers independent of market conditions and what the competition is doing. Low prices are the point. The lowest possible costs are the absolute prerequisite.

### Advertising
Informative and trust-building.

### Business Partners
Treat them as you want to be treated yourself. Live and let live.
