# People Hate Uncertainty

A core feature of the human species is that people hate uncertainty. 

For instance, ask yourself which message on a flight departure board would distress you more: 
- Frankfurt - DELAYED
- Frankfurt - DELAYED - 70 minutes

The first one is clearly worse because we have no idea how long we are going to have to wait.

A business that can manage to reduce uncertainty in people's lives is certain to be successful.

Trying to reduce uncertainty and variance leads us to be [[Satisficing| satisficers]].
