Typically, capital is attracted into high-return businesses and leaves when returns fall below the cost of capital. This process is not static, but cyclical - there is constant flux. 
The inflow of capital leads to new investment, which over time increases capacity in the sector an eventually pushes down returns.

Conversely, when returns are low, capital exits and capacity is reduced. Over time, then, profitability recovers.

From the perspective of the wider economy, this cycle resembles Shumpeter's process of "creative destruction"- as the function of the bust, which follows the boom, is to clear away the misallocation of capital that has occurred during the upswing.
