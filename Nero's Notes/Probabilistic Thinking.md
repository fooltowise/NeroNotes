# Probabilistic Thinking
Thinking in shades of probability means roughly identifying what matters, coming up with a sense of the odds, doing a check on our assumptions, and then making a decision. We can act with a higher level of certainty in complex, unpredictable situations. 

We can never know the future with exact precision. 

Probabilistic thinking is an extremely useful tool to evaluate how the world will most likely look so that we can effectively strategize.
