# Strategies to grow your fund

See [[Create a Fund]]

## Our lessons

There were many lessons in my notes that I want to share with all as well:

### **Grow your assets**

-   **Use your network to grow your fund** = the easiest way to grow assets in the first years is via reaching to existing contacts and using your existing network. There you have already built trust and can build on that.
-   **Reference other fund managers and vice versa** = Your customers might be looking to allocate to other fund managers. Especially if they have maxed out their allocation to you they might be interested in recommendations of other fund managers. If your fund manager friends also do recommend you to their customers, this could create a win-win situation.
-   **Focus on the long-hanging fruits** = It just makes sense to go for the long-hanging fruits. Go for them first. 
-   **Focus on the investment decision makers** = If you approach the allocation decision makers you will have better chances for success. The lower levels will usually decline you.
-   **Go to where customers are** = Rotary clubs, art collectors, IHK, entrepreneur networks, business angle networks or such could be fruitful. 

### **Narrow down and focus on the areas where you can be helpful**

-   **Get a clear focus and execute it =** You are NOT Blackrock or Fidelity. So, you have to be way more focused on your approach. Get clearance on your product's value and where you can add value. Then double down on this, niche, and first and foremost, approach the contacts to whom you could add value. 
-   **Focus helps to not pay for the wrong things** = If you have a clear plan with smaller broken-down steps it also helps to make the right capital allocation decisions. 

### **Let your service providers do the work for you**

-   **Service providers like KVGen and Verwahrstellen are helpful friend**s = You can use their network and their services to get in contact with customers. At fairs, they offer spaces to rent or booths where you can meet. They have distribution power via their press contacts. They also can host your webinars or distribute your newsletter. 
-   **Stay in contact** = Reach out to your service providers from time to time. They often love it to stay in touch and maybe they have gotten better with services for you. 

### **Make sure you are listed so that people can invest in you**

-   **Don't miss out on the right listing =** The best marketing does not make sense if people can't buy your product. Make sure you are buyable. 

### **Be ready to share up to 50% of your management fee**

-   **Salespeople need to be incentivized and paid** = Even if you don't love to hear that: You have to pay salespeople that they have an interest in selling your product. If they get no kickback they have no interest in selling. To get an idea of the industry sales fee, you could use [https://rentablo.de/](https://rentablo.de/) 

### **Use LinkedIn**

-   **LinkedIn is your key tool** = LinkedIn can be a very good tool for acquiring contacts. Use the search function to search for family offices or other exciting contacts. Reach out to people via chat to invite them to events. 
-   **Invite people via the message function** = Send people messages with invites. It could help if they are in your target group. 
-   **Don't forget about XING** = German users from Sparkassen and Volksbanken still use it. Also, be present and approachable there. 

### **Continuity**

-   **Keep on being there =** Show your presence regularly and over the long term. Reaching out once is like never reaching out. Keep on communicating and reaching out.
-   **Plan a day or a slot on a few days for "marketing"** = Making reaching out a habit makes sense—reserve one day a week or specific time slots for marketing and contacting potential investors. 
-   **Fridays suck** = Don't go for Friday as your reaching-out day. Especially if you target institutions. There your success rate will be low. 

### **Cold calls**

-   **Cold calling are part of the game** = You have to use the telephone super often. And you have to get used to it so that your cold calls will be rejected. You have to get used to doing cold calls till your "finger bleed." 

### **Roadshows**

-   **Do the follow-up work**: The worst thing you could do after the roadshow is to miss out on the follow-up work. Customers don't reach out to you. You must use the contracts to contact the customers as part of your follow-up work. 
-   **Use the roadshows of other managers** = This is a bit of a particular recommendation, but you could use the local roadshow of other competitors to acquire contacts. Being there for 2 hours allows you to network and get contacts you usually won't get.
-   **Don't expect too much** = roadshows might not perform well after the pandemic. Do some creative work and don't expect too much when setting them up.

### **Mailing**

-   **Use the opportunities of mailing tools =** Many investors waste a lot of opportunities. A form to subscribe to your mailing list should be on every website. MailerLite can provide this for a few € [https://www.mailerlite.com/invite/837fd3ed524a5](https://www.mailerlite.com/invite/837fd3ed524a5) and let's you grow your mailing infrastructure efficiently and cheaply.
-   **Use the power of automation** = Mail programs let you create automatic mail series. So, you could create a welcome tunnel to build trust with your subscribers. For instance, you can send three emails. One to welcome them and explain the most crucial thing the subscribers should know. In the second, you can add more details. In the third mail, you can invite the subscriber to reach out to you, for instance, with a Zoom call. 
-   **Use professional mail builders** = Most investor mail have flaws or content shown twice. Use a professional mail builder and create a great mail experience. 

### **Be approachable**

-   Being approachable = Your advantage as a smaller fund manager is being approachable. This is a wildcard for you, and if you can keep this service while scaling, it can become a moat. If people can reach you, it could be a reason why they buy your product. 
-   **Calendly =** Depending on your target group, having a [https://calendly.com/de](https://calendly.com/de) on your website could help. So, you could get new contacts via the tool. 

### **Institutional investors**

-   **It takes time** = As a fund starter, it takes time to build a track record and be a target for institutional investors. So, you can take some time before reaching out to institutional investors. But some institutions could help you as they have Emerging Managers programs. 

### **Journalists**

-   **Be helpful to press contacts =** It can help if you provide your press contacts with helpful information. They have limited capabilities to do their work and research. Having you as a valuable source could help. 
-   **Florian Bamberg =** Florian Bamberg recently started to write beneficial stuff on dealing with the press [https://www.linkedin.com/in/flobam/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/flobam/)
-   **Mark Böschen** = Mark Böschen could also be a helpful press contact interested in good stories. 

### **Podcasts**

-   **Use the power of podcasts** = There are helpful podcasters in the community that could help produce content, like  [Rainer Gehler](https://plus.good-investing.net/u/18585c75?show_back_link=true)  and  [Tim Senger](https://plus.good-investing.net/u/1eb96335?show_back_link=true) . You could use the podcasts you have to get another level of engagement with potential investors. 
-   **Quality** = Getting good quality for podcasts is not heard with this guide [https://plus.good-investing.net/c/deals/2-quality-audio-podcasting](https://plus.good-investing.net/c/deals/2-quality-audio-podcasting)

### **Social Media**

-   **Don't be shy to recycle** = You should use your content on social media more than one time. Don't be scared to recycle or retweet. For instance, you can make 2-5 content pieces from your letter - not just one post. Or you could use event content or more for your purpose. 
-   **Webinars** = Webinars could be an excellent way to collect contact data to reach out to people after the webinar. 

### **Outsource**

-   **Interns** = You could outsource some of the tasks to interns. 

## **Events you could visit**
