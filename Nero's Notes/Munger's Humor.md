- When you mix raisins with turds, you've still got turds. (Comparing the benefits that the Internet and technology are providing to society versus the evils of stock speculation in these sectors).
- In the corporate world, if you have analysts, due diligence, and no horse sense, you've described hell.
- It's been so long since we've bought anything that asking us about our market impact when we're trading is like asking Rip Van Winkle about the past twenty years.
- When I first moved to California, there was a part-time legislature that was controlled by gambling interests, racetrack owners, and liquor distributors, who wined and dined the legislators, supplied them with prostitutes, etc. I think I prefer that to today's full time legislature.
