## AMA Session

- If you aren't hearing back from your audience, either that they love it or they hate it, you probably haven't found your niche yet. It might also mean that you don't have great call to action for comments.
- If you want to create an ad-based newsletter, it is very important to have good analytics, so choose a platform like ConvertKit or MailChimp - substack is horrible for analytics and sponsors care a lot about your numbers!
- Be aware that doing an ad-based newsletter will be like trying to serve two masters at once, you are likely to have a principle-agent problem. Are you sure that your product is the best for your audience?
