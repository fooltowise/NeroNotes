### AddLife is a large company with many different individual businesses. I understand the mother ship quite well but there's not much disclosure around the more recent acquisitions, so assume I know next to nothing about Healthcare 21.

Let me tell you about my background. I was part of Aquilant who ended up under the umbrella of Healthcare 21. I was general manager there for 10 years overall. I started as a sales manager, running one of the business units, slowly building my position to where I was responsible for 50% of all UK and Ireland Aquilant activities. I covered a broad sector of product groups, everything considered consumable, and in the medical device industry that relates to a commodity cost of 10 pence to £10,000. It includes everything which is single use, which could be a stent or a high-cost device, but specific to one patient and is only ever used once. That includes pulp and products used in the thousands and thrown away. I reported to the managing director who, together with the finance director, did all the work to market the company and the initial due diligence with H2, Patrick and his team. I have reasonable insight into that and remained in the new organization for nine months to help restructure and transfer the business from Aquilant management to the Healthcare 21 team. At the end, I was paid everything I was due, which was a nice way to leave.

### Was it always the plan to exit the business after a transition period?

Initially, there was a long-term commitment for me to be there, but that was dependent on further acquisitions and development happening, which probably hadn't during that timescale. You either drive sales to drive revenue growth or cut costs to improve the bottom line. Revenue growth hadn't happened as quickly, in principle, because no further acquisitions had been identified at that stage. My job became largely redundant once I transferred many of the team structures. After amalgamating the businesses, I had less to do, so it was no surprise. We had the conversation in the first month where I told them how I saw it going, I would help them restructure, then exit the business. At the time, that was not the plan but it turned out to be the actuality in the end.

### Could you dive deeper into Aquilant's types of products and customers?

Aquilant was in three geographies but, by the time of the sale, only in two as we had withdrawn from Holland. I was responsible for UK and Ireland and we covered a breadth of product. My portfolio covered true consumables, which in the Irish market, included pulp products like gowns and drapes which are commodity-based and cost-driven. Prior to joining and the bit I enjoyed the most, was looking after the interventional and surgical businesses. We had businesses in interventional cardiology and radiology and endoscopy therapy which is treatment through the endoscope. We transformed from general GI surgery, which we didn't feel was a growth market, into a women's healthcare business. Many of those were classic distributor-managed businesses, small independent manufacturers who didn't want global sales teams. We also ran several legacy businesses for people, and I personally setup the teams for Smith & Nephew and Becton Dickinson.

We managed their business which sat between a cash cow and problem child; large volume and large revenue but not a focus area of growth for their parent business. They needed us to manage them for maximum profitability over a period, without putting their own resources behind it. We did the same in Ireland for W.L. Gore. We also had endoscopy capital equipment and orthopedics businesses which were run on a different model because they are quite different in terms of selling it to the NHS and other partners. In virtually all of those, we were buying and warehousing the stock and providing the physical movement of that stock to customers including ordering and invoicing. Our expertise was the sales and marketing of those products.

### How sales intensive were these products? Were you fulfilling more of a logistics function or was there a genuine need to explain the products to customers?

They were sales-intensive and the logistics was secondary. The NHS Supply Chain is owned and managed by Supply Chain Commercial Logistics who report directly to NHS England. Following the Lord Carter report several years ago, their aim was to have 80% of the revenue of medical devices going through NHS Supply Chain. Their mixed model was for some low value, high volume commodity products, they buy the product directly from the manufacturer and subsequently warehouse and distribute it. Wound dressings would fall into the category of products I worked with. Another group are the low volume, high value products such as radiology, endoscopy and cardiology, where they administer the contract but the supplier is responsible for shipping. That marketplace is so competitive that if you are not there supporting your product, you will very quickly lose your business.

A customer could be comfortable in how to use a product, but if somebody else is in the building on the day, they might get their product used instead of yours, which is true for low volume, high value items. One of the big ways to sell cardiology and radiology products is to be in the hospital cath lab with the clinician at the time of use, and advise and guide on usage. Even though you could have a tender award saying you would get 30% of the business, you still need to have somebody in there to guarantee that. In the wound care consumables end, which is more commodified and less intensive, someone is always trying to get your business. The root cause of that is because the NHS Supply Chain typically work on frameworks. They will have an umbrella framework which a company applies to in a tender exercise. That framework gives you the right to directly sell a group of products to NHS hospitals, within the terms and conditions of this framework and the pricing you submit, but it doesn't give you any business.

Each trust or group of trusts if workers are collaborative, will run a mini competition and they have different names depending how they're run. The umbrella is a group of hospitals or a single hospital who want to buy a hundred widgets this year, each company can now put in their best offer. Their best offer will be based on price but it could also be based on value-add service. They will ultimately decide to offer their hundred widgets to several companies, at which point you have your “guaranteed business” for that period.

Once on a framework, a lot of sales activity is required at an individual hospital level with individual clinicians and procurement departments. There is a spectrum of procurement from those who want to buy to clinicians who want to use the right product for the right patient. There is also a spectrum of stakeholders in between, and the complexity of the product dictates where you are on that spectrum and which end is the most influential. You obviously need salespeople to interface with those people. These mini competitions are typically run in one to two year cycles. There are several hundred acute trusts or hospitals, each with a range of products on different frameworks. This continual sales activity is not focused on one or two accounts, a territory manager might look after 50 accounts, and at any time, two or three will be active with a purchasing process.

### What do you mean by account because it sounds like there is one umbrella organization which is the NHS, but obviously there are different entities below that?

I live in Derbyshire so Derby Royal Hospital NHS Trust would be my local hospital, which is its own business. The model the government set up was each trust is a standalone entity. The umbrella organization provides the framework agreements, which apart from putting basic pricing in, includes all legal requirements for a tender. We still seem to be under European tender rules, even post Brexit, so they provide the legal framework for that tender to be compliant under the legal tender regulations. That means the process each trust has to go through to purchase is shorter because they can focus on price and whatever the local service level agreements are, without having to do a big legal process.

### Beneath the level of the trust, you also have doctors or nurses who are using the stuff. What percentage of your products did you need to be on site explaining their use versus disposable medical gowns where they simply pick one from a cupboard?

We worked on the intensive side where they expect people to be available. That's the easiest place to leverage extra revenue from a distribution point of view. Commodity products cost little to manufacture and are sold competitively on price. For a third party to also take a slice makes it marginal as to what everybody can make. With a complex device, there's an expectation of a high cost of sale, but there's also a high unit price so there is enough room for everybody to make the margins they need. That's where it's a sales and marketing activity rather than simply box moving.

### You initially said it was mostly a consumables type business, but medical devices don't get consumed or am I misunderstanding something?

My definition of consumables is anything which is single use. The NHS class consumables as single use. If you buy a piece of equipment or a product to use once, it is a consumable.

### Would that include complex devices?

That would include a replacement hip or knee, an implantable defibrillator or a stent for the heart or leg. Many of those can cost £15,000 but they would still be considered a consumable item because it is only used once, as opposed to capital equipment which is there forever.

### Who were some of the key supplier relationships for these products?

Vascular Solutions, who were bought by Teleflex, but have now gone direct. Taeyeon Medical, a Korean company who do a lot of complex products you use through an endoscope, including GI, biliary tract and other stents into the liver and esophagus. Optimed, a German company supplied leg stents for treating diabetic patients. We also had several niche Gore products for pediatric cardiac surgery, for treating babies with holes in their hearts. The anchor agency which everything else was built around, the main revenue came from Cooper Surgical who offer general surgery in women's health. We had anchor agencies with Becton Dickinson and Smith & Nephew and we started some work which was very successful with SecurAcath, an American company who made a small product for keeping long-dwelling PICC line or midline catheters.

You might have seen people with what looks like a catheter coming out of the crook of their elbow, there's a little device to hold that in place. We actually got NHS England direct funding for that for a long time and they were our sole customer. A trust could order directly from us and we would ship it free of charge and send NHS England a monthly invoice. That was part of an initiative where they wanted to get innovative cost saving products into the market, which is often difficult because a procurement officer looks at unit cost price, not lifetime price.

Going through certain pathways with NHS England, we got them to understand that the lifetime price was significantly cheaper than the unit cost price of the competitor product. The only way they could get the hospitals to take it up was to fund it centrally. That is some of the work we would do as a distributor. Innovation is odd because all new products are innovation, but for the NHS it has to change the patient pathway or outcome. They won't give you funding for another bell or whistle on an existing product.

### How dependent is Aquilant on any one of these larger suppliers?

> Some exited and we were never wholly dependent but some of them hurt. The way we structured the company was each product area had its own team, which is partly because of the intensive nature of working with them in hospitals. You need product area experts and a large number of people. From a purely commercial bottom line, if somebody major exited we could restructure a small part of the business and the overall impact on the group bottom line wasn't massive. It would be redundancies or restructuring, which protects because we ran each therapy area as its own business, so we were able to do that without massive disruption to the rest of the organization.

### Isn't a big part of the business when you noticed you would lose a supplier, you found a different supplier for that same product area?

It absolutely is and a big part of my role was that business development. I oversaw the teams but each of them had its own manager, I was the second or third line manager to those managers. I looked after our current suppliers to ensure they were happy. I also looked at replacement product areas where we felt vulnerable or even new or developing therapy areas we weren't in but felt we had enough synergy to enter and find manufacturer partners in those areas. One of the beauties of being a distributor is when we had opportunities, we could build a new team if we needed to, so we could create a new business area. That's exactly what we did for Smith & Nephew where we built a new team and added further products to their portfolio.

### What was the revenue and profitability of the business at the time of sale?

Our turnover was between €90 and €100 million. We reported in euros because we were owned by an Irish company. Our EBIT on that would have been 10%.

### That sounds quite typical for the business.

Distribution margins from manufacturers vary between 30% and 50%, so you can take a blended 40%, and after cost of sales and warehousing we came out at 10%.

### Did you say the gross margins ranged from 30% to 50%?

Some were slightly less but none were particularly higher than that.

### Who were the sellers and what was their motivation to sell to H2?

Aquilant was owned by United Drug Healthcare plc, the Irish company, who were streamlining their business which consisted of three parts. One is pharmaceutical wholesaling which was very much an Irish thing although they had a joint venture in the UK with Boots. A second part of the business was services to the pharmaceutical industry, an example being Ashfield In2Focus who did contracts with pharmaceutical teams, information and medical writing and events management. They also had our part of the business which was medical device sales and distribution.

When they moved to the London Stock Market, they got the message their business was confusing. It had three different strands to it with different profit and risk profiles. A decision was taken to divest the pharmaceutical wholesaling and medical device businesses, and UD Healthcare plc only focus on services to the pharmaceutical industry today, which is low risk as they have no product ownership. They enter longish term agreements with pharmaceutical companies to provide sales, marketing and other support, which is low risk and reasonably profitable. That's how Aquilant came to be for sale.

We went through a long process of people coming to have a look, and in the end, H2 were the party who put forward the offer that was accepted. We did six months of due diligence with Patrick the fund manager and his two colleagues Rich and Ed, so that they completely understood the business. That all went well and the purchase went through early August, 2018. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but there was some issue around the heads of terms, but I completely understand what happened. The purchase went through and the following day I got a call from Patrick explaining they had rolled us straight into a deal with Healthcare 21, where H2 took 49% and Healthcare 21 took 51%. They knew they could make money out of Aquilant, but didn't know how to do it, so decided to put us straight into another organization.

There is some irony in this because part of our due diligence we did with them is identifying and profiling several acquisition targets, and Healthcare 21 was one. They took the initiative from that list and probably had their own discussions away from us. That was their prerogative but we were the managers and expected a slightly different outcome and deal, but that's water under the bridge. We weren't the owners so didn't have a say in the outcome. The managing director left on day one. Myself and the finance director stayed for a period, but we've both since exited. Our long-term aims were growth through acquisition and, potentially, a broader European footprint.

### When you say we, are you talking about Aquilant or the new group?

No, Aquilant, by rolling the organization to Healthcare 21, which was a similar size. If you took two £100 million companies and made a £200 million company, it would probably be more valuable instantly. The management of H2 took a back seat straight away because they genuinely didn't know what they would bring to the party, so finding and rolling another company in and letting them manage it worked for them.

### Was the idea that Aquilant would lead the new company rather than HC 21?

> Healthcare 21 was never in the picture until the day it was done; it was always going to be Aquilant looking for acquisitions. They saw the opportunity to do a deal with one of our acquisition targets and roll the two together in a way that worked for them financially because it minimized their outlay. Whatever they paid for Aquilant, they probably paid for Healthcare 21, but I don't know whether it was an easy option to get a 50% stake in a bigger organization which gives an instant return on investment.

### What did the Healthcare 21 business look like before Aquilant?

Healthcare 21 was an Irish distributor with an English business, whereas Aquilant had most of their revenue coming from the UK. Owen Curtin was the owner and chairman and built a nice business. David Fredericks ran the UK organization and is probably still an exec in the new organization but has exited from his day-to-day work. He had come from Covidien who were one of the main suppliers to Healthcare 21 in Ireland, and on his exit, they gave him several products to set up as a distributor. They no longer wanted to deal with them but still needed the revenue.

He set up his own business which became part of Healthcare 21 in a refinancing exercise, where the two went under one umbrella, but ran separately. Our vision at Aquilant was that it was one company and UK and Ireland worked together. One of the things that we almost undid at the time is that Healthcare 21 Ireland and UK ran independently of each other, apart from some shared services at a high level such as finance. That's the model they had when I left, and I spent a lot of time de-linking things we had made to be linked.

### Did the two UK businesses get consolidated into Aquilant and the Irish businesses into HC 21?

> Yes, and in Ireland only the HC 21 name exists today. In the UK, they still work under both and it's Aquilant, a Healthcare 21 division. There was a lot of value in the Aquilant name, particularly in the high value interventional areas, so they decided to keep that name rather than confusing the marketplace by changing it again. Those businesses were fairly separate, but ran them all as individual business units anyway. The work didn't come together until you got to a high-level manager. That structure was “reasonably easy” and is still in place today, where the businesses run under that model of a standalone business with a manager reporting into a new general manager.

### Was there overlap with therapeutic suppliers or were they complimentary?

The UK was discrete so there was very little issue but Ireland had more overlap, such that I had to have many difficult conversations with suppliers, some of whom exited because they felt they would be second fiddle for the same product.

### Does HC 21 have any differences in terms of product or therapeutic areas?

The one thing they had in Ireland which we didn't was a big contract to look after living aids such as wheelchairs and walking sticks. They had a business to put them into and manage in a community, and when they were done, they would collect and reprocess them for reuse. Beyond that, the business was similar. The UK was a little different as they had several areas which were different but complimentary to us. They had many breast implants and managed to get several big brand manufacturers with legacy area products they wanted managing. They built their business from that rather than looking for niche innovative products, which was more our model. There were strengths to both models.

I felt they were beholden to two or three manufacturers who were super critical. The time we merged was when they had the PIP breast scandal and that part of their business halved overnight as they didn't have much else supporting it. They were more vulnerable than us to any sudden changes of a partner, but equally, they had big chunks from one or two revenue streams. We had many one, two and three millions and they had two or three five millions. Their management of the business was easier but their risk of an adverse event was also greater. Adding the two together makes a balanced business. I found for both the Aquilant and Healthcare 21 business, it was very hard to make that switch to say just because we have it in the UK, we'll have it in Ireland and vice versa. That's down to market dynamics and sizes, and existing relationships. Some companies already have relationships across both geographies and don't want to change supplier, other times I'd look at things in the UK and go it really works here. The Irish market is a tenth of the size, and sometimes the scale doesn't justify the investment to make that transfer.

### Would you say the merger of the two companies made sense?

Absolutely, but the irony was that it was one of our acquisition targets. We had profiled them without understanding exactly how their business worked. We thought it was more synergistic than cannibalistic.

### How did the integration go whilst you were there?

It went reasonably well. There were some teething troubles because every manufacturing partner wants to be top dog in their area. Some manufacturers were uncomfortable on a new offering, so it wasn't always possible to retain the structures. One example of that was Cooper Surgical. At Aquilant, I was building a big team behind their product range, based on them giving us more products, but Healthcare 21 wanted to go in a different direction and merge it into a different team, which meant they wouldn't be the biggest part of that new business. It didn't happen at the time but they subsequently opted to go direct in the UK. We had arduous meetings with the owner manufacturer of SecurAcath around some changes being made, but they are still with Healthcare 21 and continuing to grow. Out of everybody that's gone, one or two were difficult to take but the others less so because they weren't growing significantly. While the business looks different because of some of those exits, it's still a good business.

### It sounds like any integration complexity was more on the side of managing those supplier relationships rather than managing the teams?

Absolutely.

### Were the teams not impacted as they could continue their day-to-day job?

They weren't impacted or they were merged. Even with Healthcare 21, we were very good at messaging those changes on what it would look like and why we were doing it. If you don't manufacture your product, your next biggest asset is your people, and that was a mantra of both companies. There was a lot of similarity between the two organizations in how people were valued and developed. Both prided themselves on internal development, many people moved from sales to management.

### Do you know what happened in subsequent years?

Prior to joining AddLife, they made two further acquisitions who were also on our target list. They bought an X-ray equipment company, and another cardiac surgery company which belonged to Mark Wooley. We had looked at both of those organizations and at the time UD Healthcare didn't want us to proceed in acquisition because they were already forming a strategy which was our divestment. They were using their acquisition capital for businesses they wanted to keep long term. Both of those were integrated and were bought to increase revenue as opposed to strategic purchases to go in a different direction or growth area. They were purchased because they were two other available companies in the UK market. If your strategy is acquisition for growth, you can only buy people who want to be sold. They had been on the market for a long time because Aquilant had looked at them. They are both nice businesses but they are not going to bring more than they brought on day one.

### How big were they, revenue wise?

Mark Wooley's company had £10 million turnover.

### Relatively small compared to the other combined group?

The other company was sub-20, 25 million because we looked at them in 2016, so it was five years after by the time they were purchased. They were trying to sell that part of their business because they invested heavily in plastic extrusion equipment for making their own medical devices, and wanted to divest distribution to focus on their manufacturing business. That was certainly our impression in 2016.

### What have you heard since the acquisition by AddLife?

David Fredericks took his package and left, but is still there as an exec. Tara Fitzgerald and Owen Curtin left and I know Nathan, who was my equivalent in the UK, is now general manager. Aside from that, the product people I speak to, it seems AddLife at their level have not created anything different.

### Their strategy is to leave the company as is; if it ain't broke, don't try fix it.

Yes, and that would make sense.

### Are the key people at the time you left still in place or has that changed?

Many of my direct reports have left. I get the impression that more of the old Healthcare 21 team are in management positions now but not across the board. Nathan is now the top man for Healthcare 21 UK and Ireland, reporting to AddLife.

### Was he formerly Aquilant or Healthcare 21?

He was Healthcare 21. After the restructuring, they only needed one UK General Manager, and he already had the Healthcare 21 badge, so I have no regrets. Beyond that, the three original owner managers are no longer in the business. David is the only one who has anything left to do with that, Owen is fully retired and Tara left.

### I think Tara is still involved as a director.

I'm sure that there will be some kind of earn out deal that keeps her there. Trevor was a young finance director who may still be there. I saw on LinkedIn that he had taken his team to an AddLife meeting, so I assume he's still FD for Healthcare 21. There has been a reasonable turnover of sales managers which is normal for a medical device company. A three-year cycle isn't unusual, so it's taking its natural course.

### What type of an owner was HC21 and how did they handle the sale to AddLife? Private equity companies can damage companies in order to boost short term earnings and get a good sales price, did H2 handle it that way or were they a responsible owner?

I'm sure they were involved but they left the management to Owen, Tara and David. All they did was turn up to the quarterly board meeting. I don't how the acquisitions were funded and capitalized, whether they put more in and took a bigger stake, or it was a joint and taken out of profits. I'm sure they were equally involved in the sale but you have to remember they were only a 49% partner.

### The three owners you mentioned owned 51% of HC 21.

They deliberately took 51% and refused to do it for less, smartly, rightly.

### The three owners?

Yes, so they would probably call the major shots. I'm sure H2 helped to put the package together when they wanted to sell the business, but they deliberately withdrew from the business, so I suspect they oversaw what was done rather than being the architects of whatever portfolio was put together.

### How much opportunity do you see for HC 21 as a group, either in terms of organic growth into new therapeutic areas or growing existing areas? Are there many target acquisitions they could potentially go for?

There are few sensible acquisitions in their markets. They could look find companies who are currently not in their sphere but there aren't many around. Uniphar, in Ireland, were competitors of UD Medical. One of our previous MDs, an Irish guy, was on the UD Medical graduate program and went so far until UD Medical got new executive level management. He was told he wouldn't make board level, so he skipped to Uniphar, but took the work UD Medical had been doing in terms of building. They have subsequently hoovered up most of acquisition targets in the UK and Ireland that were attractive, by being of size and scale. Some of them would have been an overlap and couldn't have been an acquisition, so there isn't much more to go out, unless a large owner manufacturer decide they want to get out, which only happens if you go with a big check book, which isn't a great acquisition strategy.

As for organic growth, the health services of UK and Ireland are at capacity, so procedure numbers are unlikely to grow significantly, which means the areas they're in won't grow either. They might increase their 20% market share to 25% in a specific product area, but they will probably also suffer in another area. They could expect 5% revenue growth per year if they are in a diverse area. Some areas increase procedure numbers one year while others decrease. There will always be competitive price pressure so significant revenue growth is difficult unless you have something truly different and outstanding. That leaves them looking for other products.

The beauty of working for a distributor is finding new products in different areas. That comes down to their view on investment risk. If you think you could sell £3 million of a new product in two years’ time, you will need the full team on day one to start that process because sales cycles can be long. If you need five people who each cost a hundred grand, you have half a million cost before you've sold a product. You would have spent 1.5 million in three years to get to two million sales at 50% margin. It will depend on what AddLife's view is on investment to go into genuinely new product areas. They may pick up some legacy product in the way they have in the past, which shortcuts that because it comes with preexisting revenue. They could do that but those are few and far between and are not the norm.

The norm is somebody coming out of Germany or China and saying, we've created a new this, and most of those are me toos anyway. Very little is true innovation that will change the way patients are treated in a way we can take a big market share quickly. Typically, big manufacturers create those. Medtronic will invest in many small organizations when they're doing their product developments, which makes it easy for them to acquire cheaply if the product comes to fruition because they already own 40% or 50% of them. It sounds bleak but you won't get massive returns quickly unless you get lucky.

### I'm surprised you think there's no opportunity to buy niche distribution businesses because we always hear the market is very fragmented with many niche businesses out there, but you think that's not the case?

Many of them are very small and are relationship-based, so if you get one with two or three guys, they probably have a strong relationship with a manufacturer and are at a stage where they're looking to get out of that business. I'm not saying it can't happen, but you're looking at acquisitions of sub £10 million in terms of turnover. That comes with the inherent risk of having to fit the portfolio with new management. A £200 million company has to do many £10 million acquisitions to start to move your dial because each one is only 5%.

### Slow and steady wins the race. If you could do 5% organic and 5% through acquisitions every year, you would grow at a decent clip.

It depends what your end goal is and how quickly you need to get there. I have worked for the last few years for Biotronic who were looking globally, and if they got 10%, they were happy.

### Do the sub £10 million businesses make sense to buy or is there too much key man risk that you buy it for a few million then everyone quickly walks out the door?

> You need good earn-out clauses in that agreement. I've seen many where, within a fairly short period, someone exited and started up again doing the same thing. They have to find the right targets who have built something that feels sustainable and are actively looking to get out. Two lads in their thirties who have taken it from zero to £5 million turnover might get a couple hundred thousand out annually, so will not want to sell and work for a corporate or give it all up because they see that as sustainable. You should rather find somebody in their 50s who has been in an established business and you can take it off their hands and give them an earn-out so they can walk away.

### That sounds like the best.

There's no right answer because you might phone me tomorrow and tell me you came across this company you didn't know about that looks good and would be willing to sell for the right price. You need somebody actively in that market. Part of Nathan's job might be looking at UK companies, which was certainly part of our team's business. We would look at people who might be available and say this will be a good fit. We did several where we got a reasonable way down the line but because they were owner-managed, it was very easy to say I like the numbers but don't fancy working for you.

### HC 21 recently announced they were acquiring a smaller business, O'Flynn; do you know anything about that company?

I don't know O'Flynn, but I'm guessing they're on the Irish market.

### I think it's an Irish company. Who are the main competitors for HC 21?

It's therapy-dependent. In the low volume, high value endoscopy, cardiology and radiology space, Medtronic, Boston Scientific, Abbotts and Cook.

### Those are all big OEMs with their own distribution.

Did you want distributors?

### Companies who would be competing with HC 21 for some of the suppliers.

In the cardiology radiology space in the UK, Vascular Perspectives is an owner-managed organization who are very good at what they do. They could get some investment from one of their suppliers named ASAHI, a Japanese company. Across UK and Ireland it comes under SISK who came out of the building organization, who are now all owned by Uniphar, and they have several similar offerings. Distribution opportunities are widely existing in high value, low volume intensive sales.

### If there are so few large distributors, it sounds like a lot of this is direct. The UK is one of the world's largest markets, so it makes sense for OEMs to have direct sales.

Most companies and products are direct. Those that tend to go through distributors have one offering rather than a portfolio. Medtronic are in many business areas but each area tends to have multiple products. Distribution tends to be where they'll have one or two products within a spectrum within an offering. One of the challenges we had as Aquilant, and Healthcare 21 will still have, when you talk to a catheterization laboratory or theater, you can't offer them the breadth of product to be their main supplier. You can offer them some of the niche and interesting products, but you can't say you will also pick up the rest. One of the differentiators when it comes to supplying is that you can't do these broad-based offerings.

### If HC 21 can't, nobody can because they're one of the biggest in this space?

It doesn't happen within the distribution model.

### Do some OEMs have that?

Some of the OEMs do that. They'll basically take 80% of the business from a cath lab and everybody else fights for the remaining 20%.

### Are competitors the OEMs going direct or companies like Vascular Perspectives and Uniphar?
