# Activation Energy
Creating lasting change is harder than creating change. Don't underestimate the activation energy required to not only break apart existing bonds, but to create new, strong ones. 

Some reactions are not quick, and all take some degree of effort. Trying to accurately estimate the activation energy required means you're less likely to quit too early. You won't run out of gas on the way up the hill or stop supporting a team during its transition phase. If you have enough activation energy, reactions will keep going, finishing what was started and forming new bonds that will then take a significant reinvestment of activation energy to break. 

Real changes takes effort. Invest more than you think you need to, and you just might get there.
