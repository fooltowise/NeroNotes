### Signalling in biology

[[Competition for sex|Sexual selection]],[[Competition in politics|politics]] and [[Social status]] require two complementary skill sets: **the ability to *evaluate potential partners* and the ability to *attract good partners*.** Hence the need for [[signalling]].

A signal in evolutionary biology is anything used to communicate or convey information.

Signals are said to be *honest* when they reliably correspond to the underlying trait or fact about the sender.
The temptation to deceive is ubiquitous. Deception allows an agent to reap benefits without incurring costs.

In the human social realm, honest signalling and the handicap principle are best reflected in the dictum "Actions speak louder than words." The problem with words is that they cost almost nothing. talk is usually too cheap. Which is more honest of your value to a company: being told "great job!" or getting a raise?
