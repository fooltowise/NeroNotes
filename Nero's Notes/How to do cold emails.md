I’ve raised millions of dollars via cold emails. Here’s my exact playbook that you can use:


Great cold emails can help: 1. Raise money 2. Attract top talent 3. Build new partnerships The opportunities are endless. But you need a good strategy.



Let’s say you’re the founder of an AI-powered stethoscope called “Stethy” You’re looking to raise some money. Here’s how to raise money with cold emails:



1 - Define Your Goal Our goal is to ask investors to join us for a call and get their feedback on our product or direction. Once we’ve had a conversation with them, we can gauge their interest in investing.

2 - Find Investors Go to 'Angel .co' Filter by category “Health” Write down a list of investors Use 'Hunter .io' to find investor emails

3 - Do your research After you have your list of investors, you have to do your research. - What are their values? - What’s their background? - What stage do they typically invest in? - What companies have they funded in the past?
Spend time understanding each investor’s goals and preferences. We’ll use this when crafting our email, but remember this…
Sending 10 unique cold emails > 100 copy and pasted cold emails. Don’t skimp out on your research. Investors get 100s of emails. Do your research and your emails will stick out.

4 - Draft Your Email The best cold emails follow the AIDA format. - Attention - Interest - Desire - Action Let’s dive into an example…


Create Attention When it comes to cold emails, you create attention in the subject line. Here’re some recommendations: 1. Keep it short 2. Pose a question 3. Share a compelling insight

Pique Their Interest After you’ve captured their attention, it’s your job to pique their interest. In one to two sentences… - What’s your story? - Where are you going? - What have you accomplished?
