Growth through gaining market share has two things in its favor.
- First, it is independent of the economic climate - share gains can occur in bad or good times.
- Second, it is something over which the company itself has a degree of control.

Some companies are able to deliver consistent gains in market share through strategies such as compelling advertising campaigns, successful store roll-out or ongoing investment in distribution. Companies with a proven track record of steady market share accretion can be highly attractive investments.

When analyzing market share gains, understanding the source is important. Market shares in some industries fluctuate dramatically depending on relative pricing strategies and product innovation of participants. Market share gains represent the best pathway to growth if they can happen in a consistent way and, ideally, in a market where the investor can identify a reliable share donator.

But it does get more difficult  as market share grows: obviously, the easiest to recruit customers move first. It also becomes less significant as a company's share grows. Gaining 1 percent of a market doubles the reach of an existing holder of 1 percent, while such a gain would be modest for the holder of a 10 percent share, and negligible for the 50 percent market leader.
