Hierarchy is a core instinct. 

While we can modify hierarchies and try to make them work for us, it is hard to do away with them all together. We operate as if a leaderless environment provides more threats than one with a bad leader. 

However, the model demands balance. Too much hierarchy can also leasd to unrest and unstability. Most organisations promote  cultures that emphasize rather than de-emphasize an individual's status, power, and place, which is part of the reason they get torn apart, as the fight to get to the top of the hierarchy takes precedence over the success of the organization. 

We all look for leaders, even if we are looking at ourselves.
