Another form of [[Pricing power]] exists when companies are able to price for value. In some cases, price for value increases are dubious exchanges but consumers nevertheless pay. The most conspicuous examples occur in the computer software industry, when vendors add small features accompanied by substantial price increases.

In other industries, price-for-value propositions are both more substantively meaningful to customers and less obvious to outsiders. Take seeds for farmers. Companies like Monsanto develop seed products that improve farm yields by 1-2% annually. Monsanto pursues a strategy of sharing the value upside with the farmer, raising prices each year to a level that means approximately one third of this benefit accrues to them, with the farmer getting the rest. A company that can continuously develop products while pricing for value can build durable pricing power.
