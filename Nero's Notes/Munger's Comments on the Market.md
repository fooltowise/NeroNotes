### Stocks, Rembrandts, and Bubbles
Stocks are valued partly like bonds, based on a roughly rational projections of producing future cash. But they are also valued partly like Rembrandt paintings, purchased mostly because their price have gone up so far. This situation, combined with big "wealth effects", at first up and later down, can conceivably produce much mischief. 

[April 2020] It's the most extreme in modern capitalism. In the 1930s, we had the worst depression in 600 years. Today is almost as extreme in the opposite way... We use the phrase "wretched excess" because the consequences are wretched. 

Bonds are much more rational. No one thinks a bond's value will soar to the moon.

### Future market returns
[November 2000] If stocks compound at fifteen percent going forward, then it will be due to a big "Rembrandt effect". This is not good. Look at what happened in Japan, where stocks traded at fifty to sixty times earnings. This led to a ten-year depression. I think that was a special situation, though. My guess is that we won't get extreme "Rembrandtisation", and the returns thereafter will be six percent. If I'm wrong, it could be for a bad reason. If stocks trade more like Rembrandts in the future, then stocks will rise, but they will have no anchors. In this case, it's hard to predict how far, how high, and how long it will last.

[April 2001] I think generally that American investors should reduce their expectations. People aren't being a little stupid, but massively stupid. No one has an interest in saying this though.

[May 2001] We are not in a hog-heaven period. The investment game is getting more and more competitive. I don't know if we'll ever see stocks in general at the mouth-watering levels that we saw in 1973-1974 or even in 1982. I think there's a very excellent chance that neither Warren nor I will see those opportunities again, but that's not all bad. We'll just keep plugging away.

Buffett: It's not out of the realm of possibility though. You can never predict what markets will do. In Japan, a ten-year bond is yielding five-eights of one percent. Who could have ever imagined that? 
If that could happen in Japan, something much less bad could happen in the US. We could be in for a period in which the average fancy-paid investment advisor just won0t do very well.

The temporary collapse in junk bonds in late 2002, where they got to thirty-five to forty percent yields, was just a strange thing. There was absolute chaos at the bottom tick. Apply this behavior to stocks - it's not hard to imagine a big crunch coming along.

### Current outlook
[May 2004] In terms of the general climate, I think it's pretty miserable fir anyone who likes easy, sure money. Common stocks may be reasonably fairly valued, but they are not overwhelmingly bargains.

Our cash is speaking for itself. If we had a lot of wonderful ideas, we wouldn't have so much cash.

Berkshire and Wesco are full of cash that we don't know what to do with. Berkshire has $70 billion if you count the bonds, and Wesco is drowning in cash. It's the most extreme it's ever been. In the past, we've just been patient, and we were able to put it to work.
