# Sustainable Sources of Personal Competitive Advantage


### by Morgan Housel
The only truly [sustainable sources of competitive advantage I know of are](http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/sustainable-sources-of-competitive-advantage/):

-   Learn faster than your competition.
    
-   Empathize with customers more than your competition.
    
-   Communicate more effectively than your competition.
    
-   Be willing to fail more than your competition.
    
-   Wait longer than your competition.
    

Everything else – intelligence, design, insight – gets smashed to pieces by competitors who are almost certainly as smart as you.

**Notes from Julien: To which I would add:**
- Be more reliable than your competition
- Be more trustworthy than your competition
