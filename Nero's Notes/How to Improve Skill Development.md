# How to improve Skill development


You can increase the velocity of development with three variables: 
- (1) The quantity of focused repetitions; 
- (2) The situations under which they occur; and 
- (3) The quality of feedback.

While these variables need to be tailored to your environment, they carry the weight. The mistake we often make in the workplace is the same one that we often make at practice. We offer limited reps under tightly controlled situations with ego driven feedback.

Adapting these to your environment means:

-   **Focus on the meta skill not the specific skill**
-   **Focus on increasing the number of focused repetitions and the variety of situations under which they occur**
-   **Setting up the environment to help generate both rapid and high-quality internal feedback. What information do people need to know they should have done something different. How fast can you make that information available?**
-   **External feedback (from a boss/coach) needs to be based on a relationship, focused on the person not what you think, and based on thinking not actions (_e.g.,_ what did they miss – why is there a need for external feedback).**

Focused repetitions give you feedback. Feedback makes you better. Each repetition builds upon the ones you’ve already done. This is how greatness happens. A series of tiny gains, imperceptible in moment, aggregate into massive differences in the end.

You almost can’t help but get better if you apply these four things to your situation.
