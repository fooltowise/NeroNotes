# INTJ MBTI Type
## Introduction

WHO IS AN ARCHITECT (INTJ)?

An Architect (INTJ) is a person with the [Introverted](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/mind-introverted-vs-extraverted), [Intuitive](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/energy-intuitive-vs-observant), [Thinking](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/nature-thinking-vs-feeling), and [Judging](https://www.16personalities.com/articles/tactics-judging-vs-prospecting) personality traits. These thoughtful tacticians love perfecting the details of life, applying creativity and rationality to everything they do. Their inner world is often a private, complex one.

> BLAISE PASCAL

It can be lonely at the top. As one of the rarest personality types – and one of the most capable – Architects (INTJs) know this all too well. Rational and quick-witted, Architects may struggle to find people who can keep up with their nonstop analysis of everything around them.

### A Thirst for Knowledge

These personalities can be both the boldest of dreamers and the bitterest of pessimists. Architects believe that, through willpower and intelligence, they can achieve even the most challenging of goals. But they may be cynical about human nature more generally, assuming that most people are lazy, unimaginative, or simply doomed to mediocrity.

Architects derive much of their self-esteem from their knowledge and mental acuity. In school, people with this personality type may have been called “bookworms” or “nerds.” But rather than taking these labels as insults, many Architects embrace them. They are confident in their ability to teach themselves about – and master – any topic that interests them, whether that’s coding or capoeira or classical music.

> “You are not entitled to your opinion. You are entitled to your informed opinion. No one is entitled to be ignorant.”
> 
> HARLAN ELLISON

Architects can be single-minded, with little patience for frivolity, distractions, or idle gossip. That said, it would be a mistake to stereotype these personalities as dull or humorless. Many Architects are known for their irreverent wit, and beneath their serious exteriors, they often have a sharp, delightfully sarcastic sense of humor.

### Finding a Better Way

Architects question everything. Many personality types trust the status quo, relying on conventional wisdom and other people’s expertise as they go about their lives. But ever-skeptical Architects prefer to make their own discoveries. In their quest to find better ways of doing things, they aren’t afraid to break the rules or risk disapproval – in fact, they rather enjoy it.

But as anyone with this personality type would tell you, a new idea isn’t worth anything unless it actually works. Architects want to be successful, not just inventive. They bring a single-minded drive to their passion projects, applying the full force of their insight, logic, and willpower. And heaven help anyone who tries to slow them down by enforcing pointless rules or offering poorly thought-out criticism.

Architects, independent to the core, want to shake off other people’s expectations and pursue their own ideas.

This personality type comes with a strong independent streak. Architects don’t mind acting alone, perhaps because they don’t like waiting around for others to catch up with them. They also generally feel comfortable making decisions without asking for anyone else’s input. At times, this lone-wolf behavior can come across as insensitive, as it fails to take into consideration other people’s thoughts, desires, and plans.

### Social Frustrations

Architects aren’t known for being warm and fuzzy. They tend to prioritize rationality and success over politeness and pleasantries – in other words, they’d rather be right than popular. This may explain why so many fictional villains are modeled on this personality type.

Because Architects value truth and depth, many common social practices – from small talk to white lies – may seem pointless or downright stupid to them. As a result, they may inadvertently come across as rude or even offensive when they’re only trying to be honest. At times, Architects may wonder if dealing with other people is even worth the frustration.

But like any personality type, Architects do crave social interaction – they’d just prefer to surround themselves with people who share their values and priorities. Often, they can achieve this just by being themselves. When Architects pursue their interests, their natural confidence can draw people to them – professionally, socially, and even romantically.

### The Chess Game of Life

This personality type is full of contradictions. Architects are imaginative yet decisive, ambitious yet private, and curious yet focused. From the outside, these contradictions may seem baffling, but they make perfect sense once you understand the inner workings of the Architect mind.

For Architects, life is like a giant game of chess. Relying on strategy rather than chance, they contemplate the strengths and weaknesses of each move before they make it. And they never lose faith that, with enough ingenuity and insight, they can find a way to win – no matter what challenges might arise along the way.

## Strengths & Weaknesses

### Architect (INTJ) Strengths

![Architect (INTJ) strengths](https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/analysts_Architect_INTJ_strengths.svg)

-   **Rational** – Architects pride themselves on their minds. For them, nearly any situation can become an opportunity to expand their knowledge and hone their rational thinking skills. Thanks to this mindset, they can devise inventive solutions to even the most arduous of problems.
-   **Informed** – Few personality types are as devoted as Architects to forming rational, evidence-based opinions. Rather than hunches or half-baked assumptions, they base their conclusions on research and analysis. This gives them the self-assurance they need to stand up for their ideas, even in the face of disagreement.
-   **Independent** – For these personality types, conformity is more or less synonymous with mediocrity. Creative and self-motivated, Architects strive to do things their own way. They can imagine few things more frustrating than allowing rules or conventions to stand in the way of their success.
-   **Determined** – Architect personalities are ambitious and goal-oriented. Whenever an idea or pursuit captures their imagination, Architects dedicate themselves to mastering the subject and gaining relevant skills. They tend to have clear visions of what it means for them to be successful, and few things can deter them from turning these visions into reality.
-   **Curious** – Architects are open to new ideas – as long as those ideas are rational and evidence-based, that is. Skeptical by nature, these personality types are especially drawn to offbeat or contrarian points of view. They’re even open to changing their own opinions when the facts prove them wrong.
-   **Versatile** – Architects love diving into all sorts of challenges. Their curiosity and determination can help people with this personality type succeed in a wide range of endeavors.

### Architect (INTJ) Weaknesses

![Architect (INTJ) weaknesses](https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/analysts_Architect_INTJ_weaknesses.svg)

-   **Arrogant** – Architects might be knowledgeable, but they’re not infallible. Their self-assurance can blind them to useful input from other people – especially anyone they deem to be intellectually inferior. These personalities can also become needlessly harsh or single-minded in trying to prove others wrong.
-   **Dismissive of Emotions** – For Architects, rationality is king. But emotional context often matters more than people with this personality type care to admit. Architects can get impatient with anyone who seems to value feelings more than facts. Unfortunately, ignoring emotion is its own type of bias – one that can cloud Architects’ judgment.
-   **Overly Critical** – These personalities tend to have a great deal of self-control, particularly when it comes to thoughts and feelings. When the people in their lives fail to match their level of restraint, Architects can become scathingly critical. But this criticism is often unfair, based on arbitrary standards rather than a full understanding of human nature.
-   **Combative** – Architects hate blindly following _anything_ without understanding why. This includes restrictions and the authority figures who impose them. People with this personality type can get caught up in arguing about useless rules and regulations – but sometimes these battles are distractions from more important matters.
-   **Romantically Clueless** – Architects’ relentless rationality can lead them to be frustrated by romance. Especially in the early stages of a relationship, they may struggle to understand what’s going on and how to behave. And if their relationships fall apart for reasons they don’t understand, they can become cynical about matters of the heart, even questioning the importance of love and connection.

## Romantic Relationships

> “Of all forms of caution, caution in love is perhaps the most fatal to true happiness.”
> 
> BERTRAND RUSSELL

People with the Architect (INTJ) personality type approach romance the way they do most challenges: strategically, with clear-cut goals and a plan for reaching them. In a purely rational world, this approach would be foolproof. Alas, it ignores important factors that Architects sometimes dismiss – such as the unpredictability of human nature and affection.

For these personalities, finding a compatible partner can be a particular challenge. Rarely satisfied with things as they are, Architects are always developing a world in their minds that is more perfect than reality. Other people entering their world need to fit this fantasy in some way. But if Architects’ expectations and ideals for a partner are unrealistic, then no real person will be able to fulfill them in every way.

### The Rites of Dating

Architects care about depth and intelligence, and they insist on honest, open communication. For them, a relationship that isn’t founded on these values is hardly worth pursuing.

It might not come as a surprise, then, that the social niceties and obscure etiquette of dating can seem useless or even insulting to Architect personality types. But many of these conventions exist for a reason – to help an inherently unpredictable situation seem a little less daunting. If Architects refuse to play along, they may find the dating world difficult, if not impossible.

As Architects often learn, the ways of love are hard to describe in a spreadsheet.

As they mature and gain experience, many Architects eventually come to understand the purpose of romantic rituals. Until that point, however, they may decide that dating is too irrational or beneath them. Some people with this personality type might constantly try to demonstrate their intellectual superiority, as a way of proving that they’re above the “silliness” of dating. Obviously, this mindset is unlikely to help Architects find or connect with a partner.

Sometimes, Architects’ best strategy is to focus on what they enjoy rather than struggle against the rules of dating. Ironically, people with this personality type are often most attractive when they aren’t trying to be. Just doing what they do best – pursuing the interests that light them up – can help their confidence and intelligence shine.

### Emotion Sickness

Architect personalities aren’t known for conventional shows of romance, such as sending flowers or writing mushy notes. Most Architects spend more time thinking about love than expressing it. But when they believe that a relationship has potential, Architects can give it their all, working to maintain stability and ensure their partner’s long-term satisfaction. And by using their imagination, people with this personality type can find meaningful, if unexpected, ways to share their affection.

Architects seek strong, meaningful relationships. They use their knowledge and logic to help ensure that their partner is satisfied.

That said, emotions may still feel like a second language to these personalities. Rather than getting to the core of their relationship conflicts, Architects might treat them as puzzles to be solved – an approach that isn’t always successful. And when their partner shares strong feelings, Architects might shut down, or they may be tempted to analyze the situation rather than simply listening and offering support. For Architects, becoming comfortable with their partner’s emotions – and their own – can take more than a little practice.

Love is rarely easy, but it’s a challenge that can help Architects grow. Through their relationships, Architects can learn to focus on the present, get in touch with their emotions, remain involved with other people, and stay open to things they’re not used to. For a personality type so intent on self-development, these opportunities can make love even more satisfying.

## Friendships

> “A friend to all is a friend to none.”
> 
> ARISTOTLE

Sharp-witted and darkly funny, Architects (INTJs) aren’t everyone’s cup of tea – and they’re okay with that. For the most part, people with this personality type aren’t obsessed with being popular. They don’t spend their time and energy on just anyone, and they can be difficult to get to know.

But this doesn’t mean that Architects are antisocial or friendless. In fact, few things are more exhilarating to Architect personalities than the spark they feel when they connect with someone who really gets them.

![Architect (INTJ) friends](https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/analysts_Architect_INTJ_friendships.svg)

### The Search for an Equal

Architects tend to have strong opinions about what works, what doesn’t, what they’re looking for, and what they’re not. This mindset gives them a clear picture of what they expect from their social lives and their friends – and it can also lead them to reject anyone who doesn’t seem to meet these expectations. From the outside, people with this personality type may seem dismissive, but they would say they’re just being decisive.

In friendship, Architects are looking for an intellectual equal as much as anything else. These personalities crave mental stimulation, and they can become bored by anyone who can’t keep up with the workings of their minds. Architects need to share their expansive ideas – making small talk is something they typically avoid.

Architects care about depth and quality. They’d rather have just a few good friends than a large circle of acquaintances.

In their friendships, as in other aspects of their lives, Architects prize independence. Social obligations can feel stifling to people with this personality type. Architects don’t want to feel beholden to their friends, and they don’t want their friends to feel beholden to them. For them, an ideal friendship is low drama, based on mutual respect rather than obligation.

Of course, any friendship will have its dramatic moments. When sensitive or emotional situations arise, Architects may feel out of their depth. Even with their closest friends, these personalities may struggle to offer comfort – or receive it. Architects are used to feeling knowledgeable and capable, and this sudden cluelessness can be disorienting for them.

### A Unique Friendship

It’s not always easy to befriend an Architect. People with this personality type have little patience for social rules. Instead, they look for friends who value intellect, honesty, and self-improvement. They may become bored or irritated by anyone who falls short of this mark. Fortunately, anyone who does share these qualities is likely to appreciate Architects as well.

Among friends whom they know and respect, Architects have no trouble relaxing and being themselves. Their sarcasm and witty banter may not be for everyone – especially people who struggle to read between the lines. But Architects reward their true friends with candor and insight, along with an endless supply of fascinating stories, ideas, and conversations.

## Parenthood

> “Children must be taught how to think, not what to think.”
> 
> MARGARET MEAD

Architects (INTJs) are known for their rationality and self-control, and they may be bemused by anyone who doesn’t share these strengths – for example, children. Parenting may not come easily to these personalities, requiring them to master new skills and increase their cognitive flexibility. Fortunately, Architects are pretty much always up for a challenge. And for Architects who choose to have children, few challenges may be as meaningful as parenthood.

### An Honest Connection

Architects want their children to grow up to be capable and self-reliant, with clear interests and strong critical-thinking skills. Rather than enforce pointless rules, they look for age-appropriate ways to foster their child’s independence. That’s not to say that parents with this personality type are lenient – far from it. They expect their children to use their freedom responsibly.

![Architect (INTJ) parents](https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/analysts_Architect_INTJ_parenthood.svg)

Some personality types might shelter their children from difficult subjects, but Architect parents typically believe that knowledge is far better than ignorance. For them, candor is a way of showing respect, and shielding their children from reality would be a disservice. Of course, the success of this approach depends on Architects’ ability to correctly gauge their children’s readiness for these hard truths.

### The Chaos of Emotions

Compared to other personality types, Architects aren’t especially comfortable with displays of affection. Showering someone with love, praise, and affection can feel unnatural to them – even if that “someone” is their own child. But children need cuddling and other expressions of love, particularly during their younger years. As a result, Architect parents may need to expand their emotional comfort zone in order to show their children how much they are loved.

Another challenge for parents with this personality type is offering emotional support. Architects take pride in being in command of their feelings, and they might expect their children to be able to do the same. But this expectation isn’t reasonable – emotions may be confusing and, at times, chaotic, but they’re perfectly normal, and children need validation and support in order to navigate them.

Architects are at their best when they can develop a plan to solve a problem’s root cause. But sometimes the best solution to a kid’s problem is just sitting with them as they explore their feelings.

### Preparing for Life’s Challenges

Architects try to make sure that their children are prepared to deal with anything that life throws at them. Parents with this personality type can reframe problems as opportunities for personal growth, inspiring their children to develop their own style of rational thinking and problem-solving. Over time, Architects’ children can apply these skills to increasingly complex situations, building their confidence as they grow.

Every parent has a different dream for their child’s future. For Architects, the dream is to raise a competent adult who knows their own mind and solves their own problems – and, if the time comes, helps their own children do the same. Architects understand that this can’t happen if they protect their children from every difficult or unpleasant thing in life. But their hope is that, if they give their children the right tools, they won’t have to.

## Career Paths

> “One never notices what has been done; one can only see what remains to be done, and if one didn’t like the work, it would be very discouraging.”
> 
> MARIE CURIE

Professional know-how is often where Architects (INTJs) shine most brilliantly. But these personalities won’t settle for just any career. They want to tackle meaningful challenges and find elegant solutions to important problems, not just tinker with figures in a spreadsheet.

Architects also want the freedom to exercise their greatest strengths. Few personality types, if any, can match their ability to transform complex principles into clear and actionable strategies. Architects know how much they have to offer in their professional lives – and for them, any job that fails to draw on their skills and knowledge is a wasted opportunity.

![Architect (INTJ) careers](https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/analysts_Architect_INTJ_career_path.svg)

### The Early-Career Blues

Starting out at the bottom of the career ladder can be frustrating for Architects. Early in their professional lives, they may be saddled with easy, routine tasks that bore them half to death. People with this personality type brim with creative, out-of-the-box ideas. But with their disdain for schmoozing and workplace politics, they may struggle to earn the favor of their bosses and colleagues.

The good news is that, over time, Architects can develop their abilities into a track record so effective that it can’t be ignored. Even when the people around them fall prey to groupthink, Architect personalities can cut through the noise and figure out the true cause of a problem – and then fix it. Their competence gives them an advantage. As long as they don’t alienate their coworkers, Architects can advance in their careers and gain the independence they need to see their ideas through.

### Finding Their Place

Some personality types are drawn to jobs that require nonstop teamwork and interaction, but Architects tend to prefer lone-wolf positions. By working alone or in small groups, they can make the most of their creativity without constant interruptions from curious coworkers or second-guessing supervisors. Architects really do believe that if you want something done right, you’d better do it yourself.

The other side of that coin is that Architects have little respect for anyone who gets ahead based on networking or nepotism rather than merit. People with this personality type value resourcefulness, grit, insight, and commitment – in themselves and in others. They believe that everyone should get their work done to the highest possible standards. So if a social butterfly at work breezes through without carrying their own weight, Architects may feel called to use their ingenuity to bring that person back down to earth.

### Ever Greater Challenges

Architect personality types demand progress and evolution, and they love to explore new ideas. As their careers progress, they may be drawn to positions that allow them to influence a company or organization’s overall strategies. Many Architects pursue low-profile but influential roles as project managers, systems engineers, marketing strategists, systems analysts, and military strategists.

**Architects view a combination of intelligent approaches and hard work as the road to excellence.**

The truth is that Architects can excel in just about any role. Some careers with strong social components, such as sales or human resources, might not seem like obvious fits – but fortunately, Architects know how to look beyond the obvious. These personalities have the creativity and vision to make important contributions in any workplace, and these skills certainly give them a leg up if they choose to start their own business.

---

## Workplace Habits

What Architects (INTJs) want – wherever they may be in their careers – is to pursue their professional goals according to their own standards. And if any personality type has high standards for themselves, it’s almost certainly Architects.

In theory, this attitude makes for a model employee and coworker. And in many ways, Architects are exactly that. But some personality types may find it a challenge to work with Architects. Architects may be harsh or dismissive toward people they don’t respect – and unfortunately, losing their respect can be all too easy. In particular, they have little time for coworkers who prioritize convenience over innovation or socializing over success.

### Architect Subordinates

Architects are known for their independence. Even in entry-level jobs, they may chafe at anyone who tries to limit their freedom. Their worst nightmare would be a micromanaging boss who monopolizes their time with pointless meetings, insists on useless rules, and appraises employees’ performance based on how likable they seem rather than their actual merits.

![Architect (INTJ) workplace habits](https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/scenes/analysts_Architect_INTJ_workplace_habits.svg)

Titles mean little to Architects, and they often struggle to defer to a manager they don’t respect. They might also find it difficult to restrain themselves from offering their bosses feedback and criticism – an approach that, depending on the boss, can backfire.

In the real world, not all bosses will be as logical or open-minded as Architects might prefer. But that doesn’t mean that people with this personality type should allow a less-than-ideal manager to hold them back.

Architects may need to use all of their creativity and ingenuity to expand their responsibilities and develop their expertise – even if they don’t have the independence they crave. To do this, they may need to prioritize building a productive and respectful relationship with their manager, no matter how far from perfect that person may be.

### Architect Colleagues

Few Architects choose jobs that require constant teamwork or social interaction. To these personalities, most team-building techniques and group meetings are a waste of time. And chitchat, gossip, and office politics – well, those can be nothing short of workplace plagues.

Many Architects would rather work alone than be slowed down by anyone who isn’t as focused as they are. Fortunately, their perfectionism and resolve often enable them to produce effective results even without the help of others.

That’s not to say that Architects can’t work with others – in fact, they may achieve some of their greatest successes this way. Their capability and reliability can make them excellent collaborators. People with this personality type may never enjoy pairing up with coworkers who get hung up on the wrong details or can’t otherwise earn their respect. But in the company of a small group of trusted colleagues, Architects’ brainstorming sessions may become even more electric.

### Architect Managers

Though they may be surprised to hear it, Architects can make great leaders. In the workplace, they rarely throw around their authority just to prove that they’re in charge. Instead, they look for ways to promote innovation and effectiveness – even if that means breaking with established hierarchies. Some managers might enjoy being pandered to, but Architect personalities would rather be successful than constantly validated.

Generally speaking, Architects prefer to treat those who work for them as equals. Rather than micromanaging, they aim to direct broader strategies while letting other people handle day-to-day activities. That’s not to say that they’re completely hands-off, however. Architect bosses want to know exactly what’s going on and when, and they're always ready to drill into any level of detail necessary.

These managers respect and reward proactive behavior, delegating responsibilities to employees with the strongest critical-thinking skills. But this freedom isn’t just granted – it’s required. Employees who struggle to direct themselves – who just want to be told what to do – may have a hard time meeting Architects’ standards. And anyone who tries to cover up bad results with flattery or excuses is likely to be disappointed. Those strategies rarely work with Architect personalities.

> LYNNE TILLMAN

Armed with powerful intellects and strategic minds, Architects (INTJs) can outmaneuver obstacles that seem unbeatable to most. But their strengths, when misunderstood, can turn into weaknesses – and keep them from reaching their full potential.
