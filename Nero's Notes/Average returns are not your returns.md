**Averages are misleading. Systems might work on average and still fail locally. **

If you miss a plane because the train to the airport is late, the train company telling you that trains are one minute late on average will not bring any relief. You do not even care whether the average delay is one minute or ten. You only care about the fact that the one time the train is late half an hour, you will miss your plane.

If next time, the train arrives thirty minutes in advance, it will not make up for the missed plane. You do not get a free flight when the train arrives in advance.


**As an individual, you do not care whether the system works on average. You care if it works for you.**

As a rule of thumb, **we cannot rely on averages whenever there is a possibility for irreversible damage.**

If you find yourself in an non-ergodic situation, do not focus on population-wide averages. **Care about *your* outcome, not the average one.**
