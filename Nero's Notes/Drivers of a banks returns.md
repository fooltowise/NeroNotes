When analyzing the return on equity of lending institutions and banks in particular, we should keep in mind several points. Let's consider for instance a bank boasting about a 20% return on equity.
- These institutions are usually very leveraged. If the leverage factor is 15, this means that the return on assets is around 1.4%.
- The critical factor is to figure out if the cost of loans has been correctly taken into account. Credit risk is real, and one should check if the bank has made proper reservers for bad debts. A combined high loan growth with a low cost of loans. 
- A rise in the cost of loans (i.e non performing loans) can wreak havoc in the ROE of the bank. In our example, a rise from 0.5% to 1% of provisions for bad debt will lead to a decline in ROE from 20% to 16%.
