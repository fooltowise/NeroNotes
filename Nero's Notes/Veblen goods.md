A Veblen good is a good for which demand increases as the price increases, because of its exclusive nature and appeal as a status symbol [[Signaling]]. A Veblen good has an upward-sloping demand curve, which runs counter to the typical downward-sloping curve.

Veblen goods are named after American economist Thorstein Veblen, who first identified conspicuous consumption as a mode of status-seeking in *The Theory of the Leisure Class* (1899). A corollary of the Veblen effect is that lowering the price decreases the quantity demanded.
