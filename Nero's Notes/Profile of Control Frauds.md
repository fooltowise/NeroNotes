Control frauds often share the same profile of characteristics:
- Grow like crazy (you need growth to keep feeding the ponzi scheme)
- by making bad loans at a premium yield while
- employing extreme leverage (almost none of the money risked is yours)
- and providing only grossly inadequate allowances for loan and leases losses

A [[Lending Business| lender]] who follows this recipe is guaranteed to report record (albeit fictional) short-term profits. **The senior officers that control the fraudulent lender are guaranteed to be made wealthy** promptly through modern executive compensation. The recipe is guaranteed to maximise losses to the lender.
