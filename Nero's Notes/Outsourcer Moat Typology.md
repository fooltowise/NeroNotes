# Outsourcer Moat Typology

## Attributes
- There should be runway of outsourcing: we don't want the market share to be already high, or to compete in an industry where most of the market has been outsourced.
- The outsourced service should be a relatively small part of the customer's PnL, but the cost of failure should be very high. If it's a really high piece of the expense line, the company won't get enough pricing power.
- The customer base should be fragmented.  We don't want an outsourcer relying on two big customers.
- **We want evidence that the outsourcer is continuously moving up the value chain.** If we go back and study what the great outsourcers have done over time, they started doing pretty basic things. And then over time they became a lot more essential. Their role in the ecosystem just became a lot bigger, and a lot of that is just by effectively being like an outsourced R&D arm for those companies.
