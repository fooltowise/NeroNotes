# Social Capital

- Trust is a proxy for social capital
- What bloggers do is transform knowledge into social capital, then transform social capital into financial capital.
- Are  Social capital and financial capital interchangeable?
- Poor people tend to not relocate because leaving their social network will cut them out from their social capital (family, friends, church, etc.)
- The reason the Amish can do their barn raisings is due to strong social codes/ pressure, etc. in other settings people just try to get on the winning/taking side of reciprocity and make the other side a sucker. (see [[Norms]])
- 2020 was an experiment in extremely low consumption. Our combined spending was something like $16.5k for the whole year. We used "social capital" which interestingly enough was brought up by J+G in the ERE Wheaton scale chart thread. Bringing costs down creatively by leveraging community and mutually beneficial arrangements like house/pet sitting, work for stay, etc all become much more feasible when you don't have a schedule to follow and can stay in one area longer, or at least build up that capital first, then return to an area where such arrangements are possible. I guess what I'm getting at is that we know that if work didn't require a certain style of travel/accommodation/connectivity then our costs instantly drop by an order of magnitude.

- I also find social capital tricky. I usually go to great lengths to avoid tapping it whenever possible. So I'd rather buy a new tool than borrow it from a friend, or pay for a taxi instead of asking a friend to pick me from the airport at night. I think this is due to my personality and worldview - I value independence very highly and just don't like being indebted in any way, be it financial, social or any other. That's why I don't buy into the idea that everyone can replace financial capital with social capital \- I know it's possible and it's a default modus operandi in most of the world, but I just don't see myself tapping it even in a world where I have a ton of it (**I also see social capital as very fragile - sometimes one gossip is enough to lose all of it permanently**)
- People with social capital have an easier time finding someone to do favors (saves money of hiring someone), can often get free stuff, if they are looking for work there will be a bunch of people mentioning potential opportunities for them, and if they start some sort of project then they have an already established method for getting word of mouth out about it. Plus of course there are the more conventional benefits of good social connections



The basic idea of social capital consists of the belief that individuals’ lives can be made easier and be qualitatively improved by personal networks, or rather by the social resources that these relationships manage to mobilize.

The list of social resources includes: 
1. Material resources (alter has provided or can provide ego with money, goods, etc.); 
2. Reputation and social credentials (the fact that ego knows alter has increased or can increase the standing and respect that ego receives from others and therefore the chances of reaching his/her goals); 
3. Contacts and inter-person acquaintances (alter has introduced or can introduce ego to people who can help him); 
4. Symbolic and expressive resources (sharing of the most appropriate strategies for achieving goals, i.e. advice, moral or psychological support, reassurance, the chance to let off steam, etc.).



The network most “specialized” in providing material resources is the family network, followed by friends and – a distant third – colleagues. On the other hand, for all other types of resource, it is fellow members of the interviewee’s third sector organization who display the greatest willingness to provide help. Therefore, if we leave out the family sphere, which is the provider of material support par excellence, in all other cases it is participation in the life of an third sector organization and investment in that relational context that is the principal source of social capital. The third sector organization network is able to mobilize a proportionally greater percentage of help. Perhaps we could argue that involving oneself in a third sector organization is a sound investment in terms of social capital. With an average value of 77%, third sector organizations are the ones that offer the greatest opportunity to get to know charismatic people and people with the “keys” to certain social spheres compared with all the other relational spheres. As far as reputation is concerned, not only third sector members (57%) but also family groups (55%) and circles of friends (55%) make a significant contribution to the construction and maintenance of the interviewees’ social standing.

Social capital is classically defined as resources stemming from the possession of a durable network of acquaintance or recognition (Bourdieu 1985)
 
 
In dense personal networks, most if not all individuals are interconnected. Such interconnection enhances expectations, claims, obligations, and trust because of the collective nature of normative control. If the focal individual (or Ego) violates the group’s expectations, the other individuals may jointly react. Dense networks also facilitate communication by multiplying the number of information channels and reducing the number of intermediaries between any two network members (Widmer 2006). Finally, in dense networks, support is collective, as individuals are likely to coordinate their efforts in helping one another. From this perspective, social capital is found in personal networks in which most if not all alters of a focal individual, or Ego, are interconnected by significant relationships, which means a high density of connections exists. This structure of social capital is thus defined as bonding social capital.

A second understanding of social capital underlines the bridging potential of relationships in personal networks, full of brokerage opportunities (Burt 1995, 2002; Widmer 2016). The absence of relationships among some alters creates ‘holes’ in the structure, which provide focal individuals with opportunities to mediate the flow of information between their alters and hence control their interactions (Burt 2002).

Strong networks, in that second understanding, are not dense but rather centralised around Ego, who is able to master his or her connections because alters have no direct connection with each other. Individuals with bridging social capital have distinct subsets of network members, for which they may become bridgers or brokers; they do not benefit, however, from a cohesive group of network members who know or often interact with each other. 

On the one hand, individuals with only bonding social capital available in their personal networks have interconnected supportive alters who may help them to progress in their local environment. On the other hand, this redundancy of ties impedes their contact with a diversity of world views or information and to some extent jeopardises their autonomy.
