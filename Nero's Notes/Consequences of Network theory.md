The [[Network Theory and Scale]] has direct implications on scaling systems and beings. 

### Fractal behavior:

As the first axiom orders the network to fill most of the place available, networks will often have a fractal behavior. A fractal line tends to occupy a full area. A fractal area tends to occupy a full volume. As a generalization, a fractal object of dimension n will tend to fill an object of dimensions n+1. As volumes have 3 dimensions, fractal volumes will tend to have geometrical properties in 4 dimensions. This is why the scaling power laws often have exponent that are multiples of 1/4.

### Impedence matching

The third axiom will often dictate how objects divide to another scale. For instance, when the aorta divides into two arteries, the division needs to satisfy the minimization of cardiac power output. In particular, as the heart pattern is cyclical (and thus creates waves), there should not be any blood coming back from the division to the heart. This condition is called *impedance matching* in wave theory. As a result the area of the cross section of the bigger object (the aorta) has to be the same as the area of the cross sections of the two smaller objects (arteries). In particular, the diameter of the artery is equal to the diameter of the aorta divided by the square root of two. The same pattern happens when arteries divide in smaller arteries.

### Application to Mammals:

- There is a limit to how small a mammal can be, which is coming from the fact that the heart has to "pulse" the blood into capillaries (the invariant units), but these capillaries have to work in a continuous mode instead of a pulsative one. Therefore, We need a certain number of branchings to do the transition from pulsative to continuous mode of transportation, which implies that no mammal can be smaller than a few centimeters. Indeed, the smallest mammal is the shrew (around 4 cm).
- On the opposite side, there is a limit to how big a mammal can be. When we look at the capillaries, they can only distribute energy to a given adjacent volume: if a cell is too far from the capillary, it will not be delivered in oxygen and will die. This limit the upper size of a mammal around the size of the blue whale.
