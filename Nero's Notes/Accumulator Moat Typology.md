# Accumulator Moat Typology


## Attributes
- Focus on asset-light businesses, smaller is better.
- **Recurring revenues**
- GDP+ growth industry
- **Disciplined valuation approach**
- Good incentive structure
- **Decentralized organization model**
- Good oversight over acquired businesses: standardized control environment where each individual business is ranked against each other.
- Sellers often ascribe greater value to seeing their business carry on as an independent subsidiary, rather than selling to the highest bid.
- Provides expertise and resources:
	- R&D was too risky before and becomes now possible
	- Sharing of best practices amongst all subsidiaries of the company
- Very often due to the high number of acquisitions, availability of bases rates for:
	- Acquisition multiple hypothesis
	- A/B testing, small experiences in one vertical that can be applied to the rest of the company if successful


## Culture
- Needs best practices around:
	- Target discovery
	- Relationship management
	- Due diligence
	- Valuation
	- Integration
	- Ongoing monitoring
	  
	  
- Need to be clear with the fit of the target business. Ex: "The business fits on product, market, culture and ambition, but is weak on pricing and working capital."


## Risk
- Large deals are the fastest path to mediocre returns for accumulators
- How can M&A activities be done at large scale

### Other points from [[Demesne Investments]]

See [[Practice Makes Perfect]]

- **Acquisitions of Small, Private Companies.** How large are a company’s typical acquisitions? Does it have a structure in place that can scale the number of transactions without going too far up in size?
- **Counting Business Units.** How many business units (not brands) does the company have? How many does management think they could have in the future? What proportion of acquisitions become their own business units?
- **Human-Scale Business Units**. How big is the typical business unit (in employees, revenue, etc.)? How small is too small, and how big is too big? Do business units regularly get split to maintain focus and nimbleness?
- **Decentralized M&A**. How centralized is the M&A process around the C-suite? What is the team’s transaction volume capacity? How are division and business unit managers involved in prospecting, if at all? Are there multiple concentric M&A teams throughout the organization? At what level of the company are most transactions executed?
- **Synergy Restraint.** Is it the largest or the smallest acquisitions that are subject to the most disruptive integrations?
- **Redundant Functional Roles**. Do acquired companies have mass layoffs? Are roles like R&D, Marketing, Sales, etc. consolidated across business units? What global functional heads, if any, reside at the head office?
- **Evidence-Based Targets and Strategies**. Are the business unit managers given clear financial and KPI targets? Are strategies imposed, or are they suggested based on evidence from other business units? Do the business units have the freedom to hit their targets in their own way?
- **Coaches versus Players**. Do Division/Operating Group Presidents manage more like coaches or players? When different business units collaborate, is it willingly or by imposition?
- **Pricing Strategies Post Acquisition**. Does there tend to be pricing/monetization changes in the business unit post acquisition?
- **Shareholder Stewardship**. Is the standard by which the Board and management spend shareholders’ money more stringent than how they would spend their own? Have there been any major changes in the Board or management team recently?
