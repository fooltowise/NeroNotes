# Capital Allocation, Compounding, and the need for reinvention

See [[Capital Allocation]], [[Mergers and Acquisitions]], [[Serial Acquirers]]


Future investment is essential, in ways people don't always understand. The key to long-term success is creating a powerful advantage over rivals, which is necessary for survival when the inevitable crisis hits. Whether it's superior quality in technically complex products, marketing prowess, or advantaged distribution networks, these don't come right away. Companies have to build a moat with sustained investments in competitively important areas. If done well, those investments should eventually yield ever-higher results. More profits, invested at the higher rate of return generated by the moat, lead to even more profits, and so on - the power of compounding - on the flywheel.


Companies can invest cash internally in operations and new products or externally in acquisitions; it depends on the opportunities available. The key is to generate returns that investment, translated into cash flow, that show compounding growth in profits. Better yet, companies that master capital deployment (by regularly shifting in search of the higher return: organic growth, acquisitions, dividends, or share repurchases) win lower funding costs as investors pay up for that success and debt rating agencies see better execution. Lower funding costs result in greater compounding, which gives those companies the essential resilience to survive over long periods, particularly important in periods of unexpected disruption like the one we are currently experiencing with this year's pandemic.

As an illustration, suppose a company boosts revenues at the same rate as GDP, say 3 percent, and is competent at manufacturing. It could raise profits by 5 to 6 percent annually simply with disciplined operating improvements. But if the company consistently allocates the cash to opportunities with a solid return profile, then eventually it should start seeing profits rise by a meaningfully higher rate, say 8 to 9 percent annually. And if the company pursues businesses with a growth rate higher than the GDP, then it can achieve double-digit growth in profits. Double digit growth is what puts a company well into the top quartile of a wide peer group, typically. A target worth pursuing.


That growth algorithm can prove particularly important in keeping investors interested during times of stock market distress. The spread between stocks that hold value and those that get punished severely becomes even more acute in tough times. And that's largely a function of the ability to hold profits and cash flow stable when conditions deteriorate. Compounders like [[Danaher]], [[Roper]], and [[TransDigm]], even in their more cyclical pasts, were each able to limit downside during recessionary periods. And while we can't be certain exactly how they'll come through this most recent global crisis, we have confidence that they'll come out better than their peers.

Clearly though, the upside math is most compelling when business conditions are stable. An investment with 10 percent compounding growth, all else being equal, should double in value every 7 years, while one with 5 percent growth would take 14 years. The rewards of compounding growth are enormous, and there are many paths to get there. The main idea is to treat cash as investors do: dispassionately looking for the best return, not what builds an empire. Vanity deals never work. Deals done for defensive reasons are also usually doomed. And "game changing" is normally the path to "game over".

How can companies achieve compounding? Operational discipline is essential. If every employee and piece of manufacturing equipment improves by even just 1 percent a year, then returns will see an impact. And productivity gains of 2 to 3 percent per year are often seen by those with true continuous improvement cultures. Those are the companies that really shine over time.

Surprisingly, compounding is not explicit in the business model of many firms today. They prefer to work on strategic investments with highly uncertain returns, or they lack the organizational strength to act decisively and shift allocation in meaningful ways. They hide behind the view that balanced deployment is best. Balance may make some sense as it relates to risk control. Still, you get there not at any particular moment, but by heavily weighting one area over others when the time is right - such as outsized share repurchases or M&A during periods of stock market or economic weakness, or debt pay-down and a tilt toward internal investment when deals are less interesting and valuations are high.

Some companies elect to change the complexion, business model, and collective mindset of the entire organization. We've seen companies that were once firmly planted in the industrial world migrated elsewhere. For example, [[Danaher]] pivoted from a legacy tools company to a healthcare company through bold spin-offs and opportunistic deals. Honeywell tossed aside its best-known business line, thermostats, to focus on warehouse automation and software. [[Roper]] transitioned from pumps to software. But these weren't pie-in-the-sky transitions. In each case, cash flow was deployed to a higher-growth, higher-margin, more defensible, and higher-return plan, executed over a long enough time period to better manage risks inherent in big change. These examples are less common, but they're emblematic of the lengths to which the strongest companies will push forward in pursuit of building sustainable competitive advantages.
