In epistemology, Agrippa's trilemna states that when we try to explain something, we are bound to end in either of three directions:
- circular reasoning: Why A? Because of B. Why B? Because of A
- recursion, where each proof requires another proof, ad infinitum: Why A, because of B. Why B, because of C. [...] Why X, because of Yâ€¦ and so on.
- an axiom, which is an accepted assertion rather than a defended one. God is an axiom. The Big Bang is another one.
