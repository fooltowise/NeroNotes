# Confirmation Bias

Confirmation bias occurs when we overweight evidence that confirms our prior notions and underweight any evidence that contradicts it.

*"I will look at any additional evidence to confirm the opinion to which I have already come."*
*"What a man believes, he prefers to be true."*
