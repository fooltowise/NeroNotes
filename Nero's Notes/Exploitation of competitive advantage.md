# Exploitation of Competitive Advantage

The exploitation of a [[Competitive Advantage]] can take several forms. A company with captive customers can charge more than the competition does. If the advantages stem from lower costs, it can strike a balance between underpricing competitors to increase sales and charging the same to keep the full benefit of the cost advantage. So long as the firm is either alone in the market or surrounded by a myriad of smaller and weaker competitors, it can determine the appropriate price level by trial and error. It needs to monitor its steps to see which price levels and other marketing choices provide the best returns, but it does not have to worry explicitly about the reactions of particular competitors. 

To reinforce its competitive advantages, a company first has to identify their sources and then to intensify the economic forces at work. If the source of the advantage is cost advantages stemming from proprietary technologies, the company wants to improve them continually and to produce a successive wave of patentable innovations to preserve and extend existing advantages. the practice here is again a matter of organizational effectiveness, including making sure that investments in research and developments are productive. 

If the source is customer captivity, the company wants to encourage habit formation in new customers, increase switching costs, and make the search for alternatives more complicated and difficult. For expensive items, it wants to make purchases more frequent and to spread payments out over time, to ensnare the customer in an ongoing relationship that is easier to continue than to replace.
