# Picking DNA's Locks

Because they are so short-lived compared with their hosts, parasites can be quicker to evolve and adapt. In about ten years, genes of the AIDS  virus change as much as human genes in ten million years. For bacteria, thirty minutes can be lifetime. Human beings, whose generations are an eternal thirty years long, are evolutionary tortoises.

Evolutionary tortoises none the less do more genetic mixing that evolutionary hares. Austin Burt's discovery of a correlation between generation length and amount of recombination is evidence of the Red Queen at work. The longer your generation time, the more genetic mixing you need to combat your parasites. Bell and Burt also discovered that the mere present of a rogue parasitic chromosome called a B-chromosome is enough to induce extra recombination (more genetic mixing) in a species. Sex seems to be an essential part of combating parasites. But how?

Leaving aside for the moment such things as fleas and mosquitoes, let us concentrate on viruses, bacteria and fungi, the causes of most diseases. they specialize in breaking into cells, either to eat them, as fungi and bacteria do, or like viruses, to subvert their genetic machinery for the purpose of making new viruses. Either way, they must get into cells. To do that they employ protein molecules that fit into other molecules on cell surfaces: in the jargon, they bind. The arms races between parasites and their hosts are all about these binding proteins.

Parasites invent new keys; hosts change the locks. there is an obvious group-selectionist argument here for sex: at any one time a sexual species will have lots of different locks; members of an asexual one will have the same locks. So a parasite with the right key will quickly exterminate the asexual species but not the sexual one. Hence the well-known fact that by turning our fields over to monocultures of increasingly inbred strains of wheat and maize we are inviting the very epidemics of disease that can only be fought by the pesticides we are forced to use in ever larger quantities.

The Red Queen's case is both subtler and stronger than that, though. It is that an individual, by having sex, can produce offspring more likely to survive than an individual that produces clones of itself. The advantage of sex can appear in a single generation. this is because whatever lock is common in one generation will produce among the parasites the key that fits it. So you can be sure that it is the very lock not to have a few generations later. For by then the key that fits it will be common. Rarity is a premium.

Sexual species can call on a sort of library of locks that is unavailable to asexual species. This library is known by two long words which mean roughly the same thing: heterozygosity and polymorphism. They are the things that animals lose when their lineage become inbred. What they mean is that in the population at large (polymorphism) and in each individual as well (heterozygosity) there are different versions of the same gene at any one time. The polymorphic blue and brown eyes of westerners are a good example: many brown eyed people carry the recessive gene for blue eyes as well - they are heterozygous. 

Such polymorphisms are almost as puzzling as sex to true Darwinists because they imply that one gene is as good as the other. Surely, if brown eyes were marginally better than blue (or, more to the point, if normal genes were better than sickle-cell anemia cells) then one would have gradually driven the other extinct. So why on earth are we stuffed full of so many different versions of genes? Why is there so much heterozygosity? 

In the case of sickle-cell anemia it is because the sickle gene helps to defeat malaria, so the heterozygotes (those with one normal gene and one sickle gene) are better off than those with normal genes where malaria is common, whereas the homozygotes (those with two normal genes or two sickle genes) suffer from malaria and anemia respectively.
