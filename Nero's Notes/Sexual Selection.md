# Sexual Selection

The theory of sexual selection was a truly extraordinary, outside-the-box idea, and it still is; once you understand it, a whole host of behaviors that were previously baffling or seemingly irrational suddenly make perfect sense. The ideas that emerge from sexual selection theory explain not only natural anomalies such as the peacock's tail, but also the popularity of many seemingly insane human behaviors and tastes, from the existence of [[Veblen goods]] such as caviar, to more mundane absurdities such as the typewriter.
