# The seven deadly sins of banking

### 1) Imprudent asset-liability mismatch on the balance sheet
Borrowing at short-term maturities to lend at long term ones can be very dangerous. During the boom years at the beginning of the century, Irish banks financed household mortgages that had a contractual maturity of two decades or more, with commercial paper of less than one year's duration. This turned sour as soon as they could not have access to capital anymore.


### 2) Supporting asset-liability mismatches by clients
The classic example is foreign currency lending to households in Central European countries. Not long ago, European banks were providing low interest euro and Swiss franc mortgages to Hungarian and Latvian consumers. It was unlikely these customers understood the foreign exchange risk they were running.

### 3) Lending to "Can't pay, Won't pay" types
One immediately thinks of banks lending to subprime borrowers and private equity firms. From time to time, the banking industry becomes obsessed with earning a few extra basis points of spread each quarter, while losing sight of credit risk, namely the chance that borrowers might never be in a position to repay the principal.

### 4) Reaching for growth in unfamiliar areas
A number of European banks have lost billions investing in US subprime CDOs (UBS has blown $40 billion in this manner), having foolishly relied on *experts* who told them that these were riskless AAA.  In Scandinavia, many banks pursued growth in the Baltic states and have suffered as GDP in the region has contracted by 15-20 percent this year (house prices in Latvia are now down 70% from the peak).

### 5) Engaging in off-balance sheet lending
Recent examples include the use of conduits and SIVs by European banks. 

### 6) Getting sucked in virtuous/vicious cycle dynamics
Never be seduced by what might be termed [[Three degrees of lending behavior| Ponzi Economics]].  Lending by Scandinavian banks in the Baltic states seemed like a good idea  for a long time partly because GDP was growing rapidly. The strong economic growth, however, was a function of rapidly growing credit supplied by the banks themselves. The fact that every bank was lending in the same market made it feel safe, and for a while the virtuous cycle continued. Real Estate markets around the world were similarly characterized by the notion that asset quality was independent of credit conditions.  [[Lending Death Cycle]]

### 7) Relying on the rear-view mirror
A recent expression of this common financial vice includes the widespread use of value-at-risk models. Such models tend to be based on a limited amount of historic data, which in the years before the great financial crisis were relatively benign. True risk was understated. In its 207 annual report, Merril Lynch reported a total risk exposure - based on a "95% confidence interval and a one day holding period" - of $157m. A year later, the Thundering Herd stumbled into a $30 billion loss!  After house prices have risen by 85% in the United States in ten years, was it realistic to expect a maximum  decline of 13.4% (Freddie Mac's worst case scenario)? 


**Note**: all of this applies only to honest businesses. On the contrary, [[Profile of Control Frauds| Control Frauds]] will actively engage in those sins to increase quickly their (fictitious) earnings.
