# Arouse an Eager Want


It is necessary to "*bait the hook to suit the fish*".
Why talk about what we want? This is childish. Of course, you are interested in what you want. You are eternally interested in it. But no one else is. The rest of us are just like you: we are interested in what we want. **So the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.**

> If you want to convince, appeal to interest, not to reason. - Benjamin Franklin

**First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.**


Henry Ford used to say: "**If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own.**"


"People who can put themselves in the place of other people who can understand the workings of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for them."
If out of reading this book you get just one thing - an increased tendency to think always in terms of other people's point of view, and see things from their angle  - if you get that one thing out of this book, it may easily prove to be one of the building blocks of your career.
