# Philip Fisher's 15 points

## The fifteen points to look for in a common stock

1. Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible sizable increase in sales for at least several years? Does it come from a "fortunate and able" management (i.e benefiting from industry tailwinds), or "fortunate because they are able" management (i.e [[Intelligent Fanatics]])?

2. Does the management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will still further increase total sales potentials when the growth potentials of currently attractive product lines have largely been exploited?


Point 1 is about current product potential, point 2 is about being able to create future products that will be as attractive (or more attractive) as the current ones.

3. How effective are the company's research and development efforts in relation to its size?

4. Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
5. Does the company has a worthwhile profit margin?
6. What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins (i.e what is the direction of the moat? (See [[Paul Black on Moat Direction]]))
7. Does the company have outstanding labor and personal relations?
8. Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
9. Does the company have depth to its management?
10. How good are the company's cost analysis and accounting controls?
11. Are there other aspects of the business, somewhat peculiar to the industry involved, which will give the investor important clues as to how outstanding the company may be in relation to its competition? (*)
12. Does the company have a short-range or a long-range outlook in regard to profits?
13. In the foreseeable future will the growth of the company require sufficient equity financing so that the large number of shares then outstanding will largely cancel the existing stockholders' benefit from this anticipated growth?
14. Does the management talk freely to investors about its affairs when things  are going well but "clam up" when troubles and disappointments occur?
15. Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?









(*)  For example, a few years ago when it was a much smaller company organization than as of today, a young West Coast electronic manufacturer had great success with a new product. one of the giants of the industry made what was described to me as a "Chinese copy" and marketed it under its well-known trade name. In the opinion of the young company's designer, this large competitor managed to engineer all the small company's engineering mistakes into the model along with the good points. The large company's model came out at just the time the small manufacturer introduced its own improved model with the weak points eliminated. With a product that was not selling, the large company withdrew from the field. As has been true many times before and since, **it is the constant leadership in engineering, not patents, that is the fundamental source of protection**. The investor must be at least as careful not to place too much importance on patent protection as to recognize its significance in those occasional places where it is a major factor in appraising the attractiveness of a desirable investment.
