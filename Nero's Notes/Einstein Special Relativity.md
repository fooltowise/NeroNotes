# Einstein's Special Relativity
Maxwell's equations were a true breakthrough in physics during the second part of the 19th century and allowed to unify the theories of light, electricity and magnetism. One particular consequence of Maxwell's equations is that the velocity of light in a vacuum is constant (300'000 km/s). And this, independently of the referential chosen to measure it.

However, the fact that light velocity is constant in any referential was an issue. It went against the principle of relativity. For instance, if a spaceship is traveling at a speed u, and light is emitted from the rear of the spaceship - going backwards - and an external observer would measure the speed of the signal, we would expect the measured velocity to be c - u, hence we could deduce the velocity of the spaceship (which is against the principle of relativity).

Many scientists tried to implement similar experiment to prove this fact. In particular, Michelson and Morley set up in 1887 an experiment to deduce from the speed of light at which velocity the earth was traveling. But the results were surprising: whatever the experiment, the results were always c-u = c, which means that in principle the velocity of the moving referential was zero. The principle of relativity was respected, but either Maxwell's equations were wrong, or classical mechanics (Newton's laws) were wrong.

Einstein decided that Maxwell's equations were correct, and suggested, alongside Poincarr√©, to amend the laws of mechanics so that the experimental results would be explained.

In particular, Lorentz, discovered that, if a referential S' with coordinates (x',y',z',t') is moving from another referential S with coordinates (x,y,z,t) with a uniform velocity u, the following transformation would make Maxwell's equations compliant with the principle of relativity:
$$ x' = \frac{x - u t}{\sqrt{1-\frac{u^2}{c^2} }} $$
$$y' = y $$
$$ z' = z$$
$$ t' = \frac{t - \frac{u x}{c^2}}{\sqrt{1-\frac{u^2}{c^2} }}  $$

Einstein used this transformation to show that the only modification needed for Newton's equation to follow the principle of relativity when the speed of light is involved is to transform the formula of the mass. The mas is not constant anymore, but is equal to:
$$ m = \frac {m_0}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{u^2}{c^2}   }} $$  where m0 is the mass at rest of the object considered.


## Consequences of Special relativity

With Einstein's and Lorentz' equations, we get some unintuitive results:
- When a referential S' is moving at a velocity u along x axis from another referential S, lengths along x are compressed in S': If an object has a lengt L in S, it will have a length 
 $$\frac {L}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{u^2}{c^2}   }}$$ in S'
- In such a referential, time is slower: If an observer Joe in S is watching somebody else (Moe) located  in S', everything that Moe will do will look slower to Joe (but Moe will not be aware of it).
- Finally, if two events are simultaneous in S', they won't be necessarily be simultaneous in S. For instance, imagine two clocks in a spaceship S' moving at a velocity u from S. One clock is at the front of the spaceship and another at the rear. Although the clocks may be synchronous for an observer inside the spaceship, they won't be at all for an observer in S: **There is failure of simultaneity**
