# System Thinking

## What is a System?


 A system is a set of elements (objects, actions, concepts, persons...) interconnected in a structured way in order to perform a characteristic behavior. This behavior is called the purpose or the function of the system.

 The purpose of the system is thus highly dependent of its structure. Usually, systems behaviors are more caused by their structures than by external factors.

 We can replace many parts in a system, as long as the interconnections remain the integrity of the system will stay. But change connections and the whole system becomes something else.

 A system has thus the tendency to stay the same over time. Keep the system going, and you will get always the same behavior and the same results.

## Basic parts of a system
### Stock and flows

A stock can be anything (tangible or intangible) that you can measure: money, motivation, water level, sunlight, time... It can accumulate or de-cumulate over time because of inflows or outflows:

- An inflow increases the quantity of the stock
- An outflow decreases the quantity of the stock
A stock is therefore the memory of all the inflows/outflows that occurred in the past.

To increase a flow, you can either increase inflows or decrease outflows (the first being often more obvious than the second).

Stocks change slowly, even if its flows can change suddenly. Thus they often act as buffers, delays or shock absorbers.

A nice feature of a stock is that it can be used to decouple inflows and outflows, so that they can be independent and in temporary disequilibrium.

### Feedback Loops

A feedback loop occurs when the level of a stock has an effect on its inflows and outflows. There is therefore a connection starting from the stock, going through a decision center whose logic is dependent on the stock level, and going back to the stock via its inflows and outflows.

The more a system's behavior is consistent over time, the more likely it is to contain feedback loops.

There are two kind of loops:
- **Balancing Feedback loops**:  They are equilibrating or goal-seeking structures; therefore they are both sources of stability and of resistance to change. The level of the stock is compared to a target level, and the discrepancy is used to correct the stock level through an action on its inflows/outflows.

- **Reinforcing Feedback loops**:  Reinforcing feedback loop are self-enhancing, resulting in exponential growth or in runaway collapse. They can be found in any stock that can reinforce or replicate itself.

### Delays

   A delay in a balancing loop is likely to introduce oscillations in a system

   Delays are pervasive in systems, and have a strong impact on the behavior of systems. Changing the length of a delay may (or may not, depending on the delay type and its relative length compared to other delays) introduce a big change in the system behavior.





## Characteristics of a system
- The ***resilience*** of a system is its capacity to recover from a perturbation, to restore and heal itself
- Systems have often a ***self-organizing*** capacity: they can structure themselves, create new structures, learn, diversify and become more complex (ex: living beings and evolution)
- Systems can be ***hierarchic***. When it is the case they can be divided in a collection of subsystems interacting together to produce the behavior of the system. Hierarchies allow system to be more resilient and stable. Another advantage is that subsystems have significantly less data to keep track of. Hierarchical systems evolve from the bottom-up. The goal of upper layers are to serve the purpose of lower layers




**A central point of system theory is that two systems having the same loop structure will have the same type of behavior, even if from outside they look different (ex: population and economy)**

**The structure of a system is the source of its behavior. The system's behavior will reveal in a series of events over time.**
