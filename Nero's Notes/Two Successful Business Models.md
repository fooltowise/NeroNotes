# Two Successful Business Models

## by Nick Sleep

Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, made the following point in a recent interview in Wired magazine:
>“There are two ways to build a successful company. One is to work very, very hard to convince customers to pay high margins [the Colgate, Nike, Coca-Cola model alluded to above]. The other is to work very, very hard to be able to offer customers low margins [the Wal-Mart, Costco, AirAsia, Amazon, [[Asos]] model]. They both work. We’re firmly in the second camp. It’s difficult – you have to eliminate defects and be very efficient. But it’s also a point of view. We’d rather have a very large customer base and low margins than a small customer base and higher margins.”

Although Mr Bezos does not mention it, one reason he prefers Amazon to be a large company with small margins is that if he shares the efficiency benefits that come with growth with his customers, he turns size, frequently an anchor on business performance, into an asset. In other words, the moat surrounding the firm deepens as the firm grows. So, having shared low costs with their customers, how are our firms’ relationships with their customers going? One way to look at this is revenue growth. The weighted average revenue growth of Nomad’s firms is currently over thirty percent per annum. Note: this is organic growth with, if anything, falling prices and no acquisitions in a time of austerity and little economic growth. It would appear to us that the company – customer relationship is in rude health.

It is not the easiest time to be an equity investor. The factors that have lead to the devaluation of equities relative to almost all other investment possibilities (perhaps with the exception of housing) have little to do with how well companies have been managed. Be that as it may, Nomad’s firms are, on average, so cost advantaged compared to many of their competitors that the worse it gets for the economy, the better it gets for our firms from a competitive position. The trick to being a good investor, over the long-term, is to maintain your long-term oriented discipline.
