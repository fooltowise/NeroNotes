# Business Ideas

## What I could do:

- AMC Consulting
- Investing website
- Manage Money
- Software/position keeping systems consulting
- [[Launching a paid newsletter]]

## What I am good at:
- Learning complicated topics
- explaining things in a logical manner
- I know a lot about equity investing
- I know from the inside out how AMCs work, and how position keeping systems work
- Developing software

## What I am interested in:
- Business analysis
- Business history
- Human psychology

## Constraints:
- Ideally, I'd work from home (not renting an office)
- I am looking for something where I have to engage as little capital as possible




## Questions to ask:
- How would I get paid for this idea?
- How much would I get paid from this idea?
- Is there a way I could get paid more than once?

## Strategies to generate ideas:
- Dig deeper to uncover hidden needs
- Make your customer a hero
- Sell what people buy
- Focus on what people really want

## What people really want:
#### More:
- Love
- Money
- Acceptance
- Free time
#### Less
- Stress
- Conflict
- Hassle
- Uncertainty (see [[People hate uncertainty]])


- *Value* means “helping people.” Our unexpected entrepreneurs discovered that when they focused on providing value above all else, their businesses were successful.
- Give people what they really want, not just what you think they should have. Give them the fish!
- The more you can market a core benefit instead of a list of features, the easier it will be to profit from your idea. Core benefits usually relate to emotional needs more than physical needs.


## Reality Checks about hobbies
- Instead of just during your free time, would you enjoy pursuing your hobby at least twenty hours a week?
- Do you enjoy teaching others to practice the same hobby?
- Do you like the ins and outs (all the details) of your hobby?
- If you had to do a fair amount of administrative work related to your hobby, would you still enjoy it?
- Have other people asked for your help?
- Are enough other people willing to pay to gain or otherwise benefit from your expertise?
- Are there other businesses serving this market (usually a good thing) but not in the same way you would?

## Your customers
- Who are your people? You don't necessarily have to think of them in categories such as age, race, and gender. Instead, you can think of them in terms of shared beliefs and values.
- You can often follow a fad, craze, or trend by establishing yourself as an authority and simplifying something about the process for others hoping to benefit from it.
- **Use surveys to understand customers and prospects.** (Google surveys, Survey Monkey). The more specific, the better. Ask: "What is the number one thing I can do for you?"
- Use the decision-making matrix to evaluate multiple ideas against one another. You don't have to choose only one idea, but the exercise can help you decide what to pursue next.

## Your Offer
- As much as possible, connect your offer to the direct benefits customers will receive. Like the Alaska coupon books, a compelling offer pays of itself by making a clear value proposition
- What people want and what they say they want are not always the same thing; your job is to figure out the difference.
- When developing an offer, think carefully about the objections and then respond to them in advance.
- Provide a nudge to customers by getting them to make a decision. The difference between a good offer and a great offer is *urgency* (also known as timeliness): Why should people act now?
- Offer reassurance and acknowledgement immediately after someone buys something or hires you. Then find a small but meaningful way to go above and beyond their expectations.



## On making money

"Remember that the goal of business is profit. It's not being liked, or having a huge social media presence, or having amazing products that nobody buys. It is not having a beautiful website, or perfectly crafted email newsletters, or an incredibly popular blog. In larger businesses, this is called accountability to shareholders. Business is not a popularity contest. The CEO doesn't get away with saying, "But look at all these people who like us on Facebook!" Shareholders will not accept that. You are the majority shareholder in your business, and you have to protect your investment. You have to make sure that your recurring activities are as directly tied to making money as possible. There's nothing wrong with having a hobby, but if you want to call it a business, you have to make money."
