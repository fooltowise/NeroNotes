# Owner Earnings vs Reported Earnings



> Owner Earnings represent:
> - (A) Reported Earnings, plus 
> - (B) Depreciation, Depletion, Amortization and certain other non-cash charges, less
>- (C) The annual averaged amount of capital expenditure for plants and equipment, etc that the business requires to fully maintain its long-term competitive position and its units volume. If the business requires additional working capital to maintain its competitive position and unit volume, the increment also should be added to (C).
> -- Warren Buffett


There are three reasons why reported earnings should differ from owner earnings:
- Capex charged to revenue and vice versa
- Depreciation and obsolescence (capital investment has to be written off because of competition)
- Changes in working capital (bargaining power of customers and suppliers)
