1. What topic am I currently focusing on?
	 Human relationships
2.  What did I learn today?
	1.  If I want to persuade:
		1.  Appeal to nobler motives
		2.  Dramatize your ideas
		3.  Throw down a challenge
	2.  If you want to lead people:
		1.  Begin with praise and honest appreciation
		2.  Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly
		3.  Praise the smallest progress
		4.  Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person
		5.  Ask questions instead of giving direct orders
		6.  Let the other person save face
3. What mistakes did I make?
	1. We had a huge failure in the family where I had an argument with Agata, and Miroslav was being a pain in the a**. At the end everybody was angry, and I feel super dumb because personal relationships is the exact thing I am trying to improve on. This one was a huge failure. I lost my nerves.
