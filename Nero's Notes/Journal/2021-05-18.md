1. What topic am I currently focusing on?
	Human Relationships
2.  What did I learn today?
	- Be genuinely interested in people. I will make more friends in two months by getting interested in them, than in two years in trying to getting them interested in me
	- Smile. A genuine smile is particularly important to be likable
	- Remember people's name. People's name is the sweetest thing to their ear, and someone who can call them by their name will be way ahead of competition.
	- See [[Smile]], [[Remember People's Name]], [[Become Genuinely Interested in Other People]]
3. What mistakes did I make?
	1. I got angry and criticized Agata, contravening the rule of [[Dont Criticize People| not criticizing people]]. But I realized it immediately and apologized right away.
