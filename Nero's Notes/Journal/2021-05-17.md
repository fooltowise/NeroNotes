- What topic am I currently focusing on?
	Human relations
-  What did I learn today?
	-  People crave for feeling important. I should praise them and show them gratitude. See [[Give Honest and Sincere Appreciation]]
	-  People will only do something if it is in their interest to do it. The best way to make someone do something is to show him what he wants and how to get it. Arouse in people an eager want. See [[Arouse an Eager Want]]

- What did I do was right - and in what way could I have improved my performance?
	- I applied today's lessons with Agata (showing sincere appreciation), and Miroslav (figuring out what he wants so that he can do what we want him to)
