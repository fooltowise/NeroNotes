	- In case of an argument:
		- Let the other person think that your idea was actually his (see [[Let the Other Person Feel that the Idea is His or Hers]])
		- Try to see from the other person's point of view
		- Be sympathetic to the other person's position. Say "If I were in your position I'd do the same" See [[Be Sympathetic with the Other Person's Ideas and Desires]]
