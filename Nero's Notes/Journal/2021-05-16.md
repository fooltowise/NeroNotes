1. What topic am I currently focusing on?
	Human relationships
2.  What did I learn today?
	- It is counterproductive to criticize. People tend to rationalize their behavior; criticism will hurt their feelings and raise resentment towards me. See [[Dont Criticize People]]
	- Stress shorten people's horizon. Therefore an investor under stress will likely discount the long term heavily, leading to severe mis-pricing. See also [[Stress Influence Tendency]]
	- Economics should not be considered as laws in equilibrium, but as a complex evolving system where agents constantly react to their environment, and new global behavior emerges, to which the same agents will react once again and so on, in a feedback loop fashion. 


3. Misc: 
	1. I recently took again personality tests. According to the MBTI test I am **[INTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality)**, while the Principles.me website classifies me as a **[Growth Seeker](https://principlesyou.com/home#How%20You%20Apply%20Yourself-Sidebar)** See also [[Growth Seeker]] and [[INTJ]]
