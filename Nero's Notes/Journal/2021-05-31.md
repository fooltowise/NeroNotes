**Who am I?**

I am a husband, father, software developer, and investor. I am a lifelong learner. I am a compounder.
What does it mean to be a compounder? Which domains benefit from compounding?
- Finances
- Health
- Relationships
- Knowledge/Wisdom
- Spirituality?
I should try to get 1% better each day in those domains.
