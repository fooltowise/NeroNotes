2.  What did I learn today?
	1.  People avoid pain and look for pleasure, especially in the short term. If we want to build a behavior with long-term benefits but short-term pain, we need to:
		1.  Acknowledge what is the short term pleasure we are getting from the current behavior
		2.  Realize the long-term pain we are getting into, and link it to our short-term behavior
		3.  Think of all the benefits and pleasure we will reap if we follow the new behavior.
