**What did I learn today?**
- If you want to cure boredom, be curious. When you're curious, nothing is a chore.
- Journaling: Write your questions before going to bed. When you wake up, journal to answer your questions without censoring yourself.

Awaken the giant within: First, get your list of top goals. Second, get clear on the "why". Third, develop the ritual of reviewing your goals and rehearsing the joy of their achievement daily for ten days. Fourth, surround yourself with role models and those who can help you develop a plan that will guide you in making it all real.


**What is my top goal for the next year?**

I want to be an expert on scale economics shared businesses by June 1st, 2022.
