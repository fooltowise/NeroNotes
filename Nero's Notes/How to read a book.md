Mortimer Adler and Charles Van Doren have written the seminal book on reading. Their *How to read a book* educates us on skills that are useful fore reading anything. Alder and Van Doren identify four levels of reading: elementary, inspectional, analytical, and syntopical. Before we can improve our reading skills, we need to understand the differences among these reading levels. They are thought of as levels because you can't move to a higher level without mastering the previous one - they are cumulative, and each level builds on the preceding one.
