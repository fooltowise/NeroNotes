# The wit and wisdom of Johann Rupert
Johann Rupert is the South-African CEO of Richemont SA.

### On Management
- The danger sign is always when a manager does not understand the business that he or she is in.
-  (On relations with a dominant supplier) Don't play cat and mouse games if you are the mouse.
-  I think if you want to be successful you need a very healthy dose of paranoia that every day there's somebody out there who wants to eat your breakfast, and if you're not alert they will do.
-  Don't postpone until tomorrow what you can delegate today.
-  I learned many years ago - that from the day you're born until you ride the hearse, things are never so bad that they can't get worse.
-  The real question is do companies redeploy free cash flow accretively, or do they waste it?

### On short-termism
- I raised a glass of Champaign when Al Dunlap fell on his chainsaw.
- So anybody who's going to ask, so what do you think the next year looks like, why don't you just not ask the question because we're not going to answer any. And it's not because we're coy or funny. We don't know.
- I'm not going to tell you what i think our third quarter XYZ is going to be.

### On M&A and Buybacks
- Ultimately, if an asset is wrongly priced, it is abused.
- If you pay an excessive multiple, deals will never make it.
- No, no, no, no. I did'nt lose a lot of money when I tried to sell the business. I lost the money when I bought the bloody thing. That's when you  park your money, it's not when you try to find a bigger idiot than you to take it off your hands.
- (On successfully exiting Pay TV) Never confuse luck with genius.
- Our job here is to create goodwill and not to pay other people for goodwill.
- There are three stages of an acquisition, which are euphoria and then disillusionment. And the next thing is looking for somebody to blame for buying the place. 
- The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. But you only find out when you climb over that the reason why it's greener is because of all the cow dung hidden in the grass. And as soon as you start stepping in all this stuff you wonder why you ever crossed the fence.
- **You can discount us ever using equity for acquisitions. Equity is always the most expensive way to pay.**
- If you look at share buybacks, and at the price at which companies bought their shares back, they inevitably bought the shares back at very close to the top of the market because that's when they had a lot of cash. And boy, do they regret it when two years later all hell breaks loose.

### On investment bankers
- **Recessions occur because the investment bankers provide capital at too low a cost which leads to overcapacity and a slump.**
- When you really need firepower, the banks are not there and the funds are gone.


### On [[Corporate governance|corporate governance]]
- So if you want a perfect governance score, get somebody you don't know, whom you never met, who knows nothing about your business because he's never been involved, employ him and give him a nice bonus for sitting on a committee. Then you get all the boxes ticked  by the proxy voting services.  And guess what happens? After five years, chaos. There's a direct, inverse correlation between the best corporate governance box-ticking and medium term performance.

### On the [[Luxury Business|luxury business]]
- The only way we know how to maintain a sustainable [[Competitive Advantage]] is to grow the brand equity... because that brand equity creates demand and will result in [[Pricing Power|pricing power ]].
- I'm just a normal business person who thinks that the luxury business is a great business to be in to create shareholder value.
- Fashion fades, only style remains the same.
- Coco Chanel years ago said that money is money is money. It's only the pockets that change. We've got to find those pockets.
- **Anniversaries, birthdays and girlfriends are always going to be there.**
- If your business model, or your [[intellectual property]], is in ones and zeros, you're going to have issues. So luckily our intellectual property resides in atoms and it is tough to wreck.
- (On brand integrity) you cannot make Ferrari's in Fiat factories.


### On China
- When the Chinese nouveau riche wants to spend, he does not want to buy Chinese
- In the east, authenticity, originality and history matters.
