# Nick Sleep on Partnership Governance

Job one, two and three for your manager is investment performance, not asset gathering. Few practice this approach. We work under the assumption that if performance is reasonable then the level of interest in what we are doing will increase and, if appropriate, the Partnership will grow in time.

Common Sense and simple maths dictate that it will be opportune if growth can be channeled to coincide with depressed prices, not market tops. We must aim for this standard, even though it is contrary to common practice in the industry.

Had we adopted the industry standard open house approach the Partnership would be approximately three times its current size, but the results worse, and the quality of Partners would be impaired.
