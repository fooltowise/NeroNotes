# The Force That Shapes Your Life

One thing is clear to me: human beings are not random creatures; everything we do, we do for a reason. We may not be aware of the reason consciously, but there is undoubtedly a single driving force behind all human behavior. This force impacts every facet of our lives, from our relationships and finances to our bodies and brains. 

What is the force that is controlling you even now and will continue to do so for the rest of your life? **PAIN and PLEASURE**. *Everything you and I do, we do either out of our need to avoid pain or our desire to gain pleasure.*

So often I hear people talk about changes they want to make in their lives. But they can't get themselves to follow through. They feel frustrated, overwhelmed, even angry with themselves because they know they need to take action, but they can't get themselves to do it. There is one elementary reason: they keep trying to change their behavior, which is the *effect*, instead of dealing with the *cause* of it.

Understanding and utilizing the forces of pain and pleasure will allow you once and for all to create the lasting changes and improvements you desire for yourself and those you care about. Failure to understand this force dooms you to a future of living in reaction, like an animal or a machine. Perhaps this sounds like a complete oversimplification, but think about it. Why don't you do some of the things you *know* you should do?

After all, what is procrastination? It's when you know you *should* do something, but you still don't *do* it. Why not? The answer is simple: at some level you believe that taking action in this moment would be more painful that just putting it off. Yet, have you ever had the experience of putting something off for so long that suddenly you felt pressure to just do it, to get it done? What happened? YOu changed what you linked pain and pleasure to. Suddenly, not taking action became more painful than putting it off. This is a common occurrence that many Americans experience around April 14...

What keeps you from approaching that man or woman of your dreams? What keeps you from starting that new business you've been planning for years? Why do you keep putting off that diet? Why do you avoid completing your thesis? Why haven't you taken control of your financial investment portfolio? What prevents you from doing whatever it takes to make your life exactly as you've imagined it?

Even though you know that all these actions would benefit you - that they could definitely bring pleasure to your life - you fail to act, simply because in that moment you associate more pain to doing what's necessary than missing the opportunity.

After all, what if you approached that person, and they reject you? What if you tried to start that new business but failed and lost the security you have in your present job? What if you started a diet and went through  the pain of starving yourself, only to gain the weight back eventually anyway? What if you made an investment and lost your money? So why even try?

**For most people, the fear of loss is much greater than the desire for gain.** The fact is that most people would work much harder to hand on to what they have than they would to take the risks necessary to get what they really want from their lives.

Often an interesting question comes up in discussions about these powers that drives us. Why is it that people can experience pain yet fail to change? They haven't experienced enough pain yet; they haven't hit what I call **emotional threshold**. If you've ever been in a destructive relationship and finally made the decision to use your personal power, take action and change your life, it was probably because you hit a *level of pain you weren't willing to settle for anymore*. We've all experienced those times in our lives when we've said: "I've had it - never again - this must change now." This is the magical moment where **pain becomes our friend.** It drives us to take new action and produce new results. We become even more powerfully compelled to act if, in that same moment, we begin to anticipate a great deal of pleasure for our lives as well.

This process is certainly not limited to relationships. Maybe you've experienced threshold with your physical condition: you finally got fed up because you couldn't squeeze into an airline seat, you couldn't fit into your clothes, and walking up a set of stairs winded you. Finally you said, "I've had it!" and made a decision. (see [[Decisions -  The Pathway to Power]]). What motivated that decision? It was the desire to remove pain from your life and establish pleasure once again: the pleasure of pride, the pleasure of comfort, the pleasure of self-esteem, the pleasure of living life the way you've designed it.

Of course, there are many levels of pain and pleasure. For example, feeling a sense of humiliation is a rather intense form of emotional pain. Feeling a sense of inconvenience is also pain. So is boredom. Obviously some of these have less intensity, but they still factor in the equation of decision-making. Likewise, pleasure weighs into this process. Much of our drive in life comes from our anticipating that our actions will lead to a more compelling future, that today's work will be well worth the effort, that the rewards of pleasure are near. Yet there are many levels of pleasure as well. For example, the pleasure of ecstasy, while most would agree is intense, may sometimes be outweighed by the pleasure of comfort. It all depends on an individual's perspective.



### Life's most important lesson
 The most important lesson we learn in life is what creates pain for us and what creates pleasure. This lesson is different for each of us and, therefore, so are our behaviors.
 
 One decision that has made a tremendous difference in the quality of my life is that at an early age I began to link incredible pleasure to learning. I realized that discovering ideas and strategies that could help me to shape human behavior and emotion could give me virtually everything I wanted in my life. It could get me out of pain and into pleasure. Learning to unlock the secrets behind our actions could help me to become more healthy, to feel better physically, to connect more deeply with the people I cared about. 
 
 Learning provided me with something to give, the opportunity to truly contribute something of value to all those around me. It offered me a sense of joy and fulfillment. At the same time, I discovered an even more powerful form of pleasure, and that was achieved by sharing what I'd learned in a passionate way. When I began to see that what I could share helps people increase the quality of their lives, I discovered the ultimate level of pleasure! And my life's purpose began to evolve.
 
 What are some of the experiences of pain and pleasure that have shaped your life? Whether you've linked pain or pleasure to drugs, for example, certainly has effected your destiny. So have the emotions you've learned to associate to cigarettes and alcohol, relationships, or even the concepts of giving and trusting.
 
 
 Can our pain and pleasure linkages produce a processional effect in our lives? You bet. A negative neuro-association for beer affected many of my decisions in life. It influenced whom I hung out with at school. It determined how I learned to get pleasure. I didn't use alcohol: I used learning; I used laughter; I used sports. 
 
 
 What can we learn from this? Simply this: **if we link massive pain to any behavior or emotional pattern, we will avid indulging in it at all costs. We can use this understanding to harness the force of pain and pleasure to change virtually anything in our lives**, from a pattern of procrastination to drug use. 
 
 
 We are the only beings on the planet who lead such rich internal lives that it's not the events that matter most to us, but rather, it's how we interpret those events that will determine how we think about ourselves and how we will act in the future. One of the things that makes us so special is our marvelous ability to *adapt*, to transform, to manipulate objects or ideas to produce something more pleasing or useful. And foremost among our adaptive talents is the ability to take the raw experience of our lives, relate it to other experiences, and create from it a kaleidoscopic tapestry of meaning that's different from everyone else's in the world. Only human beings can, for example, change their associations so that physical pain will result in pleasure, or vice-versa.
 
 
 Through the power of our wills, then, we can for instance weigh something like the physical pain of starvation (hunger strike) against the psychic pain of surrendering our ideals. We can create higher meanings; we can step out of the Skinnerian box and take control. **But if we fail to direct our own associations to pain and pleasure, we're living no better than animals or machines**, continually reacting to our environment, allowing whatever comes up next to determine the direction and quality of our lives. We're back in the box. It's as if we are a public computer, with easy access for a lot of amateur programmers!
 
 Our behavior, both conscious and unconscious, has been rigged by pain and pleasure from so many sources: childhood peers, moms and dads, teachers, coaches, movie and television heroes, and the list goes on. You may or may not know when programming and conditioning occurred. It might have been something someone said, an incident at school, an award-winning sports event, or maybe failing grades. All of these contributed to who you are today. I cannot emphasize strongly enough that **what you link pain and pleasure to will shape your destiny.**
 
 As you review your own life, can you recall experiences that formed your neuro-associations and thus set in motion the chain of causes and effects that brought you to where you are today? What meaning do you attach to things? If you're single, do you look upon marriage wistfully as a joyous adventure with your life's mate, or do you dread it as a heavy ball and chain? As you sit down to dinner tonight, do you consume food matter-of-factly as an opportunity to refuel your body, or do you devour it as you sole source of pleasure?
 
 
 Though we'd like to deny it, the fact remains that **what drives our behavior is instinctive reaction to pain and pleasure, not intellectual calculation**. Intellectually, we may believe that eating chocolate is bad for us, but we'll still reach for it. Why? Because we're not driven so much by what we intellectually know, but rather by what we've learned to link pain and pleasure to *in our nervous systems*. It's our **neuro-associations** - the associations we've established in our nervous systems - that determine what we'll do. *Although we'd like to believe it's our intellect that really drives us, in most cases our emotions - the sensations that we link to our thoughts - are what truly drives us.*
 
 Many times we try to override the system. For a while we stick to a diet; we've finally pushed ourselves over the edge because we have so much pain. **We will have solved the problem for the moment - but if we haven't eliminated the cause of the problem, it will resurface.**
 
 Ultimately, in order for a change to last, we must link pain to our old behavior and pleasure to our new behavior, and condition it until it's consistent. Remember, we will all do more to avoid pain then we will to gain pleasure. Going on a diet and overriding our pain in the short term y pure willpower never lasts simply because we still link pain to giving up fattening foods. For this change to be long term, we've got to link pain to eating those foods so that we no longer even desire them, and pleasure to eat more of the foods that nourish us. People who are fit and healthy believe that nothing tastes as good as thin feels! And they love foods that nourish them.
 
 **The truth is that we can learn to condition our minds, bodies, and emotions to link pain or pleasure to whatever we choose. By changing what we link pain and pleasure to, we will instantly change our behaviors.** With smoking, for instance, all you must do is link enough pain to smoking and enough pleasure to quitting. YOu have the ability to do this right now, but you might not exercise this capability because you've trained your body to link pleasure to smoking, or you fear that stopping would be too painful. Yet, if you meet anyone who has stopped, you will find that this behavior changed in one day: the day they truly changed what smoking meant to them.
 
 
 ## If you don't have a plan for your life, someone else does
 
 The mission of Madison Avenue is to influence what we link pain and pleasure to. Advertisers clearly understand that what drives us is not so much our intellect as the sensations that we link to their products. As a result, they've become experts in learning how to use exciting or soothing music, rapid or elegant imagery, bright or subdued color, and a variety of other elements to put us in certain emotional states; then, when our emotions are at their peak, when the sensations are their most intense, they flash an image of their product continuously until we link it to these desired feelings.

Note from Julien: I don't totally agree. See [[Ads dont work that way]].

Consider this: **Any time we're in an intense emotional state, when we're feeling strong sensations of pain or pleasure, anything unique that occurs consistently will become neurologically linked.** Therefore, in the future, whenever that unique thing happens again, the emotional state will return. 

See [[Operant Conditioning]] and [[Influence from Mere Association Tendency]].

What we've got to realize is that is all based on linking pleasurable sensations to specific behaviors. It's the idea that if we use the product, we'll live our fantasies. Advertisers have taught all of us that if you drive a BMW, then you're an extraordinary person with exceptional taste. If you drive a Hyundai, you're intelligent and frugal. If you drive a Pontiac, you'll have excitement. If you drive a Toyota, what a feeling you'll get! YOu're taught that if you wear Obsession Cologne, you'll soon be entwined in the throes of an androgynous orgy. If you drink Pepsi, you'll be able to jam with M.C Hammer as the epitome of hip. If you want to be a "good" mom, then you feed your children Hostess fruit pies, cupcakes and Twinkies.

Advertisers have noted that if enough pleasure can be generated, consumers are often willing to overlook the fear of pain. It is an advertising adage that "sex sells". and there's no question that the pleasurable associations created in print and on TV by using sex do the job. Take a look at the trend in selling blue jeans. What are blue jeans, anyway? They used to be work pants: functional, ugly. How are they sold today? They've become an international icon of everything that's sexy, fashionable, and youthful. Have you ever watched a Levi's 501 commercial? Can you explain one to me? They make no sense, do they? They're totally confusing. But at the end, you have the distinct impression that sex took place nearby. Does this type of strategy really sell blue jeans? You bet! Levi is the number one blue-jeans manufacturer in America today.

The force that shapes world opinion and consumer's buying habits is also the same force that shapes *all* of our actions. It's up to you and me to take control of this force and decide on our own actions consciously, because if we don't direct our own thoughts, we'll fall under the influence of those who would condition us to behave in the way they desire. Sometimes those actions are what we would have selected anyway; sometimes not. 

Advertisers understand how to change what we link pain and pleasure to by changing the sensations we associate to their products. If we want to take control of our lives, we must learn to "advertise" in our own minds - and we can do this *in a moment*. 

How? **Simply by linking pain to the behaviors we want to stop at such a high level of emotional intensity that we won't even *consider* those behaviors any longer.** Aren't there things you would never, ever do? Thin of the sensations you link to those. If you link those same feelings and sensations to the behaviors you want to avoid, you'll never do them again, either. 

Then, **Simply link pleasure to the new behavior you desire for yourself.** Through repetition and emotional intensity, you can condition these behaviors within yourself until they are automatic.

> I conceive that pleasures are to be avoided if greater pains be the consequence, and pains to be coveted that will terminate in greater pleasures - Michel de Montaigne.


The problem is that most of us base our decisions about what to do on what's going to create pain or pleasure in the *short term* instead of the long term. Yet, in order to succeed, most of the things that we value require us to be able to break through the wall of short-term pain in order to have long-term pleasure. You must put aside the passing moment of terror and temptation, and focus on what's most important in the long term: your values and personal standards. 

Remember, too, that **it's not actual pain that drives us, but our fear that something will lead to pain. And it's not actual pleasure that drives us, but our belief that somehow taking a certain action will lead to pleasure.** We're not driven by reality, but by our *perception* of reality.

Most people focus on how to avoid pain and gain pleasure in the short term, and thereby create long-term pain for themselves. Let's consider an example. Say someone wants to lose a few extra pounds. On the one hand, this person marshals a host of excellent reasons for losing weight: they would feel healthier and more energized; they would fit into their clothes better; they would feel more confident around members of the opposite sex. On the other hand, though, there are just as many reasons to avoid losing weight: they'd have to go on a diet; they'd continually feel hungry; they'd have to deny their urge to eat fattening foods; and besides, why not wait until *after* the holidays?

With the reasons balanced this way, many people would tip the scales in favor of the pattern of putting things off - the potential pleasure of a slimmer figure far outweighed by the short-term pain of dietary deprivation. Short term, we avoid the pain of feeling a twinge of hunger, and instead we give ourselves that immediate morsel of pleasure by indulging in a few potato chips, but it doesn't last. In the long term, we feel worse about ourselves, not to mention the fact that it causes our health to deteriorate.

Remember, anything you want that's valuable requires that you break through some short-term pain in order to gain long-term pleasure. If you want a great body, you've got to sculpt that body, which requires breaking through short-term pain. Once you've done it enough times, working out becomes pleasurable. Dieting works the same way. Any type of discipline requires breaking through pain: discipline in business, relationships, personal confidence, fitness, and finances. 

How do you break through the discomfort and create the momentum to really accomplish your aims? Start by making the decision to overcome it. We can *always* decide to override the pain in the moment, and better yet is to follow up by conditioning ourselves, which is something we'll cover in detail in Chapter 6.

Why do people persist in an unsatisfying relationship, unwilling either to work toward solutions or end it and move on? It's because they know changing will lead to the unknown, and most people believe that the unknown will be much more painful than what they're already experiencing. It's like the old proverbs say: "Better the devil you know than the devil you don't know", "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush". These core beliefs keep us from taking the actions that could change our lives.


If we want to have an intimate relationship, then we have to overcome our fears of rejection and vulnerability. If we're planning to go into business, we must be willing to overcome our fear of losing security to make that happen. In fact, most of the things that are valuable in our lives *require us to go against the basic conditioning of our nervous systems.* 

We must damage our fears by overriding this preconditioned set of responses and, in many cases, we must transform that fear into power. many times, the fear that we are allowing to control us never becomes reality anyway.

We must make sure that we live our lives in the present and respond to things that are real, not to our fears of what once was or what might someday be. the key thing to remember is that we don't move away from *real* pain; we move away from what we *believe* will lead to pain.


### Let's make some changes right now

**First, write down four actions that you need to take that you've been putting off.** Maybe you need to lose some weight. Maybe you need to stop smoking. Maybe you need to communicate with someone you've had a falling out with, or reconnect with someone who's important to you.


**Second, under each of these actions, write down the answer to the following questions: Why haven't I taken action? In the past, what pain have I linked to taking this action?** Answering these questions will help you understand that what has held you back is that you've associated greater pain to taking the action than to not taking it. Be honest with yourself. If you're thinking, "I have no pain associated to it", think a little harder. Maybe the pain is simple: maybe it's the pain of taking time out of your busy schedule.


**Third, write down all the pleasure you've had in the past by indulging in this negative pattern.** For example, if you think you should lose some weight, why have you continued to eat whole pans of brownies and bulk-size bags of chips, and to guzzle twelve-packs of soda pop? You're avoiding the pain of depriving yourself yes, and at the same time you're really doing this because it makes you feel good right now. It gives you pleasure!  Instant pleasure!  No one wants to give up these feelings!  In order to create a change that will last, we need to find a new way to get the same pleasure without any negative consequences. Identifying the pleasure you've been getting will help you know what your target is.

**Fourth, write down what it will cost you if you don't change now.** What will happen if you don't stop eating so much sugar and fat? If you don't stop smoking? If you don't make that phone call that you know you need to make? If you don't start consistently working out everyday? Be honest with yourself. What's it going to cost you over the next two, three four, five years? What's going to cost you emotionally? What's going to cost you in terms of your self-image? What will it cost you in terms of your physical energy level? What will it cost you in your feeling of self-esteem? What will it cost you financially? What will it cost you in your relationships with the people you care about the most? **How does that make you feel?** Don't just say, "It will cost me money", or "I will be fat". That's not enough. You've got to remember that what drives us is our emotions. So get associated and use pain as your friend, one that can drive you to a new level of success.


**The final step is to write down all the pleasure you'll receive by taking each of these actions *right now***. Make a huge list that will drive you emotionally, that will really get you excited: "I'll gain the feeling of really being in control of my life, of knowing that I'm in charge. I'll gain a new level of self-confidence. I'll gain physical vitality and health. I'll be able to strengthen all my relationships. I'll develop more willpower which I could use in every other area of my life. My life will be better in all these ways, now. Over the next two, three, four, five years. By taking this action, I will live my dream." Envision all the positive impacts both in the present and in the long term.
