# Toll Roads

Many large industries are served by niche suppliers whose services or products may represent a relatively immaterial proportion of that industry's cost base, but which are crucial to its successful operation. This position of being a small, but vital, cog helps to create significant barriers to entry; often meaning that suppliers' own competitive landscapes are oligopolistic and stable rather than broad-based and unpredictable. Good examples include companies in fields such as professional certification (auditing, rating agencies, product testing) and specialty ingredients (for products as diverse as yogurt or motor oil). **Companies in such niches benefit by extracting part of the economics from every unit of volume in a larger, often relatively stable, industry.** We call them *toll roads*.

Toll roads can take many forms:
- [[Gold standards]]
- [[Magic Ingredients]]

### Industry structure and economics

Toll-road companies are typically oligopolies, not monopolies. While customers and governments perceive value from few producers versus innumerable rivals, a sole supplier presents a cost to competition that is too great to pay.  Hence there are four global financial auditing firms, four industrial gas providers, three major credit rating agencies and three main testing companies.  The lack of monopoly and substantial uniformity of products suggests that participants understand that they will be competing against each others for decades to come. That understanding leads to healthy competitive behavior rather than mutually destructive manoeuvring. (see [[Rationality mechanics in an industry]])


### The economics of a toll bridge

> In an inflationary world, a toll bridge would be a great thing to own because you've laid out the capital costs. You built it in old dollars, and you on't have to keep replacing it. - [[Warren Buffett]]


Buffett tells us that the fundamental economics of a toll bridge are excellent. What are the reasons that make a toll bridge a very good business model?
- There is usually no alternative. People who have to move from A to B, have to use it. The owner of the toll bridge won't let you through unless you *pay the toll*. That's the key phrase: *pay the toll*. 
- Even if there is an alternative, people still prefer to use the toll bridge. That's because *in the mind of the user*, it does not make sense to use the alternative. Now there can be all kinds of reasons why people prefer to use a toll bridge instead of an alternative. For example, the alternative might be too far, too crowded, too risky (crime-ridden) or too expensive. There may be other reasons as well but the key thing to remember is that the preference is *in the mind of the user*.

Now let's think about what really happens on a toll bridge. If you stand at a vantage point high above the bridge, what do you see? Well, you see *movement*. You see *traffic*. And you see the toll barrier, i.e the *gateway*. There has to be a gateway owned by someone and used by someone else to pass through. Vehicles passing through have to pay a toll. The toll keeper collects the money and opens the gate. Most of his effort came in making the toll bridge. Now, all he does is open the gate and collect the toll.


In conclusions, the key points to remember are:
- Pay the toll
- in the mind of the user
- Movement
- Traffic
- Gateway
