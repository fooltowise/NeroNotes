# Friction and Viscosity

To achieve our aims, reducing resistance is often easier than using more force. While often hidden, friction and viscosity work against us whenever we try and do something. 

To overcome resistance, we often default to using more force when s**imply reducing the friction or viscosity will do.** 

Doing both is more effective than either in isolation. Friction and viscosity can also be wielded as a weapon. 

Rather than try and catch up to the competition with more effort, you might want to explore slowing them down by adding resistance.
