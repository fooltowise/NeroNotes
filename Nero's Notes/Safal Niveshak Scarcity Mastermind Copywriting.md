There are no secrets to the art of sensible stock picking that most people don’t know of. The literature has been there since the 1940s, when Ben Graham, the father of value investing, first wrote about it in his landmark book _The Intelligent Investor_.

Other practitioners of this art, like Warren Buffett, [[Charlie Munger]], Seth Klarman, Walter Schloss, and [[Howard Marks]] have been writing about it for years now.

So, you can find hundreds and thousands of resources in print and on the Internet on how you can become a smart, successful investor. However, what I found lacking ever since I started learning this art of sensible stock picking myself, was a structured, step-by-step approach to do it.

I never knew where to start and how to proceed. I could never find a mentor who would hand-hold me in my learning journey.

With this thought in mind, and after interacting with a lot of investors who were sailing in the same boat as I was, I set out nine years back to combine all my investment learning of more than a decade (now almost two decades) – both personal experiences and what I learned vicariously – to create a course that teaches its students what the world’s best investors have practiced for years i.e., Value Investing, and how they did it successfully.

I also sifted through a mountain of amazing books, documents, lectures, and other resources so that I could bring on the table just the very best ideas and lessons in investing and building wealth for other investors to learn.

And thus was born **The Safal Niveshak Mastermind** – my premium, online course in Value Investing.

Nine years later, the course has been studied by more than 10,000 investors worldwide, and has received tremendous appreciation for the quality of its content and structure, and for how it has empowered its students to become better stock market investors.

Like, here’s a student feedback I received on the forum –

**The goal of the Mastermind course is simple – To help you get richer and wiser every single day.**

## At What Price?

The Mastermind course is usually priced at ₹19999 (inclusive of GST). However, **I am offering it at ₹5000 discount – or a net price of ₹14999 – till end of day today (15th June 2022).**

A lot of past students have called Mastermind’s price being “very low compared to its intrinsic value” and thus “carrying a great margin of safety.” I would not want to comment on that, except that I know if I had such a course on offer in the early years of my investment journey, my investment trajectory could have been at a much higher orbit.

Now, I will leave that for you to decide, once you go through the [detailed curriculum, what’s on offer, and what my past students have to say about the course](https://click.mlsend.com/link/c/YT0xOTcyOTQ2MDU3NzcxODgyNjI4JmM9bDlnNSZlPTAmYj05ODIyNjcxODQmZD1yNWQxZjhw.HHXjjPSij4z2fhps0CxIMtHjvCrFKitguOeTKcjXpCs).

## World’s Best Investor’s Advice

Warren Buffett often says, _“The most important investment you can make is in yourself.”_ That could very well be the best advice he has ever offered.
