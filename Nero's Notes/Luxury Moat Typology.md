# Luxury Moat Typology



## Attributes

A luxury moat typology needs two attributes:

- Its brands must be ultra aspirational, so they can command the highest price point
- They have a total control over their distribution. They refuse to go through a wholesale channel

## Reinforcing Culture

Three values come again and again in a luxury moat: 

- Quality
- Scarcity
- Eternality

*“.. the financial strategy of a luxury brand will be to maximize not the profit, but the brand’s value and this is very different from traditional strategies.”* 

*“The luxury industry is built on a paradox: the more desirable the brand becomes, the more it sells but the more it sells, the less desirable it becomes”* 

*“History and sociology tells that there is luxury because not everybody can afford it”*
