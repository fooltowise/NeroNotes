# Your Mind as a Library

If you think of your mind as a library, three things should concern you:
1. The information you store in there - its accuracy and relevance.
2. Your ability to find/retrieve that information on demand.
3. Your ability to put that information to use when you need it - you need to be able to *apply* it.

There is no point having a repository of knowledge in your mind if you can't find and apply its content.

Here, I am reminded of what Sherlock Holmes told his accomplice, Watson, in *A study in Scarlet*:

> I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes all the lumber that he comes across, so that the knowledge that might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skillful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tolls which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.
