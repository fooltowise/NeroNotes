# Leverage
As powerful as leverage can be, we need to be deliberate about using it. Good ideas taken too far often cause unanticipated consequences. 

Wielding leverage to maximum effect all the time, as the West Virginia mine owners did, sows the seeds of ongoing unrest that undermines one's ability to be truly effective. No one wants to be exploited, and those who are never give their loyalty or their best work. 

Leverage is best paired with reciprocity - building a win-win thinking helps you keep your leverage sustainable and achieve better, longer lasting, outcomes.
