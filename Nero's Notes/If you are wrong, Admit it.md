# If you are Wrong, Admit it

If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.
Say about yourself all the derogatory things you know the other person is thinking or wants to say or intends to say - and say them before that person has a chance to say them. 

The chances are a hundred to one that a generous, forgiving attitude will be taken and your mistakes will be minimized.
