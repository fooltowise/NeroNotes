## I am trying to build wealth for my family

My priorities are to find, buy and hold great investments.

**What does NOT matter:**
- Short term events
- Trading mentality
- Short term performance
- Volatility
- Hyper Activity

**What does matter:**
*Performance of my holdings over the next five or ten years (or more) and how the value at the end of the holding period compares to the amount I invested and to my needs.*

**My most important job is to:**
- Study companies and securities, assessing things such as their earnings potential
- Buy the ones that can be purchased at attractive prices compared to their potential
- Hold onto them as long as the company's earnings outlook and the attractiveness of the price remain intact
- Make changes only when those things can't be reconfirmed, or when something better comes along.

**Kobe's blueprint:**
- Master the fundamentals
- Improve your weaknesses
- Study the greats
- Focus

## How do I learn better?

**It's not learning if it does not change behavior.**
**Structure drives behavior.**
**Therefore it's not learning if it does not change the structure of what I am doing.**

Instead of asking "How do I get this unwanted situation to go away?" you might say "What structures should I adopt to create the results I want to create?"


***The standard pace is for chumps**.* Derek Sivers.
