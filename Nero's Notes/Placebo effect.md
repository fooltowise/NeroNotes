# Placebo Effect
A placebo is a substance or treatment which is designed to have no therapeutic value. Common placebos include inert tablets (like sugar pills), inert injections (like saline), sham surgery,and other procedures.

In general, placebos affect how patients [[Progress will come from change in perception|perceive]] their condition and encourage the body's chemical processes for relieving pain.

The psychologist Nicholas Humphrey argues that placebos work by prompting the body to invest more resources in its recovery. He thinks that the immune system has an on-off switch controlled by unconscious part of the mind.

[[Evolution - Natural Selection and Extinction|Evolution]] has calibrated our immune system to suit a harsher environment than the current one.  Previously you could not risk squandering resources too hastily when there was an ever-present risk  that you might starve to death, freeze to death or be immobilized by the body's immune response.

So we need to convince our unconscious that the conditions for recovery are especially favorable in order for our immune system to work at full tilt, and this is how Placebo works.
