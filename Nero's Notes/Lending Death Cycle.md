# Lending Death Cycle 
The lending death cycle could be described as follows:
- A lender makes aggressive loans to borrowers who can only cover the interest  (see [[Three degrees of lending behavior]])
- As long as property prices grow and interest rates decline, the business grow because borrowers are able to refinance against the increased value of their property.
- However, when interest rate increase suddenly, property values go down. Borrowers are not able to cover the repayment of the principal because nobody is willing to refinance them. As a consequence, borrowers start defaulting.
- If the aggressive lender is leveraged a lot (say a loan is on average $10 million and the lending entity has a book value of $1billion), not a lot of loans have to turn sour to wipe out half of the lender's equity. As a matter of fact, only 50 such loans are enough. This does not compare well to the usual 25-50 daily new loans granted by the business. In fact, this is the story of Anglo Irish Bank who was wiped out exactly in this way.
- The usual issue is that long tail default risk occur in the long term, while usually executives have incentives based on the equity/growth in loans of the company, which leads the firm to its demise.
