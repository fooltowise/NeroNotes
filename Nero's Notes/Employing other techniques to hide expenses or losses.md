### Failing to record an expense at the appropriate amount from a current transaction

- Watch for companies that fail to account for a bill and shift it in a later quarter
- Always view cash receipts from vendors with suspicion. Cash normally flows out to vendors, not in from vendors, so unusual cash inflows from vendors may signal an accounting shenanigan
- Watch for unusually large vendors credits or rebates
- Be alert for companies failing to accrue expenses for loss contingencies
- Remember to review off-balance-sheet commitments

### Recording inappropriately low expenses by using aggressive accounting assumptions

- Be alert for self-insurance assumptions in case the company chooses to self-assure.
- Watch for changes in pension estimates and assumptions
- Watch for changes in the measurement date (especially in the pension plan)
- Watch for outsized pension income

### Reducing expenses by releasing reserves from previous charges

- Watch for earnings boosts when a company misses its bonus targets: the removal of the reserve for payment of bonus will boost earnings
- Watch for the release of restructuring reserves into income
- Many of these liability reserves (especially the generic ones) are often grouped in a "soft" liability account sometimes called "other current liabilities" or "accrued expenses". Investors should monitor soft liabilities accounts closely and flag any sharp declines relative to revenue. Often, companies discuss these soft liabilities in a footnote. Make sure to find them and track the individual reserves as well
- Watch for declines in reserves for warranties or warranty expenses
