### I’ve been invested in this gambling space for a little while and I’m always interested to learn more about what others are thinking about in terms of Evolution and its larger ecosystem.

I’ve been asked a lot recently about Evolution; there’s an awful lot of interest in it. I’m no expert on Evolution but I’ve been a customer of theirs and also with my Red Tiger hat on, they’ve ended up with Red Tiger as part of their business so I know about it from that perspective. I’m not an expert on the competitive landscape of live dealing.

One of the businesses that I represented, we had a couple of live dealing studios so I’m probably more au fait with the operational side of things than the technicalities of it.

### As a starting point, can you tell me about your background, how you’ve come into this space and what are your current responsibilities?

My first contact with the gaming industry was about 12 years ago when I started working for the Isle of Man Government as a consultant in the development agency which is a separate entity to the regulator but works closely alongside and it’s an inward investment program. My role was talking to the industry and encouraging businesses to locate or invest in the Isle of Man. I’m familiar with the Isle of Man ecosystem and how that all connects to the regulatory piece and the exposures for businesses in the Isle of Man in that sense and what business is palatable here and so on.

Through that, I worked with my effective CEO there; my line manager was also a consultant and we worked together for four years, had a great working relationship and team, and we decided that when the right opportunity came up, we would go and work in the private sector again because we were both private sector people. The civil service is quite challenging and very limited in its scope. That was the plan, that’s what we did and it ended up being for an Asian owner who already had huge success out in Asia in the junket market. They operated junket trips into Macau, made a lot of money doing that and then set up private dealing rooms and so forth. That was the Sun City Group; not South African Sun City but the Hong Kong based Sun City.

It was those individuals that wanted to set up something in the West. It’s a big kudos to be successful outside of Asia and that’s what they wanted to do. They weren’t particularly clear about what that looked like so that was part of the job; figure out how to make this happen. It started with a UK-facing business primarily designed to attract Asian people living in the UK because it was a very Chinese offering, that then soon developed into us operating actual Chinese-facing business from the Isle of Man under our license here.

It just grew and grew, both the amount of work that we did and what we took on here. We ended up with five gaming licenses in the UK and Isle of Man. We ended up with a couple of joint ventures, one of which was Red Tiger. We ended up opening betting shops in the UK, so it was a rollercoaster, a very steep learning experience but also got exposure to a great deal of different players in the industry, exposure to the interdependences I suppose and the difficulty of doing business in the Asian market specifically.

### You already alluded to Red Tiger and betting shops. What other types of games or bets are you familiar with?

On our B2C sites, we had sports betting and casino. We did have live dealer but primarily we used our own live dealers which were Manila based, also supplying other sites which was the Sun Group and Gold Deluxe, which don’t exist anymore because they were closed down during the first COVID outbreak. They were part of the wider group, so we used those and we also used Evolution because I’m sure, as you’re aware, it’s very incestuous as an industry and you use product from all over the place and plug as much variety in as you can and one of the key factors for Chinese players, specifically, is choice across live dealer.

On our main site, I think at our height, we possibly had six different live dealer suppliers plugged in. If they lose on one, they like to be able to move to another one. It’s all about luck in the Chinese culture and they would frequently migrate between those live dealer suppliers. If you have options available on site, you’re keeping them on site. Whereas if you’ve only got one or two choices they’ll leave to go and play somewhere else. That was the thinking. We had poker for a short time as well.

### I’m curious: who are the other live options? Playtech?

We had our own two; we had Evolution. I think one of them was called Enter Asia; it was very specific to the Chinese market. I’ve forgotten the others but they were very niche Asian suppliers.

### Setting aside the live part, were the offerings more slot games? We now have sports betting, since 2018 that has become a fast-growing area here in the US. What sort of games were you offering and what was the type of market regulations being handed out to the space? Can you talk a bit about that?

We had two distinct markets. The UK player which tends to be a split across sports and slots; and then we had our Asian market and that is very heavy live dealing. They very much trust live casino in the Asian market more than they do slot games. One of the reasons why our owners went into the joint venture with the company that ultimately ended up being Red Tiger was that they wanted to start to move the Asian player onto slots games.

So Red Tiger started to develop culturally aligned slots for that purpose, for our outlet. It’s a very different profile of player in China than it is in the UK and Europe.

### They were acquired by NetEnt, the other Swedish company which in turn was acquired by Evolution; that’s how they ended up with Red Tiger.

I was still there when the NetEnt sale went through.

### I see. Did you get to work with the NetEnt folks at all?

Not really, no. I think I had one board meeting with them, so not really familiar with those guys. What I will say is it’s useful for your background information that there was a lot of competition between NetEnt and Evolution to buy Red Tiger in the first place. I’m not sure if you’re already aware of that.

### Yes.

I would go as far as to say, looking at it now, that possibly that was a big driving force for NetEnt.

### Evolution tried a couple of times to get into slots and this was one of the avenues they were exploring. They tried something on their own as well but having acquired NetEnt now, which also includes Red Tiger, I think they’re well set. The slots piece is a little over a quarter of total revenue and that’s expected to grow.

It’s attractive business. For the European market, sports betting’s always the traditional profile of the UK player for example, but it’s not as good a business as slots where you’ve got the reliable RTP and it’s a formulaic process. You were always trying to move players over.

### From a competitive as well as regulatory landscape angle, I know the UK regulatory authority has come down and limited the number of pounds per bet or round. How has that been accepted by the playing community now? How is it likely to play out? I also see that many UK companies have now shifted their operations or at least what they call the domicile out of the UK into Malta or other regions. Can you discuss the regulatory landscape along with the competitive landscape?

The UK is a very difficult market, extremely challenging and the customer is sophisticated in the sense that they take on board what the regulator is saying publicly about gambling companies needing to up their game in a problem gambling sense and safer gambling and all those things and then uses it against the operator. It’s very, very challenging. The UK regulator is not user-friendly to operators. It’s very difficult to engage with, not supportive of the industry and I think we’re probably going to see a lot more consolidation in that market because it’s just too difficult to do business there.

It’s too difficult and too expensive. The cost of compliance is huge now and I don’t think that it necessarily is to the benefit of the customer all the time because I think what we’ll see is more black market emerging because the gambler wants to gamble. They do need to be protected but it’s not a nanny state and I think it’s going a little bit too far.

That’s another reason why the US is so attractive, because it’s a new market, a bit greener and there’s potential there to develop regulatory relationships which are a little bit more pragmatic perhaps. An acceptance that there is a tax collection to be benefited from these industries and nobody wants to rip the customer off or to send people into gambling addiction. Nobody is trying to do that, but there is a balance of responsibility which I think has gone too far in the UK and it has become very difficult to operate there.

In terms of competitive landscape, I think we’ll see these bigger operators mopping up the smaller guys, like Microgaming, Playtech, the DVCs of the world. We’re seeing a lot more from them and they’re starting to add on the more leading-edge technology. Perhaps that’s where your more smaller boutique firms will come up with esports, virtual offerings, AI and that kind of thing.

I think with the traditional products those guys have got it all wrapped up now. I think Red Tiger was probably one on its own really and got their timing right, did a very good job and I don’t think we’ll see many more of those.

### I keep going back to Evolution for a couple of reasons. It’s obviously one of the larger players in the space and, from my angle, it’s also one of my investments. The management team at Evolution keeps talking about competition coming from the larger entertainment space, not necessarily the Playtechs of the world or other players like Sun City Hong Kong. They’re referencing companies like Disney and Netflix, larger entertainment players. As a live offering company, I think it makes some sense in comparison, but coming from where you were involved at the slot end of things, does that larger entertainment space being a competitor make sense to you?

Are they seeing that from a content point of view that they’re trying to position themselves out of gambling and into entertainment?

### They’re not necessarily saying they want out of gambling. They’re just saying the larger entertainment space is going to come into gambling and they’ve seen some of that development over the last several weeks and even months. For example, Netflix has hired a big game developer out of Facebook to lead their gaming operations. Their viewpoint is what we want is eyeballs which is what entertainment offers and this is one way to keep them not only just watching but also being involved through these games, so that’s the angle.

I can see the point. I think now we’ve got the merging of online gaming and esports and those crossovers and I think that will all start to merge a little bit. We’ve got a burgeoning esports industry in the Isle of Man, for example, but not many people really understand what that means. You’ve got companies that are using esports as a betting product but you’ve then got companies that are just in esports that is a completely different and not a gambling product at all, so I can see it from that point of view.

The challenge for the entertainment companies will be that they will be tarred with the naughty gambling brush and business becomes a hell of a lot more difficult then. Go try and get in banking when you’re in gaming, even if you’ve got a tiny piece.

That is a blocker. That’s a barrier to entry for sure and I think if they do go into entertainment, there will be a different company set up to do that because they won’t be able to pollute that aspect.

### Back to your Red Tiger days, looking at the profitability metrics, your Isle of Man operations and then the Sun City overlay and the Red Tiger overlay, was there a pattern in terms of what you saw regarding profitability?

Margins are much smaller in the Asian market to than they would be in Europe. Who makes the most money in the gambling industry is usually affiliates and B2B. B2B is definitely where it’s at. We set up a B2B platform predominantly for supplying other Asian gaming operators. It wasn’t anywhere near a Playtech but it was a Playtech for Asia, basically. It doesn’t exist anymore because that was wound up as well, because the shareholders didn’t want to be in gaming anymore, but that was the most profitable piece of business that we had.

That was a platform where we plugged in product and pumped it out the other side; one of the big challenges for operators is in the integration and the bottlenecks that they have around plugging all the product in. That can be a real problem for operators to get new content out. It’s all about content.

You’ve got a casino manager screaming to get Red Tiger games integrated – it’s the best product going – but they can’t get it for 18 months because they’ve got no time to integrate it. The other thing is, you’ve got all these payment providers and all the compliance products that you also have to integrate.

The platform is really important. The speed of integration and the efficiency in the way that platform works becomes everything.

### From your angle, you’ve already referenced the US as being a very attractive feature. Any idea as to how big the US opportunity can be for operators coming in from Europe?

Not really; I would only be anecdotal. It’s a huge opportunity because you’ve got what should be a virgin market, with people wanting to gamble, and as in the UK, you’ve got something like 600, 700 casinos where you’re coming at it completely new and you’ve got that opportunity. There’s no doubt that that’s massive, but I have not really had exposure to the US potential.

### I’ve heard numbers as it relates to the live product.

I think one of the difficulties is obviously the regulatory piece because state by state regulation is a nightmare and it’s hard enough when you’re having to take different licenses for different countries because there’s always an overlap and extra things; this place wants this and this place wants that. Meeting those requirements is hugely challenging.

I’m under the impression that each state wants local hosting, as well, within the state, so you’ve got that on top. You’ve got to pick what states you’re going at. I think it’s a costly exercise.

### It’s a matter that is important for Evolution as well. Earlier this month they opened up their third studio in Michigan.

Do they have to have the live dealer studio in state, as well?

### Within their borders, yes.

Oh, my goodness.

### They currently have three studios, one in New Jersey and the other in Pennsylvania and now a third in Michigan. They’re opening up another, hopefully soon, in Connecticut. It’s an opportunity, not just from the regulatory piece, relative to many of these other locations – I don’t know about the Isle of Man labor cost – to some of these Eastern European countries, the US is going to be higher, so that’s going to impact some of the margin. We’ll have to wait and watch to see how rapidly this can grow.

They were hosting in Eastern Europe from memory when we used them.

### They still do. Malta is their primary base but they’ve got studios in Latvia and Georgia.

I’ve no idea what the appetite for this is but, at some point, surely state-by-state regulation doesn’t make any sense because that’s crazy, isn’t it? The overhead will be huge.

### {audio:0:31:31 Yes, but what I have heard is, right now, it’s a state-by-state requirement. However, over the foreseeable future, certain states will allow a studio from Michigan to broadcast its games to say, Mississippi, without necessarily having a studio within that state provided there is some sharing of those regulatory earnings. That’s the future but that’s what I’ve heard so far. How does that same market related question look for you from the Isle of Man looking at Asia?

China is a legal gambling market. The Isle of Man license is a bit different because it’s a supply-based license rather than a consumption-based license, so it’s about where the business is supplying from primarily, rather than it is about where the gambler is consuming. This is different from the UK and US licenses which seem to be consumption-based; it’s about where the customer is. Obviously, the Isle of Man wants to verify what markets you’re in and it’s comfortable with.

There isn’t that problem in Asia because there is no regulation. Consequently, that gives you different problems, particularly with payments and that’s really the key to the Chinese gambling offering. Similarly, in Japan, where quite a few of the larger operators are getting into now where the question is, how do you facilitate the payments piece? How do you get money out? How do you get people to be able to deposit funds to you? We saw that with UA going into the US as to what can potentially happen there ultimately. If you stop payments, you stop everything.

It is quite competitive but the potential is still massive there. It’s a huge market, but very competitive amongst larger players.

### From the Isle of Man, is there a specific geography that dominates?

It does tend to be a lot of Asian operators here in the Isle of Man. There is that gathering here, yes. I don’t know if you’re familiar with the football sponsorship scenario? You’ll see that a lot of the Premiership teams are sponsored by Asian-looking companies. That’s not for the purposes of marketing into the UK. That is so that they can get coverage on TV. That’s what we did and then we had a business doing that for other people as well.

So we would have a UK site. You have to have a license in the UK to be able to sponsor the team because you can’t advertise without a UK license. You have a UK license and then you divert anybody that’s coming from Asia onto a different site that’s completely designed for them.

### I see. I’ve heard both Turkey and Philippines as being two very different and very big markets. What are your views?

There are a lot of gambling operators based in Philippines but they’re not marketing to the Philippines.

### That’s what I meant. In Turkey it’s both consumers and operators.

Yes. We had our operations in Manila. That’s a bit of a political nightmare because, one day, President Duterte loves gambling, the next he wants to shoot everybody in gambling. It’s literally quite scary and I think it flip-flops around. I think he realized how much money he was going to lose and changed his mind overnight. It’s not a stable political country and one of the reasons why our live dealers don’t exist anymore is down to that.

I think a lot of them are in Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. I don’t really have any experience with Turkey particularly, no. I can’t really comment on that one I’m afraid.

### Okay, no worries. Recently Malta was put under what’s called the gray market.

On the FATF gray list, yes.

### Yes. I haven’t gone through the entire list and I’m absolutely sure Isle of Man is not on that list, but any views on that gray listing? Both Romania and Malta were put on that.

I think that it will be very damaging to the Malta gaming industry long term. I am talking to several companies in Malta about contingency in the Isle of Man because what will happen is the financial regulator will start to get concerned that their financial institutions are providing services to companies which are based in a gray-listed jurisdiction.

It’s very difficult to obtain banking services as a gaming company to start with, so if you knock off a few more because you’re in Malta, then it starts to become hugely problematic. The Isle of Man for example, I think there’s probably three banks here at the moment that will bank gaming, full stop. It’s early days so I don’t think those conversations have started but any operator worth their salt should be looking at that in my opinion. I would be.

If I was still responsible for compliance of a Malta operator, I would be looking for a backup license right now because you will not get much notice of your bank pulling out. 60, 90 days; it’s not a long time to secure alternative services. I think that will be the primary problem. Also, raising investment because the reality is that the sorts of things that are going on in Malta and that they’re not fully playing by the rules are quite well-known. They’ve pushed back and pushed back and it’s finally come back to bite them.

### What I’ve also heard is this is an annual certification. A couple of years ago, Iceland was put under the gray market when it was there for about a year and then came out. Is that a scenario that can play out in Malta?

This is only my personal opinion, but having had some dealings with Malta, it’ll probably take them more than a year to get off that list because I think there has been a reticence to adopt those international standards in the first place so, therefore, the bar is fairly low. They’ve got a lot of making up to do.

In the Isle of Man, we’ve lived through scenarios not unlike this. We’ve never been gray-listed as such, but we’ve certainly been threatened, because everyone calls us an offshore and it’s almost as if you have to be better than everywhere else to get to the same level as the other jurisdictions. I think the Isle of Man has fought very hard for that and has worked very hard at keeping up those international standards and adopting the money vow principles and so on and it’s arduous.

It is hard work. Having been part of the industry involved in doing that, I think that the Malta regulator is perhaps going to struggle with that a bit.

### Apart from having that MGA certification, which has carried a lot of weight in the past, one of the benefits is a really low tax rate, approximately 5%. I don’t know what the tax rate in the Isle of Man is. Is that comparable for companies moving out of Malta to have a backup plan in the Isle of Man? Will that be an added burden?

For the gaming tax specifically, yes, it’s lower. It’s up to 1.5%. I think that Malta has benefited from its good weather in its gaming industry, because it’s like a magnet and this is what’s happened in the Isle of Man with the Asia businesses. You get one or two and then it just brings a whole raft of others. It magnetizes people. Everyone says, “Oh, you have to be in the Isle of Man if you’re Asian.” There’s no particular reason for that. Really it’s just that people get it; people understand that business and therefore it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, doesn’t it?

Malta has developed a burgeoning gaming industry because people like living in Malta and they like the weather but I think it’s gone too far the other way. Maybe now it’s a bit too full. People are complaining it’s too crowded now. It has offered a very supportive base for gambling companies in the EU. It kind of moves round these jurisdictions; it’s a bit cyclical. Gibraltar has had its day; Malta has had its day. I think the Isle of Man is probably quite well positioned at the moment but I’m sure it’ll flip somewhere else again.

### Evolution has a Malta-based operation and so they’re able to benefit from the MGA stamp as well as, primarily, the taxes. They haven’t responded clearly about what may happen in the future. From an investor standpoint, you’ve been on the regulatory side and on the investing side as well. Regarding the larger landscape, be it live sports betting or the entire slot gaming market, is there anything else that you think can be a hindrance or an obstacle? To give you some background, Germany said they’re going to evaluate the live offering and I found out earlier that live in Germany is now completely shut down. For Evolution, it was an important enough but not dominant market, yet it’s now gone. With that as the backdrop, anything else as a regulator or investor that jumps out as a potential threat to the larger landscape?

I jotted down a few things before the call. We’ve talked about the compliance piece and that the complexities of the requirements in different jurisdictions are a challenge. They need to be kept on top of and that whole responsible gambling piece is really important. I think, as a B2B provider, there’s more and more impetus for them to take responsibility because, historically, there’s been a tendency for B2B suppliers to be very hands off with that piece. There’s definitely a shift there where there is an expectation from regulators that, actually, games providers are taking this on as a responsibility themselves as well. It’s probably an opportunity as well as a risk.

Something that I see in the slots’ world is that there’s very little differentiation of product and I think that’s why Red Tiger was successful. They managed to develop very intuitive, enjoyable and addictive games at the end of the day and that’s why they were very successful and everybody wanted them. It’s how you do that and keep that and how you stay that one step ahead because you can end up with a whole lot of content that’s all much of a muchness. At a certain level, you lose any differentiation. It’s not about quantity, it’s about quality.

Having been on the ground and visited live dealers and worked with them on satisfying the regulatory requirements for the actual live dealer operations, that’s quite challenging. I imagine it’s not as challenging in the US as it was for us in Manila where we were dealing with a culture which didn’t really understand what compliance was. I’m sure Evolution are very well equipped to deal with that.

My comments are more about opportunities than they are about dangers. The big data piece is thrown around a lot but, in my experience, gaming companies don’t use their data anywhere near as much as they should do. They have all this data on gameplay; they have all the statistics and they just don’t use it to make decisions. I guess that’s an opportunity more than it is a risk but somebody potentially coming in that does do that better as a platform provider and provides that analysis already is a potential competitive threat.

### That’s a very interesting point. I’m going off-script. Have you heard of a company called Kambi? To your point about using data, I’m curious as to Kambi satisfy your question there appropriately?

I’m not familiar enough with them to know the answer to that but, from personal experience, it never ceases to amaze me, when you are in a technology driven business with all this data that’s available to you, how little it was used.

### Kambi is essentially the background creator for these sports betting companies. When you walk into a sports betting shop in London and place a bet on the recently concluded Euros as it was going on, there’s some sort of line play and how do they come up with that? One of the ways they do it is through Kambi. They use a lot of data to facilitate that process, placing a bet, coming up with a line and moving the line based on data that comes in. Maybe one of the players on one of the teams is hurt so the line will move accordingly. Since you brought up the data point, I thought that was interesting.

### Back to the competition part; that’s the angle I want to continue to explore. As these UK companies have moved down to Malta and Malta is now going through this process, maybe they’re all moving out of Malta into Isle of Man or somewhere else, how is this likely to shake out? From the live side, I’ve heard Asia Gaming out of Asia is a big competitor, Playtech out of the UK are offering live. In this the shakeout that you are describing; Gibraltar, moving to Malta, to Isle of Man to somewhere else? Do you anticipate any major shakeout or do you think somebody like an Evolution will be able to continue to dominate the space like they’re doing today?

I think a lot of it comes down to how they use those acquisitions that they’ve made. When I first came across them, they were quite a disorganized, ramshackle unit and now they’re this huge business that own NetEnt and I think it comes down to whether they can effectively use those assets properly and organize themselves. These businesses get to that stage and then you often see with a merger or a buyout that they end up being worth less than they would’ve been if they were separate because they’ve destroyed the value.

I think the risk with this is that it’s just a case of mopping up stuff. Well, what are you going to do with it? There’s always a risk, particularly from Asians with the live dealer piece, because that’s what they know and they’re damn good at it. Asia Gaming have grown really quickly because Asia Gaming have probably only really been around something like six years. They’ve grown really quickly and I don’t really know how streamlined the outfit is but there’s always a risk of someone coming along that’s more fleet of foot and better organized. I think that’s the danger for someone the size of Evolution.

### Did you use Asia Gaming’s offerings as well?

We did use Asia Gaming, yes. BBIN was the other one.

### Quality-wise, did you see any sort of difference between what Evolution was offering versus Asia Gaming?

At the time, Evolution were quite poor, but that was a good few years ago now.

### Three, four, five years or longer?

Probably four years ago, I’d say. I would’ve thought that their product has come on quite a long way since then. Asia Gaming were very good actually; one of the better ones.

### In what sense? Is it the quality of the dealers, quality of resolution of games or the quality of the outcomes? In what sense were you finding that difference?

The design of the interface, the delivery, how it looked to the player, the player experience really and the resilience.

### Have you seen the upgraded version of Evolution recently and compared it to Asia Gaming?

No, not recently. From personal experience what I would say is that the Asian providers are very unsophisticated in their corporate organization. It’s all friends and family and you’ve got people who are VP of god knows what who perhaps haven’t got the skills to really do that job. I think Asia Gaming has probably grown up quite a lot in the last couple of years but they started out like that. It’s more luck than judgment.

### That’s an interesting statement. I would be curious if you get a chance to look at some of the recent offerings from Evolution and compare it to your own experience from four, five years ago. Based on what I’m seeing, there’s more and more operators coming to Evolution. Asia Gaming is still private and so I’m not able to compare the growth on one side versus the other.

Certainly, in my experience, there was room for the live dealing product to be developed a lot further in terms of what they were providing. It was a very Asian product, starting out. I think that’s where Evolution probably did well because they came at it from a European standpoint which didn’t really exist. No-one else was really doing that.

### We’ve gone full circle, in terms of geography, various products and you’ve been thoughtful in your responses with respect to questions about competition and regulatory changes. There are so many areas that I can go to that you can answer but based on what you have heard from me – I’m coming at this from a public market investor; I don’t invest in private companies like Asia Gaming or other players – is there anything else you would like to shed some light on that might be helpful?

Some of the questions I’ve been asked previously were very focused on the value that was in Red Tiger because that’s where my experience was and how that could have added to the portfolio in Evolution. My overall comment on that would be that I think a lot of the value in that business was in the people that started it, the owner and the particular strategy that they had to attack the market. Being subsumed by the larger NetEnt and then Evolution, there’s a danger to the value in that app. It was a very boutique creator studio and I don’t actually know how many of the original people were still connected and how long for.

I would be dubious as to whether they fulfil the real value of that business because part of the appeal of it was that it was fleet of foot and they just got on with it and did it. I think that becomes quite difficult when you’re part of a much larger engine. I think there’s a danger in people valuing that piece with too much regarding Red Tiger. It has to be fundamentally about what Evolution’s core business is.

### They have, in fact, gone ahead and made another acquisition this year with a company called Big Time Gaming. That just closed.

My view is do what you’re good at and stick at what you’re good at because then you start to lose focus, don’t you and everything starts to be spread a bit too thinly and you’re not good at anything anymore.

### That’s always the danger. Let’s see how things integrate. NetEnt closed only in November last year. That is now fully integrated. Big Time Gaming closed recently so hopefully we’ll have more color by the end of this year when they report.

It’s the same as everything, isn’t it? Having that clear strategy and knowing how you’re going to meet it.

### Thanks for taking the time and shedding light on the Isle of Man angle. I’m always curious to learn more about this space. It’s growing at breakneck speed and there are so many changes happening.

I don’t know if you’ve heard of a company called Luckbox, a company just listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange based in the Isle of Man which is esports.

### I’ve heard of it, but I haven’t done any work on it.

They seem to be going places.

### I’ll take a look at that. I appreciate your time.
