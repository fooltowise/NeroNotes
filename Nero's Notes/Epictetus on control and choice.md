# Epictetus on Control And Choice

#stoicism

> The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can clearly say to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own.


Ultimately the only thing that I have control on are my choices and my reactions. My focus should therefore be concentrated on my choices, and not on things I cannot control.

I can influence the future through the power I have right now, by making the right choices.
