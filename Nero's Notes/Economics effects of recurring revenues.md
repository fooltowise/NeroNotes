In most [[Recurring Revenues]] models, customers fund a provider's business: customers pay ahead of delivery of goods or services. Many such companies can operate with negative [[Costs of Working Capital]], meaning fewer resources are tied up to operations, which translates into lower costs and higher profits. Indeed, for most other companies, growth in size induces greater cost of working capital; for those enjoying recurring revenues, growth can instead drive greater benefits from working capital.

Subscription and service revenues tend to be billed in advance. Revenue therefore turns into cash more quickly than for companies that bill and collect only after goods are delivered or services rendered. Cash is always more valuable the earlier it is received.

Subscription and service revenue tends to require little capital investment to support growth. At one extreme, software companies update product files at the flip of a switch; even manufacturing companies typically produce spare parts using machinery and equipment already in operation. Specific service activity is also asset-light - usually personnel and a simple set of tools.

**The combination of potentially negative working capital, rapid cash flows, and low capital expenditure to support growth is rare in business - but is a common feature of the recurring revenue model.**
