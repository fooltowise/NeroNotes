# Artificially boosting revenues and earnings

### Inflating profits through tricks at a target company before a deal close
- Watch for a slowdown in revenue at the target prior to the acquisition close
- Watch for unusual sources of revenue at the time of the acquisition. For instance, boomerang transactions between a franchisor and its franchisee.

### Inflating profits by hiding losses at deal closing
- Ex: Olympus  bought many companies an paid far more than they were worth to dissimulate operating losses. Then it labeled the reported loss as a fee to a middle-man related to the acquisition deals, in order to flush the operating losses away.

###  Creating dubious new revenue streams after closing
- Ex: Inflated price of acquisition before closing provided that the acquiree will pay a licensing fee the year after.
- Watch for either a buyer or seller creating an unrelated nonrecurring revenue stream.
- Question the management of the acquirer when changing accounting practice of a target inflates profits.

### Inflating profits by releasing suspicious reserves either before or just after closing
- Watch for big gains from reduction of contingent consideration liabilities.
