# Why Women Are Looking at Men's Personality

Personality is critical in men. In a monogamous society a woman is often choosing a mate long before he has had a chance to become a 'chief' and she must look for clues to his future potential rather than rely only on his past achievements.

Poise, self-assurance, optimism, efficiency, perseverance, courage, decisiveness, intelligence, ambition - these are the things that cause men to rise to the tops of their professions and, not coincidentally, these are things women find attractive.

They are clues to future status. 

If women select mates on the basis of personality more than men do, this correlates with the fact well-known to many couples, that women are better judges of character. Good female judges of character left more descendants than bad. Good male judges did not better than bad male judges.
