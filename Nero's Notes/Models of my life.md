### On economics and empirical results

> In empirical science the final test is not mathematical elegance or *a priori* plausability, but the match between theory and data. I certainly learned that lesson somewhere, ultimately overcoming my innate Platonism and armoring myself against the aesthetic lures of neoclassical economics, so responsive to mathematical elegance and so indifferent to data.


### On teaching

> Those mature and demanding co-op students, and the even more mature and demanding GIs who appeared after the war, taught me a great deal about teaching. I learned that there is no use lecturing to a class unless the class is listening. And they will only listen if you are saying something that they think they can understand and that seems relevant. They will listen better if you talk LOUDLY. If you pace up and down, you can tell from their moving heads whether they are following you (like the crowd at a tennis match). You can also get feedback by keeping your eye on the prettiest girl in the class to see whether she is attentive. (Unfortunately, at that time engineering classes did not have female students.)

> If the students are engineers, they will better understand the logic of a Supreme Court case if you can represent it on the blackboard as a wiring diagram for an electric circuit, the switches representing the yes-or-no choices of the court. The wiring diagram for the case of Marbury v. Madison, in which the Supreme Court for the first time declared an act of congress unconstitutional, being rather baroque, pleased the students no end. Teaching is not entertainment, but it is unlikely to be successful unless it is entertaining (the more respectable word would be interesting).

> Coverage of subject matter is a snare and a delusion. You begin where the students are prepared to begin; and you carry them as far as you can without losing them. Whether that takes you to the end of the specified curriculum, half as far, or twice as far, is irrelevant. You talk from notes, and certainly do not read lectures - in fact, it is better if you do not write them out. Anything you cannot communicate without reading will be forgotten instantly, and probably is not suitable for a lecture anyway.

> You prepare notes for more material than you can possibly cover so that you don't suffer from the beginning teacher's nightmare: What happens if I run out of material before the end of class? If you do, which almost never happens, you dismiss the class. They will thank you for it. There is zero correlation between the number of hours you put in preparing formally for your classes and their success, provided that you have a coherent general outline of the curriculum and a thorough knowledge of the subject.

> You start every class by giving students the opportunity (or better, the obligation) to ask questions about their reading, about previous sessions, or about anything. You take each question seriously, and answer it without making a jackass of the student who asked it (no matter how foolish the question). After a year of teaching constitutional law, I found I was able to write a twenty-page document to distribute to students that provided answers to 90% of the questions they asked. I was never sure whether that was a good thing, though, for it cut down the questioning.

>Of course, students don't learn by being lectured at, anyway; they learn by thinking hard, solving problems, dissecting proofs. Requiring them to write briefs was the most important component of our teaching at IIT. After students have thought hard about a topic, a lecture can help them sort out and organize their thoughts. Enlightements, like accidents, happen only to prepared minds. If students have thought about something, you can discuss it profitably in class. Without the preparation, it is just a bull session.

> You keep lectures on the high ground. The details of proofs are better gleaned from books. Above all, you feel no obligation to repeat the contents of the textbook, for that would simply confirm students into the habit of not reading it.

### On architects
> Architects are notoriously prone to design buildings that are bid at 40% over the agreed budget. And they are notoriously inept with such prosaic details as air-conditioning, energy efficiency, waterproof roofs, and all manner of other things their clients and the inhabitants of their buildings consider important. 


> A society as affluent as ours can afford to provide painters with just about all the canvas and paint they can use, and let them paint what they want. But no society is affluent enough to provide its architects with all the steel and glass and concrete they need to save their artistic souls. Nor should the members of a democratic society be obliged to delegate to the architectural profession the decisions that determine the comfort and pleasantness of their daily surroundings. Architects have every right to try to educate public taste, but not to dictate it, or to intimidate their lay clients, diffident and embarrassed by their ignorance of the arts.


### On decision making
> Fitness is the central concept in modern Darwinian genetics. It is measured simply by the rate at which an organism reproduces itself. If two organisms compete for occupancy of the same ecological niche, relative fitness determines which will survive. Even small differences in fitness can lead to enormous differences in reproductive success over only a few generations. 


> Replace competition between two populations by choice between two alternatives, an replace fitness by any measure associated with the outcomes of the choices. Then if one is confronted repeatedly with choices of some kind(for example, whether to take a second helping), slight differences in the probability of selecting one alternative or another can soon produce substantial differences in outcome (body weight). All of us are familiar with this particular example.

> The win or loss of a chess game may be decided in the same incremental way. Especially when good players are nearly equal in skill, the game is seldom lost by a single bad move.  Rather,  the winning player secures a cumulative advantage by exploiting successful small weaknesses that are observed  in the opponent's choices of moves. We can express the better player's advantage by a probability, slightly greater than 0.5, that in each pair of moves that player's will be the stronger.

> For most of us - those of us who have not won million-dollar lotteries, or suffered sudden crippling accidents - life is much like the chess game. We make hundreds of choices among the alternative paths that lie before us and, as the result of those choices, find ourselves pursuing particular, perhaps highly specialized, careers, married to particular spouses, and living in particular towns. Even if we point a single event as the "cause" of one of these outcomes, closer scrutiny of the path we have trod would reveal prefatory or preparatory events and choices that made the occurrence of the critical event possible.


### On Authority

> At first I did not recognize that when you are in a position of authority you cannot debate freely with people in your organization without some of them believing that they may endanger their careers if they disagree with you too vigorously. Perhaps they are right - I like to think not in my case, but self-deception is easy. People who agree with you are apt to seem a little more intelligent than those who don't. Power does corrupt. See [[Bias from Authority]].

### On Salesmen

> My father had carefully told me "Never sign in the presence of the salesman", and I had learned that valuable lesson well, to the point of reflexive response.

### On mental models

> One can train a man so that he has at his disposal a list or repertoire of the possible actions that could be taken under the circumstances... a person who is new at the game does not have immediately at his disposal a set of possible actions to consider, but has to construct them on the spot, a time-consuming and difficult mental task. The decision maker of experience has at his disposal a checklist of things to watch out for before finally accepting a decision...

> A large part of the difference between the experienced decision maker and the novice in these situations is not any particular intangible like "judgment" or "intuition". If one could open the lid, so to speak, and see what was in the head of the experienced decision maker, one would find that he had at his disposal repertoires of possible actions; that he had checklists of things to think about before he acted; and that he had mechanisms in his mind to evoke these, and bring these to his conscious attention when the situations for decision arose. Most of what we do to get people ready to act in situations of encounter consists in drilling these lists into them sufficiently deeply so that they will be evoked quickly at the time of the decision.


### On his Philosophy of life
> I am an adaptive system, whose survival and success, whatever my goals, depend on maintaining a reasonably veridical picture of my environment of things and people. Since my world picture approximates reality only crudely, I cannot aspire to optimize anything; at most, I can aim at [[Satisficing]]. Searching for the best can only dissipate scarce cognitive resources; the best is the enemy of the good.

> How do you put duty in a utility function? For a satisficing theory it's quite easy: Simply place it among the constraints. Of course, we may also view duty as a cost we pay for society's willingness to cooperate with us. This implies that every person has a price. Possibly so, but i prefer the satisficing view.

> What duties would I impose? Starting at the weak end of the spectrum, there is general acceptance of the duty not to harm others - the negative version of the Golden Rule. A higher, and not unreasonable, standard is the obligation to leave the world no worse off than it would have been without us. Since most people, even people in rather humble circumstances, can meet that requirement, perhaps it is proper to insist on it.

> A still heavier obligation, not always acknowledged, is to leave to future generations as wide and interesting  a range of options as our generation inherited from our forebears. To do so, we must accept collective responsibility for securing sustainable energy sources, preserving the environment, stabilizing world population, and somehow removing or dulling the threat of the Bomb. We have no obligation to solve all the World's problems (there is no prospect that we could); we do have an obligation to avert irreversible catastrophe and to oppose implacably every step toward  it.
