Here are the guidelines to create your three five-years [[Odyssey Plans]]. Each one must include:
1. A visual/graphical timeline. Include personal and non-career events as well. Do you want to be married, train to win the Crossfit games, or learn how to bend spoons with your mind?
2. A title for each option in the form of a six-word headline describing the essence of this alternative.
3. Questions that this alternative is asking - preferably two or three. A good designer asks questions to test assumptions and reveal new insights. In each potential timeline, you will investigate different possibilities and learn different things about yourself and the world. What kinds of things will you want to test and explore in each alternative version of your life?
4. A dashboard where you can gauge:
	1. Resources (do you have the objective resources - time, money, skill, contacts - you need to pull off your plan?)
	2. Likability - Are you hot or cold or warn about your plan?
	3. Confidence (Are you feeling full of confidence, or pretty uncertain about pulling this off?)
	4. Coherence - Does the plan make sense within itself? And is it consistent with you, your [[Workview Reflection]] and your [[Lifeview Reflection]]?


Possible reflections:
- Geography - where will you live?
- What experience/learning will you gain?
- What are the impacts and results of choosing this alternative?
- What will life look like? What particular role, industry, or company do you see yourself in?


Other ideas: 
- Do keep in mind things other than career and money. Even though those things are important, if not central, to the decisive direction of your next few years, there are other critical elements that you want to pay attention to.
- Any of the considerations listed above can be a springboard for forming your alternative  lives for the next five years. If you find yourself stuck, try making a mind map out of any of the design considerations listed above. Don't overthink this exercise, and don't skip it.
