The modern world provides us with a daily increasing flow of information. In this context, it can be hard to filter correctly useful information from the rest. Fortunately, when faced with new information about a business I am invested in, I should only ask a few question to gauge its relevance:

1. In light of this information, has the unit economics of the business improved or worsened?
	1. Does any of that makes a meaningful difference to the relationship our business has with its customers? This bond(or not!) between customers and companies is one of the most important factors for determining long-term business success.

		For example, what investors needed to understand, and attribute sufficient weight to, in order to hold Colgate-Palmolive shares for the last thirty years, and so enjoy the fifty-fold uplift in share price, was the economics of incremental products (often referred to as “line extensions”, from the first “Winterfresh” blue minty gel in 1981 to “Total Advanced Whitening” today) and the psychology of advertising. Other items were important too, discipline in capital spending in particular, and there were lots of other things that seemed important along the way (stock market crises, country crises, management crises and so on) but it was the success and economics of line extensions and advertising that, in our opinion, was what the long-term investor really needed to embrace. A similar story can be told at Nike and Coca-Cola (manufacturing savings funneled into dominant advertising) or Wal-Mart and Costco (scale savings shared with the customer). Recognizing and correctly weighing this information in-spite of the latest news flow is a matter of discipline, and it is that discipline that is so richly rewarded in the end.


2. Does this tell me something about the quality of the management? Its capital allocation skills?
