# [[Visa]], [[Mastercard]] - Expanding the rails, part 2

by [[Scuttleblurb]]


**Related Post: [\[V – Visa; MA – Mastercard\] Expanding the Rails, Part 1](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/visa-v-mastercard-ma-expanding-the-rails/)** The most enduring companies, as the old bit goes, obsess over timeless universals: “paying for stuff should be easy, fast, and safe”.  Sizing a market helps to scope the problem that a product is meant to attack, but fixating on any given market or product can be a bad idea because the surrounding context is always shifting.  Consider how the payments landscape has changed over the last few decades.  Acceptance points have morphed from knuckle busters to landline-linked terminals to QR codes; payment instruments have evolved from plastic cards nestled in leather wallets to online buttons embedded in online checkout sites, digital wallets downloaded on smartphones, contactless cards embedded with microchips.  PayPal, Braintree, Stripe, Square, Adyan, and other online-native and API-interfacing facilitators have created impressive value as intermediating layers.  While V/MA’s moatiness is often taken for granted, it’s not too difficult to imagine how these two could have circumscribed their opportunity set by product or geography or obstinately closed their networks to stave off ostensible competition.  Instead, both companies recognize that how we pay for stuff conforms to the broader contours of how we interact with the world, and have adapted their networks to that reality.

At the heart of both companies’ competitive advantages lies the resolution of a coordination problem.  From _Expanding the Rails, Part 1_:

_“If you wanted to build your own payments network to compete with Visa, you’d need to win over the issuing banks.  Of course, you won’t get the issuers if you don’t have merchants to accept your card and you won’t get the merchants unless you have the issuers’ card customers, who want to know that the card is accepted nearly everywhere…and, critically, you won’t get anyone unless you can ensure security, which itself depends on the insights garnered from the 100bn+ of transactions these two networks process every year.  Every time you swipe your card, Visa evaluates over 500 different data points to determine fraud risk, calculates a risk score, and sends that score to the issuer to approve the transaction.all in a fraction of a second.  Clearly, this is a tough chicken/egg nut to crack.”_

The feedback dynamic between issuers, merchants, and consumers is ensconced within several big trends.  First, cash still makes up nearly half of relevant global Personal Consumption Expenditures (excluding Russia and China) but is losing ground to electronic payment methods due in meaningful part to e-commerce sales growing 4x-5x faster than in-store transactions.  If we assume ~4%-5% global PCE growth, add to it 3 to 5 points to account for the shift to electronic payments, and another 2 to 3 points for share gains, we arrive at what seems a reasonable hsd/ldd base case payments volume growth going forward, in line with what we’ve seen for both companies over the last 5-6 years(1).

Second, potential acceptance points are nowhere near saturated.  Electronic payments are no longer mediated by expensive point-of-sale terminals, but can be enabled by scanning lightweight QR code printouts, reducing the cost of electronic payments acceptance for vast swaths of financially constrained micro merchants in sparsely populated regions with remedial telecom infrastructure.  QR codes, while still uncommon in the US – where plastic payment cards preceded smartphones – are ubiquitous in Asia, where the maturity of electronic payments has coincided with smartphone adoption.  Acceptance points in India have more than doubled over the last year to 3mn-4mn, thanks partly to the late 2016 launch of BharatQR, a universal QR standard developed by the Indian government in partnership with several payment networks, including Visa and Mastercard, as part of an aggressive “demonetization” initiative designed to spur electronic payment adoption.  There are nearly 60mn small/micro merchants and [300mn smartphone users](https://www.statista.com/statistics/467163/forecast-of-smartphone-users-in-india/) in India.  Nearly 95% of retail transactions in India are still consummated with cash.  The opportunity for digital payments is massive and the conditions for doing so – growing smartphone penetration, cost effective point-of-sale setup, concerted efforts by the government to combat cash – are ever ripening. 

But the proliferation of acceptance points is not just limited to mobile first emerging markets.  Even in a mature market like the US, Mastercard has grown acceptance by 11%/year over the last 5 years, hitting an inflection point at around 2012 as on-premise commerce ecosystems like Square and API interfacing solutions like Stripe and Braintree found traction and extended Mastercard’s rails to a long tail of small merchants (including myself).  And we can all idly speculate about when connected cars, refrigerators, and various other IoT trinkets function as payment acceptance devices. The main point is that regardless of the interface, Mastercard and Visa will own the underlying payments plumbing and tax the volume running through it. 

In that spirit, they have been opening up more and more of their APIs over the last 6-7 years – Mastercard doubled the number of APIs available to developers in 2017 across data, security, and payments functions and will double it again this year – allowing social networks, banks, and payment facilitators to plug into their pipes.  And even while facilitators like PayPal, Square, Stripe, Apple Pay, etc. have burrowed their way into the payment stack, there has been no discernible impact on Visa or Mastercard’s yields _\[net revenue divided into global purchase volumes\]_, which have held steady for Visa (after normalizing for Visa Europe) over the last 5 years, and have inched higher for Mastercard, even after stripping out the latter’s fast growing services revenue _and_ including lower yielding volumes from the May 2017 Vocalink acquisition.  This should not be all that surprising given the market power that V/MA wield as indispensable and ubiquitous infrastructure providers.  New intermediators will take their ~7/8bps out of interchange and, as has been the case with Durbin interchange caps, banks will simply pass the hit onto consumers.

Let’s wade into some murkier waters, starting with Europe. Nearly 3 years after the European Parliament adopted it, the Payment Services Directive part Deux (PSD2) is going into effect this year.  The regulation requires banks to expose APIs that grant external non-bank financial service providers access to customer accounts, allowing those providers to build on top of banks’ data and infrastructure.  Third parties, by wedging themselves between banks and their customers and leveraging direct consumer relationships to modularize and re-bundle services that were once tightly controlled by banks, can consolidate accounts from different financial institutions into a single record or provide a menu of financial services.  Treefin, for instance, is a German app launched in 2015 that analyzes insurance, banking, and investment accounts and recommends ways to improve your personal finances; figo (also German) sees itself as one day providing an [“app store” of financial services](https://www.strategyand.pwc.com/media/file/Catalyst-or-threat.pdf) from different banks. 

You can see why the latter are so freaked out by this legislation.  Now, it’s also true that the regulation gives banks the ability to extend services to new markets and customers, but those benefits are equally available to all banks and, in my opinion, far outweighed by the the deleterious impact of exposing their bundles to disaggregation and losing the point of customer contact. The legislation also potentially poses some risk to Visa and Mastercard.  Notably, Deutsche Bank recently announced a pilot project with the International Air Transport Association (IATA), whereby Deutsche will intermediate payments between travelers and IATA’s member airlines, cutting out credit and debit rails, and presumably saving IATA members [$8bn in costs from payment processing and fraudulent activity](https://www.db.com/newsroom_news/2018/deutsche-bank-pilots-game-changing-payments-solution-with-iata-en-11574.htm).  We’ll just have to see how far this goes, but for the time being, I see PSD2 as a neutral-to-positive for Visa and Mastercard.  It presents them with a wide array of services opportunity – from dual factor authentication to analytics to real time payments – as banks are forced to step up their game in the face of new competition.  And I have a hard time seeing new fintech start-ups shifting the balance of power away from V/MA.  Even with permissioned access to bank accounts and infrastructure, any payments intermediary must still spin up an ecosystem of consumers and merchants, which in turn requires a strong brand, impregnable security, and a frictionless user experience.  While the relative share of V/MA, wallets, direct debit, and local card schemes in e-commerce transactions varies by country, PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard are (according to [Dataprovider](https://ecommercenews.eu/top-3-payment-methods-per-european-country/)) really the dominant three payment methods _\[The Netherlands, where inter-bank transfer system iDeal has 80% share, is a rare exception\]._ 

PSD2 or no, a new payments player in most European countries will have to draw the volumes necessary to justify the substantial marketing and technology investments required to compete directly against these entrenched payment methods.  Far more likely is the scenario that is playing out in the US, where customer-facing payments applications simply access V/MA’s rails and commit themselves to the consumer experience.  So, for now, I think Visa and Mastercard gain from both nimble fintech upstarts extending the reach of card rails and from sclerotic banks beckoning for assistance.  Visa has a particularly bright future in Europe, with higher yields to come as it steers Visa Europe from a sleepy member-owned association to a profit-oriented commercial entity pursuing more profitable credit volumes (vs. lower yielding debit), cross-selling value-added products to issuers and implementing price hikes (as a standalone entity, Visa Europe realized net revenue yields of just 9bps vs. Visa’s mid-20s yield).

Compared to Europe, payments in India is a highly competitive land grab with multiple players up and down the stack attempting to coordinate ecosystem constituents and establish standards.  It’s far from obvious that Mastercard and/or Visa will create the deepest value pools here and whatever volumes they do win will likely come at far lower yields than they currently realize in their established markets: in mobile first societies like China, India, and other parts of Asia, the critical point of leverage is further up the payment stack, concentrated in omnipresent and heavily engaged mobile apps with rich communications and merchant ecosystems like WeChat, Alipay, and Paytm. Alibaba and Softbank-backed Paytm has 90% mobile wallet share and [320mn users](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/features/how-vijay-shekhar-sharma-is-bracing-for-his-biggest-battle/articleshow/63351682.cms) compared to just 30mn credit/70mn debit cards used in point of sale transactions.  The 1bn transactions processed by its platform every quarter is comparable to the [total number of quarterly transactions across credit and debit cards](https://www.medianama.com/2017/07/223-india-credit-cards-debit-cards-may-2017/).  While it recently adopted the open BharatQR standard, Paytm is still running its own, much more popular proprietary QR system, whose [7mn offline merchant acceptance points](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/features/how-vijay-shekhar-sharma-is-bracing-for-his-biggest-battle/articleshow/63351682.cms) is double the 450k BharatQR-enabled merchants and 3mn POS terminals combined.  Also, this past June, it was rumored that Paytm would be rolling out its own physical PoS terminals.  WhatsApp, with 230mn monthly active users in India, is also getting after payments, riding the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), a system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (or NPCI, a non-profit organization owned by a consortium of mostly government owned Indian banks), to enable real time fund transfers between bank accounts (Paytm already accounts for 40% of UPI transactions in India).  So are Google and Amazon.  Moreover, at the scheme-level, NPCI-backed RuPay, a competing domestic network launched in 2012, has broken Visa and Mastercard’s longstanding duopoly, though I’ve seen market share expressed in different ways…[last year, NPCI’s CEO announced that RuPay had overtaken as Visa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_teP4aLeX0) by credit and debit _cards_ outstanding (43% share…notably, Paytm recently launched a digital debit card that runs on Rupay’s rails), while Visa recently averred that it was the market leader, accumulating over 50% share (of payment flow, presumably) over the 37 years that it’s been operating in India. Whatever the case, RuPay was a non-entity just 5 years ago and its progress since then has proven ominous enough to prompt Visa to complain that the Indian government is backing Rupay as part of an “invisible mandate”.  But with 90%+ of transactions consummated with cash, India is still for the most part untrammeled terrain that can for some time accommodate the growth ambitions of multiple players, and to be clear, Visa and Mastercard have been doing just fine there, each growing payment volumes by ~20%-30% y/y. 

Also, as in the US, fierce competition doesn’t foreclose the possibility of partnerships, and with various fintech entities (including Paytm) recently licensed as “payment banks” – meaning they accept deposits and issue debit/ATM cards but can’t issue credit – we may, I speculate, see some kind of arrangement whereby V/MA credit cards are made more easily accessible to Paytm users as a wallet funding option and perhaps, in turn, credit issuing banks offer a rebate on the interchange that they receive from Paytm (or something). 

_\[Last year, Paytm blocked some of its users from funding their wallets using credit cards under the pretext that some bad actors were funding their wallets with credit cards and then transferring those funds back into their bank accounts to earn points or [gain access to free credit](https://blog.paytm.com/unable-to-add-money-to-wallet-with-your-credit-card-know-why-cf69f452d2ff).  In response, Paytm passed along a 2% charge to credit card funders, a measure that was quietly suspended after inciting user uproar.\]._  

China has attracted lots of attention thanks to the stunning dominance of Ant Financial and WeChat, who are disintermediating local banks and diverting ever more traffic away from the country’s domestic credit and debit monopoly, China UnionPay (CUP).  The two entities’ ~$14tn+ of payment flows(2) rival [CUP’s $15tn](http://www.unionpayintl.com/en/mediaCenter/newsCenter/companyNews/3533.shtml) and V/MA’s combined $17tn (including cash volumes).  Visa and Mastercard, as you recall, are still locked out of China’s domestic payments market, but potentially compete with Ant and WeChat in: 1/ cross-border flows (i.e. Chinese tourist spending in the US).  While neither Mastercard nor Visa explicitly disclose outbound volume from China, we know that cross-border revenue accounts for ~25% of total gross revenue across Visa and Mastercard, and Chinese outbound volume is very likely less than 20% of that, so we’re talking less than 5% of payment flows in the grand scheme of things.  Also, cross-border payment volumes have accelerated across both Visa and Mastercard over the last year; and 2/ established markets.  Alipay claims that its ambitions in the US are limited to helping Chinese travelers transact, but even if this were not the case, there’s just no way that our government would allow a Chinese entity to assume anywhere close to a dominant role in America’s payments infrastructure, as evidenced by its blocking of MoneyGram’s acquisition by Ant.  (Of course, none of this precludes a US-based company from trying to replicate the sprawling digital economies that Tencent and Alibaba have fostered in China). 

Furthermore, payments network effects are mostly local phenomena that give rise to local champions like PayPal in the US, Ant/WeChat in China, Paytm in India, and PagSeguro in Brazil.  There’s no reason to believe that Ant or WeChat, which benefited from favorable conditions unique to China, are primed for comparable success in markets dominated by established incumbents. In the US, the balance of power is not as heavily tilted towards intermediators as it is in Asia, and the Choice partnership between PayPal and V/MA – which extends PayPal’s reach into offline channels and renders V/MA more easily accessible online through PayPal’s wallet – ostensibly pairs the two in happy partnership.  But at the same time, given PayPal’s deepening relationships with merchants _and_ consumers, whose transactions are shifting irreversibly to the e/m-commerce channels where PayPal reigns, it would be naive of Visa and Mastercard not to stand at attention.  Of course, we don’t need to conjure farcically extreme scenarios.  The risk is not that Visa and Mastercard are obviated out of existence but rather than they become increasingly modularized as one of several possible rails on a payment page or within a single powerful PayPal wallet.  To defend against such an outcome and bolster independent online relevance, Visa and Mastercard have tried launching their own branded wallets, Visa Checkout and Masterpass, both of which have proven to be duds.

_\[The Mastercard and Visa numbers are a bit stale as both companies ceased disclosures.  Mastercard discloses that it has 90mn “accounts enabled” for Masterpass, but this is the same thing as “accounts enrolled”\]_ According to [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-20/shiny-new-button-may-help-visa-mastercard-and-amex-fight-paypal): _“About 58 percent of merchants surveyed last year said they already accept PayPal with more saying they plan to do so this year, according to a study that was partially funded by PayPal. Visa Checkout and Masterpass were accepted by 26 percent and 16 percent of the merchants, respectively.”_

![](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/v_ma_2.png)

And per [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/visa-mastercard-talk-about-cooperating-in-online-shopping-1524082940): _“About 64% of consumers used PayPal to make online or mobile payments at least once in the past year, compared to 22% for Visa Checkout and 8% for Masterpass, according to a 2018 survey from Bernstein Research.”_ To be absolutely clear, e-commerce penetration is a good thing for Mastercard and Visa.  Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal are all winning as online channels steal transaction share.  You can’t pay for things with cash in a web browser. 

But as we move towards seamless checkout experiences that require nothing more than the single click of a \[PayPal, Masterpass, Visa Checkout, Amazon Pay\] checkout button, PayPal’s relative influence will only strengthen. And so, as incumbents tend to do when threatened by a competing proprietary solution, Visa and Mastercard are [making moralistic appeals to choice and standards.](https://www.pymnts.com/news/payment-methods/2018/mastercard-jess-turner-emvco-src/)

_“We are really calling on merchants, acquirers, issuers, technology players — really everyone in the ecosystem to come together and give consumers what they want,” \[Jess Turner, EVP of Digital Payments and Labs of North America at Mastercard\] said. “We really want to see everyone drive…the EMVCo SRC \[EMVCo is an organization managed by Visa, Mastercard, and 4 other schemes; Secure Remote Communication is a set of standards around security, authentication, and user experience for online payments\] standard so payments works across all browsers and devices. It’s foundational, and we need everyone in the ecosystem to join hands and do what’s right for the consumer.”_

Leveraging SRC, Visa and Mastercard recently announced that they would be merging their respective online checkout buttons into a shared payment button.  American Express and Discover, two other EMVCo member companies, may also join the union.  The rationale behind this move is that just as an offline merchant has a single terminal that accepts many different cards, so too should should an online merchant replace several different competing buttons with a single button compatible with all cards, alleviating complexity for itself and checkout friction for consumers. 

Earlier I described the insuperable network effects undergirding V/MA’s payment rails, but there is a separate chicken/egg problem to owning online checkout, one that Visa, et. al are attempting to solve by offering a single standard adopted by a critical mass of card networks.  Yet it seems to me that the lack of merchant enthusiasm for either Visa Checkout and Masterpass has never been about critical mass or ease of use, per se – Visa and Mastercard each have widely used cards and ubiquitous brands – but rather, the absence of a vastly superior checkout experience relative to the reigning online checkout incumbent, PayPal. It’s not clear to me that this new initiative, which subsumes several well-known brands under a new, unknown one, will spur the degree of online shopper adoption required to compel the broad online merchant acceptance that would make it a serious threat to PayPal.  For most online shoppers, default payment options are already set inside their PayPal wallets; the PayPal logo is familiar, trusted, and prominently displayed on checkout pages everywhere; and the user experience is great (or at least “good enough” not to switch: if you have habituated yourself to PayPal, as a growing number of online shoppers have, there is no compelling reason to click on a new button, branded with an unfamiliar logo).  PayPal already offers the consistent checkout experience across web properties promised by the new SRC standard.  And is button confusion really a thing?  Not to extrapolate too much from my narrow personal experience, but I gotta say, I’ve actually never run across an online checkout page littered with an overwhelming number of different payment buttons.  When was the last time you saw buttons from Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, etc. all side-by-side on a single page?  None of the incumbent networks have gained much traction here, so it stands to reason that there is no existing clutter problem among them to solve.

Still, it’s worth noting that the card schemes themselves have not imbued this one-button initiative with the combative overtones applied by the media, and the call for open standards and cooperation may be best taken at face value.  As I’ve said repeatedly, the regnant aim of Visa and Mastercard is to function as payments infrastructure, not directly own the consumer relationship.  Online checkout cart abandonment is so high ([greater than 75% in retail)](https://www.statista.com/statistics/457078/category-cart-abandonment-rate-worldwide/) that removing any bit of friction that tilts the shopper towards completing a purchase is a good outcome for V/MA – with their well known and trusted brands, Visa and Mastercard are likely to be top of whatever wallet anyways – and this becomes especially true as we start to consider a world of casual, high velocity shopping on payment-enabled IoT devices.

_Alternative approaches for B2B_

I mostly think of Mastercard and Visa as mostly similar companies that differ primarily by size and geographic mix.  But their respective strategies fork when we look beyond the core business of consumer payments, towards merchant services and B2B, as highlighted by the delightful micro jabs that Visa has taken at Mastercard over the last year.  Here are a few of my favs:

(On services)

Mastercard:_“\[Mastercard Advisors\] is really a super duper payments consulting company, and it’s kind of a cross between what McKinsey does from a strategy point of view, what Accenture does from an execution point of view, and that has been tremendously helpful as people around the world and the financial services companies, merchants, etc are trying to grapple with the changes that are coming down in the payments industry…”_

Visa: _“…we need to be careful not to take our money from a business that has really great returns and put them in a business that doesn’t have great returns. So our acquisitions have tended to be very targeted and very focused on things that enhance our core business. So we wouldn’t go out and buy a consulting firm and try to be McKinsey. That’s not our business.”_

Services now account for around a quarter of Mastercard’s revenue vs. ~10% for Visa, and indeed, the 45% margins that Mastercard earns on services – a blend of high margin data analytics and fraud detection products that leverage Mastercard’s anonymized payments data, and low margin consulting and spread-based rewards services – are below its low/mid-50s consolidated EBIT margins.  But who’s complaining about 45% EBIT margins?  Mastercard Advisors has been growing revenue by 20%-25% organically over the last 4 years, significantly faster than core payments.  Bundling services like analytics and rewards has proven an effective means of tightening merchant and issuer relationships, reinforcing the pillars of its payments business and driving market share gains.  Anonymized data from the payments business, in turn, differentiates the services business…for instance, using credit card sales data as a proxy, Mastercard can gauge consumer traffic on a city block to help a retailer decide where to open new branches.  So, building out the services over the last 6-7 years has been a good use of resources for Mastercard, both financially and strategically.

(on fast ACH vs. card rails)

Mastercard: _“…we now see governments around the world looking at these 30-, 40-year-old, archaic, batch-based ACH systems and looking to modernize them. And VocaLink \[a “fast” ACH\], when we surveyed the market, had by far the best technology to do it…..They had already been successful working with the Government of Singapore, implementation in Thailand, around the world. We saw more and more, either bank coalitions or governments, looking to say, how do we upgrade and improve our ACH system. Mastercard can now be a big part of that.”_

Visa: _“Real-time ACH is not new, right? It’s been around in many countries for a very long time and, in most cases, doesn’t have a lot of traction…The problem with a VocaLink-based approach is that VocaLink is now operational in just one market, the UK, and every ACH system around the world is different. Everyone is national…Some of them need a lot of investment to get them to real-time capability. Some of them are owned by banks. Some of them are owned by the central bank…building a global network using a technology or a capability like VocaLink, it’s going to take a long time and you won’t be able to do it in every country because every country has their own agenda.”\[ACH, in case you are not familiar, is a system used by depository institutions to process electronic payments.  In the US, financial institutions batch ACH transfers just three times per business day and can take several days to complete.  ACH is commonly used by consumers to pay utilities, mortgage payments, taxes, insurance premiums; by businesses to pay suppliers and directly deposit paychecks into employee bank accounts; and by governments to “push” tax refund and social security payments.  Visa’s and Mastercard’s rails might be more prominent, but ACH is the big kahuna of payment networks, processing [$41tn of payments in the US alone](https://www.nacha.org/news/what-ach-quick-facts-about-automated-clearing-house-ach-network)\]_.

(on B2B)

Mastercard: _“Before, we really attacked mostly $45 trillion of retail payments with a sliver of B2B payments. And we really widened the opportunity in terms of what we could be doing in the payments industry to $225 trillion, right. So that’s where we added about $120 trillion of business payments, another $60 trillion of P2P payments.”_

Visa: _“…I think it’s very important not to be seduced by a $120 trillion number partly because there’s some implication in that, that somehow it looks a lot like the consumer business. The consumer business is a very big — the B2C business is a very big, very homogenous business. The B2B business is highly segmented and very different across segments…as you get to the larger B2B space, there’s a question mark about what your value-added is because a lot of it becomes outsourcing, right? People are outsourcing the payables function. Is that a business where we have a lot of value to add to? And how much of the B2B business comes with yields that are attractive for our kind of business?”_

Just to scope the B2B dream, Visa and Mastercard combined process around $13tn in debit and credit payment volumes.  If you include commercial credit cards, B2B is around ~10%/11% of V/MA payment flows and has been growing faster than core consumer. If you back out China and Russia, I estimate that there’s around $30tn in relevant global PCE, $16tn of which is carded, leaving $14tn transacted through cash and check.  But outside the PCE category, Mastercard sees another ~$180tn B2B, P2P, and B2C uncarded opportunity, which it breaks out like this:

![](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/v_ma3.png)

You can see why Visa is incredulous.  After 50 years pursuing a $30tn TAM, turns out there’s another $180tn out there.  NBD! Up until a few years ago, Visa and Mastercard operated dumb, pull-only pipes, meaning you would swipe your card or input your credentials into a browser, and the merchant would “pull” money from your account.  But now, using the same exact rails, Visa and Mastercard allow payments to flow in the opposite direction.  With Visa Direct and Mastercard Send, funds can be securely pushed from one V/MA account to another: from Uber to its drivers, insurers to claimants, lenders to borrowers, governments to aid recipients, PayPal accounts to bank accounts, Square to small merchants…it’s basically the push capabilities of ACH, only faster. 

Also, unlike the technically and geographically fragmented constellation of ACH systems, Mastercard and Visa’s real time payment rails stretch across borders.  So why then did Mastercard pay a billion dollars for VocaLink? First, 11x EBITDA is not an unreasonable valuation for what seems a good business in its own right.  VocaLink operates (but does not own) the deeply embedded fast ACH payment system in the UK, which means it sees over 90% of the country’s payment flows, most of which are related to recurring, indispensable direct debits like payroll disbursements and mortgage payments (insight that Mastercard can now use for its services business).  Vocalink realizes yields comparable to Mastercard debit and generates 40% EBITDA margins from a combination of transactions, products, and services. 

Second, when it comes to B2B, ACH has significant incumbency advantage to card rails because every legal business has a bank account at a depository institution that is already synced to ACH.  Also, modern ERP systems and outsourced vendor management services more or less automate procurement processes and pay invoices through ACH(3).  While you could hypothetically run this volume on card rails, doing so would require wide merchant acceptance on both sides of the B2B transaction, as Visa Direct only allows you to send money to a bank account linked to a Visa debit or credit card.  And do businesses even regularly use their debit credentials?  When I set up the legal entity that owns scuttleblurb, I was issued a Visa debit card by my bank.  I promptly filed it away in a random drawer, sticker in tact, and have never looked at it, let alone used it, since. And actually, not even Visa disputes ACH’s prominent role in large dollar B2B; Visa Direct and Mastercard Send are both primarily positioned as B2C and P2P enablers. 

In B2B, Mastercard assumes outsourced administrative functions that are distinct from its responsibilities as a card network operator.  A business already knows its vendors well and hires intermediaries not so much to authenticate and efficiently route transactions, but rather to manage the vendor roster and ensure that valid invoices are reviewed and approved by the right people in the organization, paid in a timely manner, and reconciled with purchase orders.  Mastercard, in partnership with AP automation software vendor AvidXchange, does this stuff for small/mid-sized businesses through the B2B Hub that it launched last June.  I suppose network effects are relevant in that the the more suppliers that plug into the hub, the more valuable it is for small businesses to adopt it and vice versa…but this is still a highly competitive space and vendor-to-software integrations are common and non-rivalrous. 

The moat surrounding outsourced payables management is far narrower than the one protecting the card business.  Visa has its own version of B2B Hub, horribly named the Ready Program for Business Solutions – announced less than a week after Mastercard’s B2B Hub – but this initiative is clearly far down the list of priorities for Visa.  The company almost never discusses it and recently dismissed Mastercard’s foray into payables management as a low yield distraction where card networks add dubious value.  So, while Mastercard promulgates a $120tn global opportunity – including ~$25tn in North America – Visa assumes a more sober posture, limiting its purview to the $20tn that is addressable on card rails.  Even so, that’s a big number!…larger than the remaining non-carded consumer market. Based on Mastercard’s depiction of the B2B $TAM on its slides, you would be forgiven for thinking that the opportunity is about taxing $120tn of payment flow (as it does in the core card business)…but it’s more complicated than that. 

The idea is to use VocaLink’s fast ACH technology to modernize outdated, batch-based ACH systems around the world.  VocaLink has already extended its fast ACH technology to Singapore, Thailand, Sweden, and the US, and management claims that there are more than 25 countries who are looking to do likewise.  But, that does not necessarily mean operating the infrastructure layer and clipping transaction-based processing fees, as VocaLink does in the UK or as Mastercard does in its core debit and credit card business.  It can also mean licensing fast ACH technology to a clearinghouse, as VocaLink does in the US; or developing fee-based security analytics products that address corporate fraud and money laundering by leveraging data from ACH flows; or offering volume-based payment gateways and building consumer facing applications that run on top of ACH (like Pay By Bank, a push debit payment app); or any combination thereof.

What VocaLink’s economics will look like outside of the UK and when they will materialize are unknown.  I have a hard time envisioning Vocalink-operated ACH networks populating the globe and I don’t think the incremental profit dollars will ultimately be as compelling as the card business, as the entry barriers are lower.  Mastercard isn’t building 4-party acceptance of a proprietary network from scratch.  While it’s true that there is no interchange on ACH flows, providing more wiggle room for customers to pay for services, there is also more viable competition that will keep surplus extraction in check.  But the UK business is a good one and it alone may justify the price paid, so it’s not like Mastercard is betting the farm on a nebulous expansion opportunity. 

Visa and Mastercard trade at 30x and 36x earnings, respectively, valuations that do not seem _too_ demanding, at least in this market, when taking into consideration growth profiles and moatiness (right guys, _right_?!).  Both companies command dominant competitive advantages that grant them license to profitably absorb a growing proportion of $14tn of consumer cash transactions, steal share from antiquated domestic card schemes across numerous countries, and pursue an incipient but potentially vast B2B opportunity, sustaining low/mid-teens earnings growth for many years to come.

(1) From 2011-2017, it looks like Mastercard grew its payment volumes by ~13%/year while Visa did closer to ~10%/11% after you strip out the Visa Europe acquisition.  Mastercard’s faster growth can be explained by its relatively heavier tilt towards faster-growing non-US markets and its relative share gain therein (mid-teens vs. low-teens).  _\[In the US, Visa’s payments volume growth has outpaced that of Mastercard by a few points\]._
