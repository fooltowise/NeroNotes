# Forward Integrator

Under the right conditions, forward integration can be hugely valuable. There are several types of forward integration, including store ownership, franchising, licensing and internet selling (e-tailing) , each of which we examine below. Typically, the most successful forward integrators are powerful global brands: weaker brands struggle to draw shoppers to stores or traffic to websites. Consider LVMH's own store expansion over the past decade, Nike's success online (sales already exceed $1 billion), or the continued growth of franchised hotel brands such as Marriott or Holiday Inn. Whichever route is taken, the payoff can be great, though there are costs to consider in the form of incremental capital expenditures requirements and added complexity.
