# Signaling
Signaling is the need to send reliable indications of commitment and intent, which can inspire confidence and trust.  [[Cooperation]] is impossible unless a mechanism is in place to prevent deception and cheating: some degree of efficiency often needs to be sacrificed in order to convey trustworthiness or to build a reputation.


Reciprocation, [[Reputation as signaling|reputation]] and pre-commitment signaling are the three big mechanisms that underpin trust. You can repeatedly use a small local firm that needs your loyalty, you can use a larger company with a brand reputation, or you can trust someone who has made a big investment in getting a badge and stands to lose everything if he is caught cheating.
