In the first decade of the 21st century, securitization was common among the airline industry as a financing tool.

Here is how it works:
- The airline purchase a plane from an aircraft manufacturer at a significant, bulk discount to list price.
- Upon delivery, the aircraft is sold by the airline to a newly established securitization vehicle, *and subsequently leased back for the life of the aircraft*.
- The securitization vehicle issues Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (EETC) to investors. Lease payments are tranched, with investors who take on the greatest default risk (junior note holders) receiving more and those who take on the least risk (senior tranches) getting less. 
- Compared to a conventional debt instrument, what makes securitization so attractive is the fact that the airline often retains the junior tranches. These become an asset on their balance sheet.
- Any discount  associated with the low credit rating of these layers is more than offset by the discount  on the purchase of the aircraft, thereby creating an immediate profit and cash inflow on delivery of the aircraft.
- Under good, even normal business conditions, the airline makes lease payments to the securitization vehicle. But in a recession or a bankruptcy filing, when payments are suspended, the owner of the senior strate are able to seize the collateral.
- The junior participants in the securitization have no rights, and any such assets on the airline's balance sheet must be written down to zero, further increasing the airline's losses.
- By this clever piece of financial engineering, the airlines gets shiny new planes for an extremely low cost of funds (at the time as low as 6%) while equity shareholders carry nearly all of the business risk. That an industry which has rarely earned an acceptable return on capital should have access to such cheap capital is quite astonishing.

Between 2002 and 2011, north american airlines have been on a spree of bankruptcies due in part to this financing scheme: United airlines (December 2002), Air Canada (April 2003), US Airways (September 2004), Northwest (September 2005),  Delta (September 2005) and American Airlines (November 2011).
