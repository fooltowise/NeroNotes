# Business as an Ecosystem

> I find it quite useful to think of a free market economy - or partly free market economy - as sort of the equivalent of an [[Ecosystems| ecosystem]]. Just as animals flourish in niches, people who specialize in some narrow niche can do very well.

>This is a very unfashionable way of thinking because early in the days after Darwin came along, people like the robber barons assumed that the doctrine of the survival of the fittest authenticated them as deserving power. But the truth is that it is a lot like an ecosystem. And you get many of the same results.

> In business we often find that the winning system goes almost ridiculously far in maximizing and/or minimizing one or a few variables - like the discount warehouses at Costco.
