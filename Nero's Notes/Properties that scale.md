Geoffrey West observed that there are relationships between the dimensions of beings and objects, and the way their properties evolve.

These relationships are often following power laws. For instance, doubling the size of a mammal result in a metabolic rate increase of only 75% (3/4), and this whatever the size of the initial mammal.

Same for the length and diameter of the aorta: they seem to increase by 25% (1/4) when we double the size of a mammal.
