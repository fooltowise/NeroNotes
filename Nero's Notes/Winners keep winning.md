## Description:

If the winner of a competition is systematically rewarded with means allowing him to win again, a reinforcing loop is created by which winners end up with winning everything, and losers are eliminated.

## Solution:

- Diversify. This allows losers to get out of the game and to start a new one.
- Strict limitation of the fraction of the pie that the winner can win (anti-trust laws)
- Policies leveling the game field, removing some of the advantages of the strongest players, while increasing the advantage of the weakest ones.
- Policies devising rewards for success that do not biases the next round of competition
