# Limits to Isometric scaling
*Isometric Scaling* is about multiplying all dimensions of an object by a constant while keeping its shape constant. It very rarely happens in nature.

*Allometric Scaling* happens when the dimensions of an organism are changed, and as a result the shape is changed as well so the entity can keep working as expected.Exemple: the human body's proportions will change as it grows from a baby (big head, clunky members) to an adult.



Galileo Galilei was the first to point out in *Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences* that there is a limit to isometric growth.  For any object in nature, doubling its dimensions will result in a volume multiplied by 8 (2 * 2 * 2). Ditto for its weight. On the other hand, its strength and resistance are only proportional to the area of the cross section of its elements. The strength of a muscle is proportional to the area of its cross section. Same thing for the solidity of a bone. Therefore, while the weight is multiplied by 8, strength and solidity are only multiplied by 4.  As we continue increasing the dimensions of an object while keeping its shape constant, there will come a point where it will crush under its own weight.

This is why elephants have trunk-like legs, or why horses can easily break their legs when they fall from a modest height. And why cats on the other hand seem to not be bothered by falls from a much higher height.
