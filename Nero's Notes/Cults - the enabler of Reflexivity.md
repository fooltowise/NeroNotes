When belief in a company transcends fandom and borderlines on religion, rationality barely matters. 

Irrational pricing is what enables companies (like Tesla) to raise capital, tackle new ideas, and stir up exuberance again. Rinse, repeat.

Or consider Bitcoin: value is *believed* into existence by converting new followers, and stability emerges only after “irrational” actors lay the foundation.
