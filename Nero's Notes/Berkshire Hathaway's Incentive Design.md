# How [[Warren Buffett]] Rewards Berkshire's Managers For Using Less Capital

### by Adam Mead

[[Warren Buffett]] has provided lots of hints on Berkshire’s compensation arrangements with managers. At times, such as at the 1995 annual meeting (video below), he’s also discussed how a manager can be rewarded for releasing capital.

A question about the mechanics of that arrangement prompted a somewhat lengthy response in the comments section and the idea to bring this wonderful group of readers into the discussion.

**How (I Think) It’s Done:**

Berkshire has many different businesses. Some are capital intensive (like BNSF or BHE). Others use very little capital (think Business Wire). The focus here is on those that use capital.

Perhaps the best way to think about this is to look at it forward and then backward (i.e. invert). Let’s see how the arrangement works for a manager using additional capital. But first, a base case to set the stage.

_Base case:_

Let's say a BRK subsidiary uses $100m of capital. Buffett perhaps sets a base salary for the person and then incentivizes them by giving them 10% of any profits over a 15% return on capital.[1](https://watchlistinvesting.substack.com/p/how-warren-buffett-rewards-berkshires#footnote-1) The business earns 20% or $20m and the manager gets a bonus of $500k ($20m minus $15m bogey = $5m x 10% = $500k).

_Use of Additional Capital:_

If that manager wants an additional $100m, say, they're going to want to be very sure they can earn at least 15% on that capital. If they can't then their bonus could be in jeopardy. If profits went from $20m to $30m but they employed $200m capital, then earnings would just meet the threshold and the manager wouldn't get a bonus. Still with me?

_Returning Capital:_

Now let's say that manager is working under the original scenario with $100m in capital but finds a way to do business with $90m. So they've sent $10m back to Omaha but still earn $20m. Well, that's just another way of saying return on capital increased from 20% to 22.2% ($20m / $90m). What does the manager earn for a bonus?

A 15% return would be $13.5m. So $20m - $13.5m = $6.5m. The bonus, at 10%, is $650k. So that manager has earned an additional $150k by figuring out how to earn the same amount of money with less capital. The manager gets $150k more and Berkshire gets $10m to allocate elsewhere.[2](https://watchlistinvesting.substack.com/p/how-warren-buffett-rewards-berkshires#footnote-2)

Simple, rational, and tied to the business.
