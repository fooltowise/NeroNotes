### Scott, can you share some context to [[Wingstop]] and the strategy, when you joined in 2004?

It was a small company of under 200 units; we had about 150 when I joined. We had another 75 or 100 in the pipeline. I remember when we opened up our 200thstore, it was a really big deal. It was in Las Vegas which became a really strong market for [[Wingstop]], over time. During my time there, we got close to 1,000 stores.

### Can you describe the original concept of [[Wingstop]]?

It was an interesting concept. Antonio Swad created [[Wingstop]] and, initially, they weren’t open during the daytime; they opened up at 4:00 in the afternoon until 11:00 or 12:00 at night. The thought was, someone who was retired could buy a retirement business, maybe go golfing during the day and run their business at night. Over time, there was a lot of pressure on sales to expand. If you can expand the day part, it’s almost a no-brainer. [[Wingstop]] eventually opened up for lunch.

There was a lot of initial push back from the original franchisees when that happened, because a lot of people liked the concept of just being open in the evening and not worrying about the restaurant during the day. Lunch didn’t take off at first; it took some growing. Eventually, the concept evolved out from a retired mailman buying a [[Wingstop]] franchise and operating it in the evening.

Another part of the initial start up was to not have a good location; to have a C location, a cheap location. Instead of paying $2,500 or $3,000 a month rent, to be on the corner slot, [[Wingstop]] encouraged you to buy the $1,500 rent slot, in the shopping center, two blocks away. That has also changed over time. You now want to have a great location and great sales. The initial [[Wingstop]] also took a couple of years to finds its customers. A franchisee could expect very low sales for the first two years and then start getting ramped up as more people started to get to know about you, to build your customer base that way.

They are now sourcing large multi-unit franchisors; people that can do 10, 15 or 20 locations without a problem.

### But they do say that they even today they still look for only B and B minus locations; not the fully prime locations?

A lot of the franchisees that I worked with were looking at more and more prime locations. That might be in their sales literature.

### So were those core, original franchisees retired males?

Yes, I would say that, typically, it was a male franchisee. A lot of husband and wife teams did it; it was often a family business. Maybe their kids were working the fryer, dad is cooking and mom is on the front register. That was very common in the early days.

### What is so unique about the menu?

It’s so simple. A lot of restaurants think that if you add apple pies and so on, you’re going to increase sales. [[Wingstop]] was, pretty much, singularly focused. The economics of wings, over time, necessitated the installation of tenders and nuggets as the breast is more prevalent and easier to source than the wings. That was a hedge against the up and down wing market.

Basically, they’ve kept their menu simple. During the last crisis they tried chicken thighs and my understanding was that it didn’t go very well. The challenge with wings is that every chicken just grows two. When you think about a 10-wing order, it took five chickens to produce that. But generally, it has stayed singularly focused on chicken with just a couple of simple sides to go with it.

### What is the $390,000 initial capex spend actually for?

It finishes out the space. Often, you will get a naked space that needs plumbing, adjusting, vent hoods and things like that, plus the cost of equipment. I think the investment is on the low end of the food service industry, as far as entry is concerned. One of the key reasons to [[Wingstop]]’s success is that they were so singularly focused and the food was cooked to order. They didn’t have heat lamps with a bunch of wings; if you walked in and ordered a 10 piece, it was dropped for you and you were told it will be 14 minutes. If you sat down and ate them, you were getting this piping hot piece of chicken and you were going to come back because it was a memorable experience. One of the keys to success is the cooked to order freshness.

They also had cravable flavors. I worked there for 10 years and I ate wings almost every day, I’m ashamed to say, but the flavors were cravable; you don’t get tired of them. It’s an interesting and unique product.

### What exactly is the equipment required?

Basically, fryers, refrigeration and a small area of prep. I think the equipment package is still under $100,000. A lot of the $300,000 or $400,000 is finishing out the spot to have restrooms and so on.

### The equipment seems really cheap?

Correct; the barrier to entry to opening up a wing place is not high. You need a fryer, a cash register and some area of refrigeration to store your food. What [[Wingstop]] has done is pretty amazing and they really don’t have any competition in this space. There are no other large players doing what they do, exclusively sticking with chicken and wings. Even Buffalo Wild Wings has burgers, salads and a whole menu. They are really unique in the food service area.

### What makes [[Wingstop]] so disciplined to stick to just wings?

I think that singular focus allowed people that weren’t restaurant people to come in to the system and all you had to do was to execute chicken properly. If you cooked the chicken for 14 minutes and tossed it in the sauce, you were going to have a happy customer. It was very simple. Whereas if it had a broader menu, it requires a different skill set. I think the simplicity of it made it easy for the early investors to execute and to have good operations; high quality food, clean restaurants and friendly service.

As I said, in a lot of those early stores, the wife was running the register, so she was always going to be friendly to the customers. For the most part, dad was cooking the chicken and either an employee – or maybe another family member – was cooking fries. It was a small operation; not like it is now, with the average unit volumes at about a million and a half. They probably have 25 or 30 staff at each restaurant. It’s now a whole different ballgame.

### How does the fact that it is relatively simple to run change the attraction to potential franchisees, versus other chains or formats?

Let’s just say I’m a retired banker and I want to dip my toe into the restaurant business; I can get my head around a simple operation. But if you start thinking about a Buffalo Wild Wings, that’s a full-blown restaurant and is very complex. You can get your arms around running a simple, in line space. I think the simplicity of it is the beauty of it, on so many levels. You are able to execute to the guests properly and consistently. The whole operation being so simple is the key to the success.

I came on after they’d been around for a few years and I’d heard the initial stories about sales being very low. I can see the temptation had been there to, say, add a burger in here; let’s add hot dogs; let’s do this, that and the other. But they didn’t. They just stuck with the vision that Antonio Swad had.

I just watched them grow. In the 10 or 11 years I was there, we had same store sales growth every single quarter. It was a great place to work.

### What drives that consistency in same store sales growth?

I think it’s the things that I’ve been talking about. If you come in, every time, and we cook your wings just for you, with the flavor you want, you get it and it’s hot. It’s not as if we left them under the heat lamps a bit too long. If you do it properly, there’s no room for error. The fries are also cooked to order, so there is no bin holding a bunch of French fries. Sometimes, when you go out, you get great hot, crispy French fries; other times, you get soggy, limp ones. That didn’t happen at [[Wingstop]]; there were no heat lamps or places to hold food. I think you got consistently good food; you had small, family-run businesses, so you always had good service, and the point of pride of small, family-run business is that the store is always clean. I’ve literally had franchisees that I would visit where you could eat off the floor. I remember a guy in Abilene, Texas, his restaurant was so clean, you could actually eat off the floor. It was spotless.

There are a lot of anecdotal stories like that about franchisees that had really rough financial times for the first couple of years and then it would just take off for them and they would end up being very wealthy people. There are a lot of [[Wingstop]] millionaires out there, right now.

### Looking at the growth in store count, why are the three largest states California, Texas and Illinois?

When we opened the sixth or seventh store, in California, we opened it in Oakland. There was a little retail pad on the [[Walmart]] parking lot that faced [[Walmart]] and it was right down the road from Oakland airport. That restaurant opened up doing $15,000 a week. That may not sound like a lot of money, but the AUVs, at that time, were $8,000 or $9,000 a week. [[Walmart]] wasn’t open yet. When [[Walmart]] opened, it jumped to $30,000 a week and [[Wingstop]] had never seen those sales. The success of that restaurant, coming off what the average was, showed the potential for [[Wingstop]] in certain locations, especially in California. Because of that restaurant, we sold a lot of franchises in California and northern California just really took off.

Then in southern California, there still is a franchisee who now has about 40 or 50 Wingstops and he started with one. He grew the LA market, along with a few other franchisees. The restaurants really started taking off with the advent of lunch. California has always had huge volumes.

Texas is the home state of [[Wingstop]] and so it grew well there. It’s got all the big cities in Texas. I think there are probably 350 or 400, just in Texas alone. Illinois came later but, again, the first store in Illinois was very, very successful. They got sales up to $40,000 or $50,000 a week.

### Why was the first store in Illinois so good?

It was in a crappy, dirty shopping center and those guys were doing as much, in a day, that other Wingstops were doing in a week.

### Is it just different parts of the country take to wings differently?

I think wings are a blue-collar meal for a lot of people, so [[Wingstop]] did really well in the early days where the early adapters were the blue-collar neighborhoods where Joe SixPack was going to get a beer and some wings on the way home. Now they are doing well everywhere; it’s now a more acceptable type of food. An interesting statistic that came along later was that men are the users of [[Wingstop]], but women decide the purchase. There are a lot of women that go to [[Wingstop]] to buy for Monday Night Football for dad and the kids or for when they’ve got their friends coming over for Super Bowl. Super Bowl was crazy; the average restaurant would do three, four or five times what they did on a normal day.

The Super Bowl is another big thing that, I think, helped enhance the popularity; wings and football are almost inseparable. If you look at the popularity of football, in the United States, and the popularly of [[Wingstop]], I think you will find a correlation there. Football and wings became synonymous with each other and now you’ve got Thursday Night Football, Monday Night Football plus football at the weekend. Football is on three, four or five days a week so it became that wings could almost become an everyday event.

### Is there any reason, in your mind, why a certain part of the country may not hit the same AUVs?

The Southeastern United States had a wing presence with a lot of mom-and-pop wing places. The Southeast was a tougher market to crack. The Northeast is a different animal too, because of the population densities. It’s very expensive to do business in New York City. The people that are used to going and renting a space in Texas, for $2,000, $3,000 or $4,000 a month might find that, in New York City, it’s $12,000 a month. Some of those numbers are very scary to potential investors. [[Wingstop]] is making inroads in the Northeast, but it’s still a lagging part of the country.

### It’s just much more competitive in the Southeast and it put pressure on order volumes?

You might have your favorite – Joe’s Wings – so if [[Wingstop]] opens up, it’s not as big a deal. Whereas in Illinois, California or Bozeman, Montana, you open up and no one has ever had a wing place before so it becomes a bigger deal.

### Management has released a slide in their recent earnings saying that, in the West and Southwest, you’ve got AUVs at roughly 1.5 million and, in the North and Southeast, as you said, it’s more difficult and there are only roughly 880,000. How do you think [[Wingstop]] could improve AUVs in the North and Southeast, towards that 1.5 million?

I think it’s just a matter of time. It is still relatively new, compared to how long they’ve been around in Texas. California just took off and, given the population of California, we found a lot of markets were under-restauranted; there were places that needed more restaurants and [[Wingstop]] stepped in and filled a gap. Again, the population densities and doing business in California and doing business in Texas and some of those states is just very different. The South, given that they had the mom-and-pop places sprinkled around made it a little more challenging to get the brand out there. I think, over time, [[Wingstop]] will conquer that.

### How can fortressing change the AUVs in the North and Southeast?

Another issue is penetration and marketing dollars? Let’s say you are trying to penetrate Baltimore, if you have six stores in Baltimore, you can’t afford to do much advertising. You would probably need to have 50 stores in Baltimore to properly advertise. I interviewed with Starbucks at one point and I think the lady told me they have something like 200 Starbucks in Manhattan; just a crazy number. I was in Chicago last week and there was a Starbucks on every corner and Starbucks doesn’t really market that much. For a fast, casual restaurant chain, to have money to market and be effective, you have to have market penetration. In the newer markets, there’s firstly a challenge getting into the markets and then, secondly, penetrating enough to be a noted presence where you become top of mind among the customers.

### [[Wingstop]] recently moved from a local advertising plan to national, but that still gets allocated on a regional basis, roughly based on number of stores? The higher the number of stores, the more dollars you get in Baltimore, for example?

Yes, and to have a budget to be national. When I was there, it was a big deal that we would be on a football night on Monday; maybe we had one ad. Coke has 22 ads on a football game. It’s just a matter of your budget and being able to make impressions to become top of mind so when people go to lunch on Monday, they’re thinking about you.

### What do you think could be a potential limitation or challenge to growing new stores, in the US?

I think there’s a lot of fight for the franchise dollar right now; there are a lot of companies that are out there, selling franchises. From the franchisee side, a lot of people are looking at what is going to be the next big thing to hit? Is the air about to rise in this new, latest, greatest thing? Is this going to be the new McDonald’s? Everybody wants to grow but there is a lot of competition for those franchise dollars.

### But do they other franchises have the 40-50% unlevered cash on cash return, that [[Wingstop]] has?

Very few do. [[Wingstop]] is not owner-operated for the land and building; there are a lot of franchises where people want to develop the land. It just depends on the objectives of the investor. When it was mom-and-pop, it was easier to say, we don’t have one here, in Lubbock, Texas; let’s put one here and, with a 200,000 population maybe, eventually, we could have two or three. Now they are looking at investors that are going to take on Baltimore, for example, and, over time, maybe build 20 or 30 stores. But the numbers have to line up. You have to find a shopping center with a good enough rent, that meets the demographics that you are looking for. It’s much more scientific now than it was back in the day.

### How do the more professional franchisees look at the return, to choose [[Wingstop]] versus the old mom-and-pop smaller franchisees?

Everybody is looking for return on investment. I think the challenge is probably finding locations. As I said, the fast casual segment is very popular. You’ve got Chipotle, Jimmy John’s and all the variations that are all fighting for the same spot. If a corner spot opens up in XYZ shopping center, you might be the fifth guy to call and it might be too late.

In the newer parts of town, where it’s maybe easier to get a spot, you might have to wait a couple of years for the spot to develop. Maybe the housing development is running behind a year and they’re building a shopping center counting on the housing development and, all of a sudden, everything doesn’t line up quite right. But as the area matures, you will see the sales growth you were anticipating. There are a lot of different challenges in different parts of the country.

### When you talked about the franchisees wanting to develop the land, are you suggesting that, because [[Wingstop]] is now bigger and they are going after larger regions, looking for franchisees that can do 20, 30, 40 stores, instead of one or two, that franchisee looks at different things to earn their return and require different skill sets from the mom-and-pop franchisees?

Yes, I think so. You still need the restaurant manager; you still need a great crew. You need district managers and a director of operations. If you have a 20-store organization, it is run very differently from the original mom-and-pop store. You can see that, sometimes, if you are with an organization where things aren’t running quite right. Maybe the cleanliness isn’t quite there; maybe the service isn’t quite right; maybe the crew uniforms aren’t quite right. In my opinion, some of the bigger organizations lose some control. I’m not talking [[Wingstop]] specifically. We’ve all gone into a place where you know that wasn’t how it was envisaged; that your lunch or your sandwich wasn’t going to look like that, that your service wasn’t going to be snarky. I think those are the challenges with larger franchisees versus the original mom-and-pops.

### Can we step into the shoes of a large franchisee? Someone who is going to build out a city or 20, 30, 40 stores? How do they look at [[Wingstop]] versus Buffalo Wild Wings or another concept?

I think they all go in wanted to be that million and a half dollar store. The reality is, if you have 10 stores, you might have two at two million, two at 700,000 and you might have two at a million. The secret is, how do you build the $2 million stores first so it all works out? What happens, on occasion, is you build a $700,000 store, then you build another $700,000 store and you say, you know what, I don’t know if this thing is going to go in this part of the world, so a lot of the development deals go away at that point.

Now the guy that opens up a $2 million store and then he opens up a $1.5 million store, he is signing leases all over the place; he wants to get this thing going. I think, sometimes, having the patience and the understanding of the ebb and flow of a concept is important. If you have a portfolio of restaurants, you are very lucky if they are all performing at the highest level.

### Can we just walk through the economics? Of the $390,000 initial capex, how much does the franchisee need? Do they need the full $390,000 or can they borrow from the bank?

I think for the SBA, it is 20%; if you have $80,000 or so, you could probably go in and borrow that much with the SBA loan, if you have good credit and things like that.

### The levered return must be incredible?

If you and I went and bought a [[Wingstop]] and it only did $700,000 but you and I were working there, we’d probably do okay and be happy. But if we buy that and we hire a manager, an assistant manager and have all the other parts of that, it may be a breakeven proposition. Different objectives, different outcomes, different things people invest in.

### In your experience, what are some of the reasons why there is a $700,000 store? What is the reason they don’t get to that $1.5 million?

In my experience at [[Wingstop]], we had one location, in Illinois, where the traffic was just booming on this road in front of it, but the shopping center that it was in had very low traffic; there were a few empty spots. Sometimes you have a location that is not where you’re going, but where you’re going past. If you’re going to the shopping center for the dry cleaning, maybe you pick up dinner there. Maybe you go to the grocery store, you go to the laundromat and then you pick up some wings to take home, so mom doesn’t have to cook tonight.

But then you may have a shopping center where people aren’t going in, for whatever reason – obviously, the developer of this shopping center wasn’t a dummy; they’ve invested millions of dollars – but there are tons of cars going past. There was a Kentucky Fried Chicken across the way that had closed down but, again, the traffic would say, hey, this is going to be a great spot. This wasn’t in downtown Chicago; it was one of the far out suburbs, about an hour out of town. For some reason, people didn’t stop on this street. They were going to the shopping center a mile down here or they were going to the shopping center a mile down there, but they didn’t stop there.

Honestly, sometimes it’s luck; sometimes you create your own luck. Let’s say this person is an amazing marketer and he has the radio station down there, with flags going on out front; maybe there is a guy in a chicken suit walking around. Maybe this guy could work. But maybe the guy that bought that plot says, I don’t want to do a chicken suit; I’m not going to call the radio station. I invested my money; where’s my return? There are a lot of people like that. Business doesn’t work like that; entrepreneurship doesn’t work like that. You are always taking a risk with any investment.

I guess there is an answer somewhere, but sometimes the people that are supposed to know, maybe don’t know.

### Going back to the original point, what could be the challenge to long-term growth? They’ve got roughly 1,600 stores today; they have plans to grow to 3,000 in the US, 3,000 internationally. So you’re suggesting one of the biggest challenges is really just getting access to those larger franchisee investors that can scale cities and regions?

Yes. The reason that companies go the franchise model is because they don’t have the funds, the resources or the talent to do it themselves. Very few companies have done that. I believe In-N-Out Burger have done it; it is not quite a franchise system that they have. It is a West Coast family-owned business and I think they finance their own growth and they only grow what they can afford to grow. On the other side of that, they’ve got a lot more control. If you are a franchisee, I’m trusting you to do our vision of the clean store, the friendly service and providing hot fresh food to every guest. If you decide to take short cuts, I can talk to you, we can write you letters to ask you not to do that anymore but, at the end of the day, you are the owner of that business, doing what you think is right but it may not be right for this system or the chain.

### Do you think there is any reason why they can’t get to 3,000 stores in the US, over time?

No; I think they’ll do it. I don’t know what their time goal is but I think it’s a well-run company; Charlie Morrison is a really sharp guy.

### How do you look at how the value proposition translates internationally?

I don’t know, but it’s an excellent point. The price of wings has always been a challenge. Sometimes it will go up and sometimes it goes down, but when it goes up, you struggle with that price value. There were times when the wing prices were so high that we had to ask the franchisees to suck it up for a few months, until the wing prices came back down, where we should have properly charged $13 for a lunch order. Now, that’s not such a big deal to pay $10 or $13 for lunch, but 10 years ago, it was a big deal and you start looking at the price value proposition.

I think we’ve all gone into a restaurant where you’ve said, the food was okay, the service was good, but $150? The price value proposition didn’t match the guest expectation. I think that is a challenge in the wing business. Right now, wings are very hard to source and I know that [[Wingstop]] currently has some challenges keeping all the stores growing.

### I think they recently increased the prices 10% to combat that inflation; 5% to the franchisee and they are wearing 5% themselves which, obviously, pushes up that price and the price to value proposition is tricky.

Unless you and I are getting a raise at the same time, more of our dining out budget goes on that. Maybe instead of eating out five or six times a week, we start eating out three or four times a week, just to offset it.

### Can we walk through sourcing chicken and, specifically, the bone-in wings which I think is about 60% of the chicken COGS but 30% of the total cost of sales. What is the first step in sourcing those bone-in wings?

There is a whole team of people that are sourcing chicken all the time, talking to all the different growers and manufacturers. When I was there, we had people at every poultry event in the country, making contacts with all the different chicken companies, just to have the relationships and places to source the birds. I’m guessing they have an even bigger and better purchasing department now.

### Do they buy centrally, for every store?

Yes; they arrange for the distributor to have enough chicken. If your restaurant uses 100 cases a week and mine uses 100 cases a week, [[Wingstop]] is going to make sure the distributor has those 200 cases a week that we need. Additionally, they do fresh chicken, so it’s not frozen. The other challenge is that the chicken has to be killed and used within about seven days. There is a whole balancing act in that realm.

### The chicken that they source for the stores is mainly fresh?

Correct. The chicken that is maybe killed on a Saturday is showing up at your restaurant on Thursday.

### Why do they use a distributor versus doing it themselves or doing part of it themselves, in the supply chain? I think PFG is their distributor.

I think it’s a very expensive, specialized industry. Those people gather products from all over the country. Even an operation like [[Wingstop]] probably has 150 items they order every week, from straws, lids, cups, napkins, paper towels, toilet paper. We could go on and on; each different sauce, the ingredients for the beans. Each of their dressings have three, four or five ingredients. All of a sudden it doesn’t seem like it, but you have 150 items. The warehouses and the distribution people earn their keep, in my opinion.

### Given that it’s mainly fresh chicken, how often do you have to buy? Is it weekly replenishment?

They are projecting the usage of each restaurant, pretty closely, and placing orders based on the projected usage.

### Per week or per month?

Probably per week but, I believe, that a chicken has a shelf life of about 10 days from the kill date. If a chicken is killed on the 1st, I think it expires on the 10th, where it’s not edible anymore. They keep it really cold, just a tad above freezing; it’s kept at 33° or 34° to extend the shelf life as much as possible.

### The distributor does the cold chain logistics and then ships it?

I think the chicken plant has their trucks that ship it to a distributor, rather than going to each individual restaurant. For the convenience of the operation of the restaurant manager, you don’t want 20 deliveries a day; you just want your deliveries to come on Tuesday and Thursday and then you are only dealing with it twice a week.

### Why are the wings priced on the spot market, versus the boneless is annual and fixed price?

A lot of those products are frozen and the chickens are grown for the breast; they are not grown for the wing. I think the life of a chicken is about six to eight weeks from birth to when they kill it; it’s a short lifespan. Pilgrim’s will decide how many eggs to hatch today and those chickens are fed and grow into full size. Often, the size of the wings varies depending on whether they kill the chickens on Friday or Monday; it could grow an extra pound over the weekend. The boneless wings and tenders – the tender is a specific part of the breast – are basically chunks of the breast.

### You can buy them annually, from a farmer?

You buy them a little differently from the wings.

### As you said, the farmers grow the chickens mainly for the breasts because they are sold forward, a year in advance?

Yes; the breast meat can be frozen; all those products are frozen.

### Why can the breast be frozen but the wings can’t?

If you look at the bone of a chicken that you’re eating, the color changes. If it’s been frozen, it’s kind of a strange color; if it’s not frozen, it’s not. It’s more appetizing. Also, the wings come out differently. A frozen product has a lot of moisture added to it to stay tender during freezing then, when it defrosts, all this moisture comes out. It’s a different product. It’s much better to do it with fresh chicken wings.

### Given that the chicken wings are priced by the pound and sold by the wing, how do you manage that?

Everything is sold by the pound. [[Wingstop]] sells them by the piece; you buy a 10-piece or 20-piece. But they are buying it by the pound. When the chickens are bigger, there are less wings per pound and when the chicken is smaller, there are more wings per pound. That is just a challenge than [[Wingstop]] has had and it’s always going to be just because chickens grow at different rates, are different sizes and how they manufacture and kill them is all part of that.

All the time I was at [[Wingstop]], we were never guaranteed any chicken wing count by the distributors.

### As you said, that’s because they have a very short shelf life, plus you can’t freeze them, so you have to buy them fresh, on the spot market. Let’s take, for example, February this year, the price per pound, for wings, was $2.50. How many wings do you get per pound?

Probably six or seven wings per pound.

### Then you try and optimize the price per piece?

Yes; maybe this month we’re getting six and next month we’re getting eight; if you order a 20-piece, the cost to the franchisee is 25%. That is one of the major challenges of owning and operating a [[Wingstop]].

### Do you pass that cost straight onto the franchisee?

Yes; it’s always the franchisee. [[Wingstop]] corporate gets their cut; every Wednesday they draft your account for their percentage. The franchisee deals with the food cost ups and downs and the cost of operations.

### Is it really that volatile for the franchisee?

It’s fairly consistent. Over the course of six months, you know it’s going to average seven. But during time, you might have some weeks at six and you might have some weeks at eight and you might have some that are scattered in between.

### Is the price of the breast related to the price of the wing?

Not really; the breast is more consistent because they plan that out. They grow the chicken for the breast. The wing is a by-product so the supply is dependent on how many breasts they sell. For example, let’s say they needed the breasts of 100 chickens, the supply of wings is only going to be 200. They know, basically, how much Chick-fil-A is going to need, they know how much McDonald’s is going to need, so they can project all that out. But the part that they can’t project out is that the wings are a by-product. You might eat 20 wings today and you might not eat wings again till the next World Cup. If a lot of people start eating 20 wings a day, all of a sudden, you have prices fluctuating, based on supply and demand.

### Management have been discussing the new ‘whole bird’ strategy; they’re introducing thighs as well as more boneless chicken. How do you think this strategic move can help mitigate that price volatility of the wings?

I think it might help a little bit but I think [[Wingstop]] is based on wings. The boneless wings – aka the breast – is not their bread and butter and the other things might help mitigate it a little bit, but I don’t think it’s going to become a Popeyes or something like that. A company like Popeyes or KFC buys the whole chicken. Everything they are doing is based on that.

### Can’t [[Wingstop]] do that?

They could, but I don’t think that’s the market. I always wondered why KFC and Popeyes let there be a [[Wingstop]]. They had the chicken; they had the locations. [[Wingstop]] is the chicken business, but it’s also a slightly different business.

### Why do you think they did let [[Wingstop]] have the wings?

I don’t know; it’s a mystery. I’ve always wondered why the big chicken guys didn’t grab onto the wing model right away. They still don’t. I don’t think about going to Kentucky Fried Chicken or Popeyes if I want chicken wings for the Super Bowl; I’m going to go to [[Wingstop]].

### Is it this price volatility question where they just didn’t see the need of putting risk into their model of pricing wings, on a weekly basis?

I don’t know. Why does GM let there be a Tesla because now, I think it’s too late? Sometimes, I think business leaders are happy with the status quo and they don’t want to mess with what’s working for them so they don’t see the emerging demands in technologies, until it’s too late.

### In an average store, what percentage of the revenue is the wings, roughly?

Wings are the core. If you have a party, some people don’t like to eat bone-in chicken, so you’ve got the other chicken.

### Are wings 60% or 70% or is it even higher than that?

I would think it’s probably around the 65% area, for wings.

### If management can move slightly towards more boneless, which they can buy on an annual basis, it could mitigate the volatility?

That was the whole point of adding the boneless products.

### So you’re saying that in your experience, it didn’t change much, because people just come for the wings?

It did a bit. You can also have the boneless products tossed in your favorite sauces, so that’s also a little different from what the other guys offer.

### Who do you see as the biggest competitor to [[Wingstop]]?

I think they found a niche, they exploited it and I don’t think there is a strong number two player in that field. I think there are some mom-and-pops; you can get wings anywhere now, for the most part. But when you think about wings or you think about the Super Bowl or going to a New Year’s party to take something, they are the go to for that kind of stuff.

### Let’s say, if I am McDonald’s or KFC and, obviously, I have the volume. I sell mainly the breast so I’ve probably got more important relationships with the suppliers, the farmers. Couldn’t I just crush [[Wingstop]] and say, take all the chickens?

Pizza Hut kind of tried that with WingStreet. I honestly don’t know how WingStreet is doing but I don’t really see them anymore. At one point, I believe there were a couple of the pizza chains looking at buying [[Wingstop]], when it was being sold, in its younger days. They ended up not doing it, figuring they could just do it themselves. I just don’t think the market looked at wings as a full concept. They’ve added some ancillary products but they have proved that wings was a concept. There are a few minor players out there, but nobody with 1,500 restaurants; I don’t think there is even anybody with 500. I just think they own that space.

### What do you think is the biggest risk in terms of sourcing chicken, given the dynamics?

The supply chain for chicken has always been the major challenge that [[Wingstop]] faces. I think adding thighs this year proved that out. Sourcing chicken is their biggest threat.

### Can’t they own the farms?

That would be a whole different business but, again, you’re not growing chicken for the wings. The money is in the breast.

### What is the solution? What would you do?

I don’t know. It’s an age-old problem. The joke used to be, we wish we could figure out how to grow a chicken with four wings. John Madden, in the football games on Thanksgiving, used to have the turkey with six turkey legs on it. That’s the [[Wingstop]] challenge; sourcing chicken. If you had Charlie Morrison on today, I’m sure that’s what he would tell you.

### Hopefully, for their sake, the thighs can take off. I think they mentioned that they are buying smaller birds, where they can buy the whole bird.

It’s just one of the challenges where they are trying to think outside the box.

### When we really think about [[Wingstop]]’s customer base, over 75% of [[Wingstop]] is carryout. Why is that?

I think that’s how it’s always been at [[Wingstop]]. It was about bringing a meal home for the family. We’re seeing that trend expanding now with a lot of the big players opening up carryout and delivery only restaurants, instead of the dining room. I think we are going to see more and more. I own a couple of restaurants and, next door, there is a Burger King remodeling and they are going to just a double drive-thru with no dining room. They are bulldozing their building and creating a new one that has a much smaller footprint, that will have delivery and two drive-thrus. Covid pushed some of that. People weren’t going out and they started to get delivery. Once you sit on the couch and have your food brought to you, it’s hard to say, I’m going to get in the car and go and get it. I’ll pay that extra $3 or $4 to have someone bring it. That is where society is going.

### Management also mentioned that they are looking to move towards 100% digital orders. How do you think that could change the orders, per store?

When you order digitally, it takes care of a whole bunch of stuff. You’ve got the people’s names; you’ve got their credit card; you’ve got all this loyalty. I don’t know that it can ever go to 100% because I think you still want the people that are going to try you, who don’t have the app. If you go into Taco Bell and McDonald’s now, you don’t place your order; you go to a kiosk and it’s all digital. You don’t even have to run your credit card through now; you just tap on it. I ordered something this morning, on my phone, and I paid by Apple Pay so I didn’t even have to fill out the address; it just made it simple.

Who knows? Maybe with Apple Pay and things like that, everything will just be digital. That is part of the restaurant business that, maybe 10 years ago, did not have as high a place as now. I think the IT departments have moved greatly up the scale of importance at restaurants. It’s amazing what all of our devices can do and it’s a whole different area.

### There was one stat that really stood out to me in what management was sharing on the investor day which was that, in 2012, the AUV was $905,000; this year, it’s $1.6 million. That is a pretty huge change over nine years. They argue that some of it is fortressing; a higher density of stores builds a brand; better marketing penetration and so on. Part of it is, potentially, this shift to more digital orders, to get more orders per store. In your experience, how did you see the AUV change, in the early days, and what was actually really driving it?

We explained it by saying the stores got traction. How the stores started out we, at corporate, were not overly concerned. We watched the trend over the first 18 to 24 months and, usually, that 18-month mark was when things started taking off; towards the end of the second year, things would start growing. They haven’t actually really stopped. It’s incredible.

Getting back to that technology thing, most chains have an app you can order from on your phone, with your credit card. The technology for the delivery drivers means they have geofencing now. When the DoorDash or Uber driver is a mile from your place, then the order will print. The order doesn’t sit there; it is being freshly made. The technologies are built around ordering, delivering and having fresh, but where the guest doesn’t have to wait.

### Do you think [[Wingstop]] would ever do their own delivery, like Domino’s?

I think, at this point, with the labor challenges, it’s much simpler to have somebody come and pick it up and take it and just focus on doing what you do, inside the four walls of your restaurant.

### Given that it’s 75% carryout, that is only going to increase, with more people ordering online. Eventually, they could be the Domino’s for wings.

I just read an article yesterday. Kroger, one of the largest grocery store chains here in the United States, is opening in Florida, but they are not opening a grocery store; they are opening a delivery shed.

### Yes, with Ocado’s technology.

In the market to deliver groceries, they are seeing if they can penetrate into a state, without having any retail stores. How many of us don’t even think about going to the store anymore? We just pick up our phone, go on Amazon and it will be here tomorrow or the next day; in some cities, it might be there the same day.

### Did you ever try ghost kitchens, at [[Wingstop]]?

I think [[Wingstop]] has tried them, somewhere in California, but I don’t have any direct knowledge about that.

### They seem like the perfect concept for ghost kitchens; simple; only a fryer.

If you are operating a restaurant that is not operating to capacity, they are letting other businesses operate in their kitchen, for a share of the profits. How that is going to go, I don’t know, but if you have a marginal restaurant but you have a kitchen with fryers, you’re paying the rent and someone utilizes your fryers and is able to run another business out of the back door, that’s interesting too.

### I just want to finish off by talking about the franchisees and their returns. You’re a franchisee; I know you run other stores. Have you ever considered opening a [[Wingstop]] store?

I was talking to one of my partners, this last week, about the markets that we are doing business in, that there aren’t any Wingstops. We have actually discussed opening some Wingstops. I had an opportunity come up this past year to by some Rally’s fast food hamburger restaurants and I bought them. I was thinking about retiring, but I decided not to.

### You’re back in the game.

They keep pulling me back in.

### How do you compare the two? How do you look at Rally’s versus [[Wingstop]]?

Rally’s is more of a traditional hamburger restaurant with burgers, fries, chicken sandwiches; we have wings too. We have an across the board menu, which is a much more complex operation that [[Wingstop]]. But it can also be very lucrative concept as well. But we own the real estate on some of our spots so it’s a slightly different kind of investment.

In terms of the simplicity of [[Wingstop]] – 20 years after I was first associated with them – I’m still scratching my head as to how simple it is; how they’ve resisted adding burgers, shakes and fries. I’m impressed by that. I think if I had been king of [[Wingstop]], they may have added products that they didn’t need to do.

### Scott, just roughly, how do you forecast or estimate the unlevered returns you will get on a Rally’s versus what [[Wingstop]] could offer?

I bought some stores that had been open for 40 years, so I paid a multiple of cash flow; about four times cash flow. I think four to five times cash flow is probably an industry standard for buying a restaurant business. I found a unique situation with the Rally’s that I bought. As we get deeper into this, as I said, my partner and I have talked about maybe making a call to Dallas and seeing if they still like me and will let me do a [[Wingstop]] up here. I’m in the Northeast now; I used to be in Dallas.

### When we think about the franchisees and the approach they take, do they have to commit to a certain development pipeline?

I think so. I think you have to buy a three-store deal. I think that is now the minimum that they will do; I don’t think they will let you do one. They want you to grow and they want you to be a committed part of it. Sometimes, people just do one and, as things don’t work out, it’s easier to not fall through on your commitment.

### The other thing that stood out to me in what Charlie said, as well, was that there were a couple of stores – in Dallas, actually – that went from $1.5 million to $3.5 million in AUV, over a couple of years, by only adding two fryers to the same location.

That’s a very small investment. As we talked about that $1.5 million AUV, those $3.5 million stores are raising the boat for quite a handful of the $700,000 stores too. If you open up any kind of business, you have a risk of failure and a risk of success.

### So would you estimate that 20% or 30% of the stores are actually $700,000, $750,000?

You will have some on the high end, some on the low end and the majority of the stores, I would say, are probably in that $900,000 to $1.1 million, $1.2 million bracket. I don’t have access to that information; that’s just my speculation.

### What are the biggest operational challenges for franchisees, running the stores?

Right now, next to sourcing wings, I’m going to say that it’s staffing. Currently, it is a very challenging environment to staff restaurants. I’ve talked to a lot of other business owners and it’s not just a restaurant issue. The restaurant issue gets a lot of play but, right now, staffing is a big challenge in a lot of industries.

### That has always been the challenge for hospitality more broadly?

It’s about having good people. When mom was on the register, dad was cooking wings and number one son was cooking the fries, everybody had an interest. If you take those three people out and get three employees, some can be better than mom and dad were and some may be not as good. The labor part of it, the training and the crew is always a big challenge.

### I keep pulling up great stats because there are so many great stats around [[Wingstop]]. This last one was that there was a 1% closure rate, in the last five or six years, which seems incredible.

In my time there, very few closed. It was a big deal when one did because it was so rare; it was not a common occurrence. As I said, I believe most of the stores probably fall into that $800,000 to $1.2 million range where, if they’re not making a bunch of money, they’re not losing a bunch either.

### For those $800,000, $900,000 stores, is the capex the same or is it lower?

The guy that opens a $3 million store and the guy that opens a $500,000 store spend the same amount of money, for the most part. The rent might be different; the $3 million guy might be in a more desirable rent spot.

### Effectively, it’s pretty hard to lose money?

Yes; if you get your rent right and you know payments aren’t going to be too much on that $350,000, $400,000 loan that you got, the odds are that you are going to be okay. I would open a [[Wingstop]] today, and I might.
