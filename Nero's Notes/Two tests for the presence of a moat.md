The two tests for testing the presence of a [[Competitive Advantage]] are:
- Is the company very profitable? (ROIC, Margins) Significantly more profitable than its cost of capital?
- Is the company defending its market share over time? If the market share is declining, then the moat is not so strong. 

If these criteria are met, make sure to figure out what the competitive advantage is. It may well be that the high profitability is due to either operational efficiency or just that the company is the first mover in a new market. In this case, its profitability will erode quickly over time.
