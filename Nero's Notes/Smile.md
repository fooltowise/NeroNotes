## Ways to Smile More

Smiling is the natural response to something funny, happy, or enjoyable so it stands to reason that you probably do not need help with the automatic smile response. Where there is room for improvement is in those mundane, everyday situations when you otherwise might not be automatically smiling. To learn how to smile more, you must first practice:

1.  **Practice Smiling:** Smile. Do it right now as you read this. Put a big, warm smile on your face. Not a fake, strange smile, but a real smile, like you are seeing an old friend after several years. Now, think of something unhappy, but keep smiling. It is difficult to hold an unhappy or negative thought in your mind while keeping a smile on your face. Smiling can help increase happiness and decrease negativity.
2.  **Give Yourself a Smile Cue:** Now that you have practiced smiling and understand a little bit about how smiling can improve your mood, the trick is remembering to smile as you go through your day. You will probably need a reminder to smile often. Choose something that you hear, see, or do often during the day to be your “smile cue.” You might choose a sound as your reminder, like a phone ringing or an email notification beep. You might choose an action, such as getting in or out of your car, to remind you to smile. You might choose a visual reminder, like seeing someone drinking coffee or seeing someone laughing. Challenge yourself to smile every time you encounter your cues for this entire week.
4.  **Stay Motivated:** People who smile while talking make a much better impression because they seem more confident and friendly. You can even “hear” a smile over the phone. If you smile while taking a call, the tone of your voice will lighten and you’ll be able to make a better connection through the phone.

**Here's Your Commitment:** This week I will smile every time I am reminded by my “smile cue(s).”

## Tips for Smiling More

While steps one through three above provide everything you will need to challenge yourself to smile more, here are some other tips to help you:

-   Don’t look strange. Make your smiles natural, warm, and sincere. You are simply trying to maintain an elevated mood. Even just a small, almost unnoticeable smile can alter your mood.
-   Smile every time you think of it, not only when you encounter your smile cue.
-   [Think of something you really like](https://www.verywellmind.com/accentuate-the-positive-positive-thinking-and-happiness-2224115) when you smile — it will help make your smile sincere. Think of your favorite vacation spot, driving a brand new car, or a good friend.
-   Take a deep breath while you smile. This will help lessen any stress you have and give you a moment to enjoy your smile. A deep breath or two increases the relaxation and mood-enhancing the power of smiling.
-   Place notes and reminders of this skill throughout your world to remind you to smile more. Put a note on the phone, send yourself an email message, or make a note on your calendar. Make sure that you have plenty of reminders to smile more often. Eventually, it will become a habit (and one of your most healthy ones).
