# Genetics and Genome

- Life has usually two abilities:
    - the ability to replicate
    - the ability to create order. By this we mean that a living being usually takes energy from the outside in order to create the structures that keep it functioning (muscles, bones, cells). This process is often called metabolism.


***Anything that can use resources of the world to get copies of itself made is alive.***


- The human genome is the complete code that tells how to create a human being, make it evolve from an egg to a mature structure, and keep it functioning
- The genome contains 60'000 to 80'000 genes. A gene is a unit of heredity which is transferred from parent to offspring and is held to determine some characteristics of the offspring.
- If the human genome was a book, 
    - There would be 23 chapters called chromosomes
    - In each chromosomes there would be many stories, the genes
    - Each story (gene) is made up of paragraphs called _exons_ and interrupted by advertisement called _introns_
    - Each paragraph (exon) is made of words, called _codons_
    - Each word (codon) is made of letters called _bases_
    
- DNA is the molecular structure that contains the genome. There are only four different bases, A, G, C and T (adenine, guanine, cytosine and thymine). Each codon has a constant length of 3 bases. Example : AGC, AGG, etc

- DNA has the ability to duplicate and read(translate) itself:
    - **Duplication:** among the four bases, A likes to pair with T and G with C. The ADN double helix structure is such that if we separate it in two branches, one would be the mirror of the other, except that all the A's would be replaced by T's and G's by C's. If we want to recompose a double helix from the second branch, it is only possible if the new branch is exactly its complementary; in other words, an exact copy of the first branch.
    - **Translation** :
        - the gene starts by duplicating itself, but not in another DNA branch, but in another structure called RNA. RNA is similar to DNA in the sense that it has also four bases, three of them being identical to DNA (A,G,C) and it substitutes T for U (uracil).
        - The obtained RNA is called _messenger RNA_
        - Then a machine called a ribosome (itself made of RNA) will read the messenger RNA and from there build a chain of amino acid. Each codon is the synonym of an amino-acid. 
        - There are a total of 20 different amino acids, and since there are 64 different codons, some codons can be synonyms for the same amino acid.
        - The chain of amino-acids built by the ribosome is called a _protein_

Everything in the body is either made of proteins, or made by them. Every protein is translated in a gene (so DNA is the code of how to build all proteins in the body).
- in particular, most of the chemical reactions happening in the body are catalyzed by certain proteins known as _enzymes_. 
- even the process of reading/translating genes into proteins thanks to RNA is helped by proteins
- proteins are also responsible for switching certain genes on and off

**So genes and proteins are two sides of the same coin:**
- A protein is a way for a gene to make another gene
- A gene is a way for a protein to make another protein


Proteins represents chemistry, living, breathing, metabolism and behavior, what biologists call _phenotype_. DNA represents information, replication, breeding, sex, what biologists call _genotype_.

The first genes were not coded on DNA. DNA itself cannot reproduces itself without the help of a protein. In the same manner, the first genes did not come from a protein, as a protein does not have "instructions" on how to replicate.

It is way more likely that the first replicating structure was in fact RNA. The first living beings had their genes entirely coded on RNA branches. However RNA is unstable and decays after some hours. Once RNA was in place, DNA came as a stable evolution and life as we know it in the human body started to take place.

The first chromosome contains the gene 5S, which instructs how to assemble RNA and proteins into a ribosome, a machine whose job is to translate DNA recipes into proteins.


**The process of natural selection is one of extracting useful information from the environment and encoding it in the genes.** As such, there is a sense in which you can look on the human genome as four billion years worth of accumulated learning.
