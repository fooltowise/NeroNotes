# Barriers to Exit

Biological evolution works by [[Evolution - Natural Selection and Extinction| natural selection]], and so it is with the evolution of cooperation. Employment and anti-trust  concerns blunt the efficacy of this process, most notably via Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. It has been noted in the past how the imposition of exit barriers can lead to "survival of the unfittest". Likewise on a broader macroeconomic level, the low interest rate policy of the Federal Reserve - replacing an investment/tech bubble with a housing/credit bubble - has so far stymied many of the natural evolutionary forces.
