# Evolutionarily Stable Strategy

A strategy is a pre-programmed behavioral policy.  An example of strategy is :"Attack opponent; if he flees pursue him; if he retaliates run away." 

An evolutionarily stable strategy (or ESS) is defined as a strategy which, if most members of a population adopt it, cannot be bettered by an alternative strategy.
It is a subtle and important idea. Another way of putting it is to say that the best strategy for an individual depends on what the majority of the population are doing. Since the rest of the population consists of individuals, each one trying to maximize his own success, the only strategy that persists will be one which, once evolved, cannot be bettered by any deviant individual.

Following a major environmental change there may be a brief period of evolutionary instability, perhaps even oscillation in the population. But once an ESS is achieve it will stay: selection will penalize deviation from it.


### Hawks vs Doves
To apply this idea to aggression, consider one of John Maynard Smith's simplest hypothetical cases. 

Suppose that there are only two sorts of  fighting strategy in a population of a particular species, named *hawk* and *dove*. (The names refer to conventional human usage and have no connection with the habits of the birds from whom the names are derived - doves are in fact rather aggressive birds). 

Any individual of our hypothetical population is classified as a hawk or a dove. Hawks always fight as hard and unrestrainedly as they can, retreating only when seriously injured. Doves mainly threaten in a dignified conventional way, never hurting anybody. If a hawk fights a dove, the dove quickly run away, and so does not get hurt. If a hawk fights a hawk they go on until one of them is either seriously injured or dead. If a dove meets a dove nobody gets hurt; they go on posturing at each other for a long time until one of them tires or decides not to bother any more, and therefore backs down. For the time being, we assume that there is no way in which an individual can tell, in advance, whether a particular rival is a hawk or a dove. He only discovers this by fighting him, and he has no memory of past fights with particular individuals to guide him. 

Now as a purely arbitrary convention we allot contestants "points". Say 50 points for a win, 0 for losing, -100 for being seriously injured, and -10 for wasting time over a long contest. These points can be though of as being convertible directly into the currency of genes survival. An individual who scores high points, who has a high average payoff, is an individual who leaves many genes behind him in the gene pool. Within broad limits the actual numerical values do not matter for the analysis, but they help us to think about the problem.

The important thing is that we are *not* interested in whether hawks will tend to beat doves when they fight them. We already know the answer to that: hawks always win. We want to know whether either hawk or dove is an evolutionary stable strategy. If one of them is an ESS and the other is not, we must expect that the one which is an ESS will evolve. It is theoretically possible for there to be two ESSs. This would be true if, whatever the majority strategy of the population happens to be, whether hawk or dove, the best strategy for any given individual was to follow suit. In this case the population would tend to stick at whichever one of its two stable states it happened to reach first.

However, as we shall now see, neither of these two strategies, hawk or dove, would in fact be evolutionarily stable on its own, and we should therefore not expect either of them to evolve. To show this we must calculate average payoff.

Suppose we have a population consisting entirely of doves. Whenever they fight, nobody gets hurt. The contests consist  of prolonged ritual tournaments, staring matches perhaps, which end only when one rival backs down. The winner then scores 50 points for gaining the resource in dispute, but he pays a penalty of -10 for wasting time over a long staring match, so scores 40 in all. The loser also is penalized -10 for wasting time. On average, any one individual dove can expect to win half his contests and lose half. Therefore his average payoff per contest is the average of +40 and -10m which is +15. Therefore, every individual dove in a population of doves seems to be doing quite nicely.

But now suppose a mutant hawk arises in the population. Since he is the only hawk around, every fight he has is against a dove. Hawks always beat doves, so he scores +50 every fight, and this is his average payoff. He enjoys an enormous advantage over the doves, whose net payoff is only +15. Hawk genes will rapidly spread through the population as a result. But now each hawk can no longer count on every rival he meets being a dove. To take an extreme example, if the hawk gene spread so successfully that the entire population consists of hawks, all fights would now be hawks fights. Things are now very different.  When hawk meets hawk, one of them is seriously injured, scoring -100, while the winner  scores +50. Each hawk in a population of hawks can expect to win half his fights and lose half his fights. His average expected payoff per fight is therefore halfway between +50 and -100, which is -25. 

Now consider a single dove in a population of hawks. To be sure, he loses all his fights, but on the other hand he never gets hurt. His average payoff is 0 in a population of hawks, whereas the average payoff for a hawk in a population of hawks is -25. Dove genes will therefore tend to spread through the population.


The way I have told the story it looks as if there will be a continuous oscillation in the population. Hawk genes will sweep to ascendancy; then, as a consequence of the hawk majority, dove genes will gain an advantage and increase in numbers until once again hawk genes start to prosper, and so on. However, it need not be an oscillation like this. There is a stable ratio of hawks to doves. For the particular arbitrary points system we are using, the stable ratio, if you work it out, turns out to be 5/12 doves to 7/12 hawks. When this stable ratio is reached, the average payoff for hawks is exactly the same as the average payoff for doves. Therefore selection does not favour either one of them over the other. If the number of hawks in the population started to drift upwards so that the ratio was no longer 7/12, doves would start to gain an extra advantage, and the ratio would swing back to the stable state. Just as we shall find the stable sex ratio to be 50:50,  so the stable hawk to dove ratio in this hypothetical example is 7:5. In either case, if there are oscillations about the stable point, they need not be very large ones.


Superficially, this sounds a little like group selection, but it is really nothing of the kind. It sounds like group selection because it enables us to think of a population as having a stable equilibrium to which it tends to return when disturbed. But the ESS is a much more subtle concept than group selection. It has nothing to do with some groups being more successful than others. 

This can be nicely illustrated using the arbitrary point system of our hypothetical example.The average payoff to an individual in a stable population consisting of 7/12 hawks and 5/12 doves turns out to be 6 1/4. This is true whether the individual is a hawk or a dove. Now 6 1/4 is much less than the average payoff of a dove in a population of doves (+15). 

If *only* everybody would agree to be a dove, every single individual would benefit. By simple group selection, any group in which all individuals mutually agree to be doves would be far more successful than a rival group sitting at the ESS ratio. As a matter of fact, a conspiracy of nothing but doves is not quite the most successful possible group. In a group consisting of 1/6 hawks and 5/6 doves, the average payoff per contest is 16 2/3. This is the most successful possible conspiracy, but for present purpose we can ignore it. A simpler all-dove conspiracy, with  its average payoff for each individual of 15, is far better for every single individual than the ESS would be. 

Group selection theory would therefore predict a tendency to evolve towards an all dove conspiracy, since a group that contained a 7/12 proportion of hawks  would be less successful.  But the trouble with conspiracies, even those that are to everybody's advantage in the long run, is that they are open to abuse. It is true that everybody does better in an all-dove  group than in a ESS group. But unfortunately, in conspiracies of doves, a single hawk does so extremely well that nothing could stop the evolution of hawks. the conspiracy is therefore bound to be broken by treachery from within. 

An ESS is stable, not because it is particularly good for the individuals participating in it, but simply because it is immune to treachery from within.

It is possible for humans to enter into pacts or conspiracies that are to every individual's advantage, even if these are not stable in the ESS sense. But this is only possible because every individual uses his *conscious* foresight, and is able to see that it is in his own long-tern interests to obey the rules of the pact. Even in human pacts there is a constant danger  that individuals will stand to gain so much in the *short term*  by breaking the pact that the temptation to do so will be overwhelming. 

Perhaps the best example of this is price-fixing. It is in the long-term interests of all individual garage owners to standardize the price of petrol at some artificially high value. Price rings, based on conscious estimation of long-term best interests, can survive for quite long periods. Every so often, however, an individual gives in to the temptation to make a quick killing by cutting his prices. Immediately, his neighbors follow suit, and a wave of price cutting spreads over the country. Unfortunately for the rest of us, the conscious foresight of the garage owners then reasserts itself, and they enter into a new price-fixing pact. 

So, even in man, a species with the gift of conscious foresight, pacts or conspiracies based on long-term best interests teeter constantly on the brink of collapse due to treachery from within. In wild animals, controlled by struggling genes, it is even more difficult to see ways in which group benefit or conspiracy strategies could possibly evolve. We must expect to find evolutionarily stable strategies everywhere.
