# Policy Resistance

## Description:
Occurs when several actors try to pull each the stock level of a system toward a different goal. Any new policy, especially if it is efficient, pulls the stock even further from the objectives of each actor and produces additional resistance. Nobody likes the result, but everybody expands considerable efforts to maintain it.

## Solution:

Let go. Gather every stakeholders and use the energy formerly spent to find a solution mutually satisfying for every goal, or to redefine bigger and more important goals that assembles everybody.
