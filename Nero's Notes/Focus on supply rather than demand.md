# Focus on Supply rather than Demand

Given that the future is uncertain, it is surprising to see that  most investors spend the bulk of their time trying to forecast future demand for the companies they follow. 

The aviation analyst will try to answer the question: How many long-haul flights will be taken in 2020? A global auto strategist will attempt to forecast China's demand  for passenger cars 15 years hence.

No one knows the answers to these questions. Long range demand projections are likely to result in large forecasting errors.

[[Capital Cycle Analysis]] however focuses on supply rather than demand. Supply prospects are far less uncertain than demand, and thus easier to forecast. In fact, increases in an industry's aggregate supply are often well flagged and come with varying lags - depending on the industry in question - after the changes in the industry's capital spending.  In certain industries, such as aircraft manufacturing and shipbuilding, the supply pipelines are well-known. 

Because most investors and corporate managers spend more of their time thinking about demand conditions in an industry than changing supply, stock prices often fail to anticipate negative supply shocks.
