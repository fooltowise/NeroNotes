# The Insurance Industry

The insurance industry doesn't need extensive introduction. Practically everyone is a customer, and most are disgruntled (too expensive, overly bureaucratic, frequently deny claims). But this is just the not-so-pretty face of your insurance company. Most, except for experts, know next to nothing about the business of insurance. If corporate financial reports are generally opaque, insurance companies' reports are outright incomprehensible. We will clear the mist, focusing on the crucial information for investors.

## Sector synopsis

The insurance industry is classified into three segments: *property and casualty* (PC) - damage or loss to cars, homes, or businesses; *life and health* (LH) - life and health insurance; and *reinsurance* - entities selling insurance to insurance companies, relieving the latter (ceding companies) from some or all of their risk. We will focus in this case study on the first segment - property and casualty (PC) companies - which is the largest segment of the industry in terms of number of companies and customers. 

These entities profit from underwriting (selling) insurance to customers, and given the generally long time between receipt of premium from customers and payment of claims, they also gain from investing the substantial funds they accumulate (about 65 percent of insurers' total assets, mostly invested in fixed income securities). These investments provide a major source of income for insurance companies, often surpassing the insurance income.

The PC business risk is high relative to other insurance segments, particularly due to catastrophic risks (earthquakes, terrorism, floods, asbestos claims). That's where reinsurance comes handy. The industry is regulated in the United States at the state level, including regulation of insurance prices. Competition, particularly in the consumer segment of the business is fierce, evidenced by the substantial amount spent by insurance companies on advertising (Geico's gecko, Progressive's Flo). There are several large but not dominant firms in the industry (State Farm, Geico, Allstate). Insurers face two major issues: in the economists's parlance, adverse selection and moral hazard. The former refers to the tendency of individuals or companies with high risk (e.g., seriously ill people) to obtain more coverage than low-risk persons, and the latter refers to the tendency of the insured to engage in riskier behavior (neglect house maintenance) relative to the uninsured, and, at the extreme, to fake claims. Both of these hazards are mitigated by smart customer management, as you'll see shortly. The industry as a whole is quite profitable, as indicated by the S&P Insurance Select Industry Index, which slightly lagged the S&P 500 over the 10-year period 2006-2015 (7.84 percent vs. 9.14 percent, average annual return), yet edged the S&P 500 in the latter five years (15.37 percent vs 13.11 percent average annual return).

Investors in insurance companies, as in other sectors, focus on the company's strategy to create value and growth, and the execution of the strategy. This was made clear in the 2012-2013 conference calls of the 10  insurance companies we studied in detail. For example, in Progressive's 2013 investor meeting (May 16, 2013), both the CEO and CFO presentations were fully devoted to the company's strategy and business model, elaboration on the primary objective of management (to grow as fast as possible, subject to 96 percent or less "combined ratio" - expenses over over revenues), and the extent to which this objective was achieved. Analysts' questions were similarly strategy-focused in Progressive's calls, as in the other calls we studied. Financial report (accounting) information plays a limited role in such strategic analysis because it is virtually silent about the main factors that matter: strategic assets and their development (customers, in particular), the fundamental drivers of the value created (like changes in insurance rate, or the frequency and severity of insurance claims), and the company's strategy to manage risk and preserve the strategic assets. Fragments of the strategic information are presented in management's voluminous discussions accompanying the financial reports (MD&A, for example), but they are often buried in hopelessly long-winded and frankly boring statements (Allstate's 2013 report to shareholders is a tome of 294 dense pages). The information is incomplete (some companies provide information on policy renewals, or churn, while others don't), and the measures reported are not standardized and comparable across competitors. This creates the acute need for our compact and standardized Resources & Consequences Report.

## It all starts with strategic assets

These assets are the drivers of corporate value and sustained competitive advantage: To recap, they generate a stream of net benefits, they are rare (the pool of low risk, loyal customers is limited), and they cannot be easily imitated by competitors (Geico's leading brand cannot readily be recreated by a newcomer). For insurance companies, *customers* are the most valuable strategic asset, as noted by Peter Drucker, the management guru who said that the aim of a business is to create a customer. Much of insurance companies' strategy and operational success revolves around customer management: acquiring the *right* customers, not just any customers, and convincing them to stay with the company (renew policies). Information about customer management - totally absent from financial reports - is thus key for investors to assess company performance and chart its future growth. Other strategic assets are brands (Allstate's Esurance), intellectual property (patents on new products, like Snapshot, Progressive's plugged-in-the-car device to track individual driving behavior and offer customized premiums), and dedicated, productive agents. Back to customers.

What are the "right" customers assuring sustained competitive advantage? These are persons with low adverse selection and moral hazard (defined earlier), namely, low-risk (safe driers), and careful (property maintaining) customers. Successful strategy (referred to as book management) is aimed at targeting such customers (Hartford, for example, teamed up with AARP, the dominant retirees association, to market insurance to AARP members - older people are, on average, conscientious, low-mileage drivers, carefully maintaining their cars), and holding on to them as long as possible with attractive rates and good customer relations (claims management). Keeping a high-quality "book" is of the essence. Insurance companies change rates (premiums) frequently - the industry is known to regularly experience competition-driven *underwriting cycles*, where rates and profits rise and fall. Rate decreases draw both good and bad customers, and successful customer management quickly weeds out the latter during successive policy renewal cycles. 

The basic tension, or balancing act of customer (book) management is to healthily grow the company - add customers - at relatively low customer acquisition costs (advertising, agent commissions), then hold on to the good customers, and maintain low operating costs (few and inexpensive claims). Regrettably for investors, the quarterly/annual earnings of insurance companies often portray a distorted picture of customer management, particularly in the peaks and trough of underwriting cycles. For example, when a company decreases rates to enhance growth, reported earnings will often be depressed, or even negative, because of the low new premiums and losses from poor (high claims) customers attracted to the low rates. But these low earnings don't necessarily indicate management failure. It takes time to stabilize the book and reap the benefits of the policy change. 

Insurance companies' reported earnings are also distorted by poor expense-revenue matching: Reported earnings often include adjustments made to prior-year reserves (estimates of future claims) without corresponding revenues, and the main expense item - insurance losses (current and expected payments to customers) - is subject to considerable uncertainty due to the long time lag between insured events (car accident, work injury) and the final settlement of claims, which may take years. The large component of *estimated* future payments on claims in the insurance losses item renders the reported earnings of insurance companies less certain and more volatile than the earnings of companies in most other sectors. This, of course, reflects the nature of the insurance business (long-tail claims), and in fairness, PC companies provide substantial information about estimated future payments. Nevertheless, insurance companies' reported earnings are not the most reliable indicators  of enterprise performance and growth potential. Enter the customers segment of the Resource & Consequences Report.

## The Resource & Consequences Report - Customers

Figure 13.1 is the “customers box” in our proposed insurance companies’ Resources & Consequences Report. The numbers in the box, for demonstration purposes, are for Allstate Corp., from left to right: first quarter 2013, first quarter 2012 (year-earlier quarter), and the percentage change.

Allstate is a large and mature company, so don’t expect big year-to-year changes. The data on policies-in-force—a measure of customer size—indicate a slight decrease in the number of policies (0.7 percent) over the 12 months examined, but the line below reveals that, nevertheless, there was a 2.5 percent increase in total written premium. The resolution to this seeming contradiction (lower policies-in-force, but higher written premium) is found in the third item in the box: rising average premium written, which increased over the 12 months by 2.2 percent for auto and 4.7 percent for homes. Thus, an across-the-board rise in Allstate’s insurance rates, rather than in number of effective policies (customer size), led to the modest (2.5 percent) increased revenues (written premium).

**Policies in Force (000)**
- 32'831; 33'062; -0.7%

**Written Premium ($M)**
- 6'625; 6'463; 2.5%

**Average Premium Written ($)**
- Auto: 462; 452; 2.2%
- Home: 1'115; 1'065; 4.7%

**New Policies (000)**
- Auto: 570; 542; 5.2%
- Home: 87.0; 87.4; -0.5%

A rise in “combined ratio”—the ratio of expenses (the sum of claims payments and operating expenses) to revenues—generally triggers rate increases as a company seeks to maintain profitability. (Progressive, for example, responded in 2012 to a combined ratio increase by upping auto rates by 6.5–10 percent.) The downside of a rate increase is, of course, customer defection. But Allstate’s renewal (retention) rate data, at the bottom of the box, lays this concern to rest for auto: renewals increased by 0.8 percent. However, the larger (4.7 percent) rate increase for homes apparently trigged a negative effect: home renewals decreased by 0.5 percent. Overall, Allstate managed to drive in the quarter a modest car rate increase, improving the top line somewhat, without a significant customer defection, but the higher homeowners rate increase adversely affected the customer base. Obviously, Allstate’s rate-increasing policy margins are razor thin. We don’t know, of course, how many potential customers were deterred by the higher rates, but the data on “new policies” for the quarter (see box) are encouraging: 5.2 percent increase for auto and a substantial 11.9 percent for homes. Intriguingly, Allstate increased new homeowner policies in the quarter, but also lost more customers (effective advertising?).

So, where will growth come from? Allstate’s management points at Esurance, the online insurance segment of the company, a pioneer in the industry. Esurance’s written premium growth was a healthy 30.5 percent in the quarter, albeit from a relatively small base. But this growth faces a stiff headwind: Customer acquisition costs in Esurance (mainly advertising) is high, still rendering the segment a “loss leader,” and competitors are quickly catching up with their own online insurance offerings. This clearly demonstrates the need to sustain innovation to maintain growth.

**INVESTOR’S INSIGHTS**

Considering Allstate’s customers franchise, the concern is that there was no volume (policies-in-force) growth during 2012, and that the meagre top line (revenue) growth (2.5 percent) came from rate increases. In the very price-competitive PC industry, increasing rates isn’t a winning, sustainable strategy. Much of the competition is about offering lower rates and customer savings (“15 minutes will save you 15 percent,” says Geico’s catchy slogan), compensated by enhanced operational efficiency. Indeed, answering analysts’ questions in the 2013 earnings call, Allstate’s management announced a slowdown of the rate increase. Growth is obviously a concern for Allstate, as well as for most other large insurers.

## New products - Innovation

Most industries generate growth by penetrating new markets as they innovate with new products or services, create new demand (e.g., handheld devices, cosmetic drugs), or poach from competitors. However, foreign markets are not an option for most insurance companies, and competitors quickly imitate innovations in financial services, including in the PC insurance marketplace. Such was, for example, the case of the device plugged into cars to track drivers’ habits and adjust insurance rates accordingly. Progressive has its Snapshot, personalizing each driver’s policy after 30 days. The company even has six patents on it, but that didn’t deter Hartford from developing its own in-car device, “True Lane,” or Allstate from its “Drive Wise” car device, which it claims resulted in average premium reduction of 14 percent. The future lies, say PC managers, in telematics devices that will enable ongoing, two-way communication with drivers to improve their driving behavior.

Other innovations include comparative raters, allowing agents and customers to compare the company’s rates with competitors’, and “mobile quoting,” enabling customers to get insurance quotes on handheld devices. Progressive claims that mobile quotes increased 8 percent in 2013. Service centers, where customers can interact directly with company representatives, are also a recent innovation. Innovation in the form of new services provides an important, albeit relatively short-lived, competitive edge for targeting the roughly 10–15 percent of customers who switch companies every year, as well as attracting new customers. Obviously, an insurance company must quickly keep up with the leading innovators, which Allstate is clearly doing. Accordingly, information about company innovation and its effects (e.g., new business from service centers) should be provided in the New Products box of the Resource Development column of the Resources & Consequences Report (at chapter end). This will help investors assess the sustainability of the company’s competitive advantage.

## Agents - Still Important

Although direct (online, phone, mail) insurance sales are increasing, the traditional agent channel still generates considerable business. There are two types of agents: dedicated and independent; the former work with one company only, while the latter offer customers a menu of insurance solutions. Dedicated agents are obviously a strategic resource (see Agencies box at end of chapter Report), and details on the number of agents, their productivity (agent-driven new and in-force policies), the quality of the customers they generate (e.g., average losses on agents’ customers relative to the company’s other customers), and the commissions paid to agents, are important information items to evaluate the company’s agency strategy. In its conference calls, Allstate managers touched on agencies, but rather obliquely.

They, for example, mentioned changes made in 2012 to agents’ incentives and bonuses, without data, saying that the incentive changes led to a certain decrease in the number of agents. Not much to go by, but other companies disclosed even less. Obviously poor disclosure, but the generally meek analysts in the calls didn’t press executives for improved transparency. It is hard to see any competitive threats from disclosing information that enables investors to assess the performance of insurance agencies.

Overall, given the relatively small market slice over which all companies compete (about 10 to 15 percent of the insured, as well as new customers), and the similarly small margins for rate decreases (for most companies, insurance costs already exceed 90 percent of revenues), investors can’t expect dramatic top-line (revenue) changes for medium and large companies. Smaller, local companies, exploiting niches, and new entrants to the industry can grow, of course, at a faster rate.

Operational efficiency (effective claims management, information technology) can also generate bottom-line growth and serve as a major source of value creation and competitive advantage. Such operational efficiency, to which we now turn, is mainly generated by the company’s “organization capital,” namely, the systems, processes, methods, and knowledge employed by the enterprise to perform its assigned tasks in the most efficient way.

## Operations - Resource Deployment

Property and casualty insurance operations are quite complex, involving the acquisition of new customers, maintaining the quality of the “book,” and handling customers’ claims in the least painful way for the insured, all while economizing on the company’s resources, maintaining and developing the company’s brand, managing risk—how much of the company’s exposure to cede to reinsurers, and other risk management techniques—incentivizing employees and agents, and running the huge back-office operations smoothly. This is a mouthful of activities and a serious challenge for managers. Running a tight ship significantly affects the value created and allows the company to reduce rates and stay competitive, and we accordingly devote special attention to this issue. By all accounts, Geico, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, is the best-run major US insurance company.

In the insurance sector, financial report information on operating efficiency suffers from the usual accounting deficiencies, but it is magnified for PC insurers by the unusually large proportion of expenses made up by estimates of future claim payments (loss reserve), and the frequent adjustments of previous-years’ loss reserves, included in current expenses, all increasing the uncertainty of reported earnings and decreasing the revenue−expense matching. Absent from financial reports are insights into the fundamental causes of expense changes, impeding investors’ assessment of the operational efficiency of the company’s organization capital. Needed is a system that relies less on subjective managerial estimates and forecasts, sometimes “managed” by executives, and more on verifiable facts. Such a system, part of the Resources & Consequences Report, is presented in Figure 13.2 (numbers are for Allstate, first quarters 2013 and 2012).

**Claim Expenses ($M)**
- 4'460; 4'339; 2.8%

**Claim Frequency**
- Body : -1.9%; -2.5%
- Property: -0.4%; -4.3%

**Severity**
- Body: 7.4%; 1.2%
- Property: -1.0%; 4.6%

**Operating Expenses ($M)**
1'102; 1'017; 8.4%
- Information Technology
- Advertising
- Agents' commissions
- Back Office

**Resources Investments ($M) (undisclosed values)**
- Brands
- Systems
- Intellectual Property

**Written Premiums ($M)**
6'625; 6'163; 2.5%

**Gross Margin Ratio**

16.0%; 16.7%



The Operations box in Figure 13.2 focuses on three inputs that support the companies’ output (revenue, written, or earned): Claims expenses, that is, payments on customers’ claims, by far the largest expense item; operating expenses, namely, the cost of running the business; and the periodic investments in strategic resources—brands, IT, and intellectual property, which accountants lump with regular operating expenses in the income statement. These three inputs support (indicated by arrows) the revenues (written premiums) at the bottom of the box, leading to the gross margin (revenues minus claims and operating expenses) and the gross margin ratio—the “bot- tom line” of the firm’s operations.

We are limited in demonstrating the full potential of the proposed operations analysis, because the expense data in PC companies’ income statements mix regular expenses and investments and often don’t provide separate information on key expenses (IT, advertising), and are, therefore, inadequate for an in-depth operating analysis. In a real-life Resources & Consequences Report, information would be provided on claims expenses, excluding changes in estimates of prior year reserves, and the reserve for future claims will be discounted, or at least separated from the actual payments on claims, and the main operating expenses, such as advertising and IT, would be split between current expenses and investments (generating future benefits). For example, Allstate’s advertising campaign during the first few years of its online Esurance service was obviously an investment in the brand rather than a regular expense. Only current operating expenses, along with claims expenses, should determine the gross margin and be used for assessment of enterprise cost control. Resource investments (right-hand box) should be analyzed separately, relating them to consequent benefits (e.g., effectiveness of an advertising campaign by the consequent business).

## Penetrating the costs black box

The reported total claims expenses (top left box in Figure 13.2)—$4,460 million and $4,339 million, respectively, a 2.8 percent increase—don’t really tell us much about the dynamics of this major expense item of PC insurers. What were the main determinants of the claims, and what do the num- bers say about the management of the customers’ “book”? The breakdown of claims determinants to accidents’ frequency and severity, provided by a few insurers only, is revealing. Claim frequency—which is affected by vehicle technology, road safety, and drivers’ competence and attention (texting while driving) for auto insurance, and the quality of building materials for homes insurance—slightly decreased at Allstate in the first quarter: –1.9 percent for body and –0.4 percent for property, continuing Allstate’s 2012 frequency downward trend. In contrast, severity—the amount of claimed damage—jumped for the more serious bodily damage by 7.4 percent in the first quarter of 2013, a significant uptick.12 Of concern, Allstate’s call presentations show a constant increase in body severity growth dating back to 2011: The severity increases in the last three quarters of 2012 were 3.4 per- cent, 6.8 percent, and 5.2 percent. This obviously should be disconcerting to investors—particularly the negative trend—because body (injury, death) claims are the heaviest cost driver of total claims.

Over time, the inflation of medical costs affects severity, but this cannot fully explain Allstate’s fast 2011−2013 growth. In the earnings call, management didn’t elaborate on the severity growth—no one asked about it, a sad commentary on analysts’ acumen—but the severity growth may indicate a deterioration in the quality of the customers’ book. High-risk, careless drivers committing serious accidents aren’t being winnowed by the company, and the quality of the book deteriorates. Perhaps, this is an unintended con- sequence of the sharp growth (30.5 percent) of Allstate’s online customers (Esurance).

***Proof of concept***: Do investors actually need information on claims frequency and severity, as we argue? To prove they do, we collected quarterly data on frequency and severity for 10 companies that provided this information, over the four years 2010–2013. We then regressed (correlated) the quarterly stock returns of these companies on their earnings growth (relative to same quarter a year earlier)—a stock return driver—and the changes in accidents’ frequency and severity during the quarter. The regression coefficient estimates of frequency and severity were statistically significant (at the 2–3 percent level), confirming that changes in these two non-accounting indicators indeed affect stock prices—namely, they are relevant to investors.

**INVESTOR’S INSIGHT**

Note how GAAP’s focus on total claim payments obscures underly- ing serious developments that should be aired out with management. Allstate’s reported total claims inched up during the quarter by 2.8 percent, barely higher than the 2012 inflation rate (2.1 percent), a seemingly innocuous cost rise. Digging deeper, however, shows that a major cost driver—body severity—continued, and even accelerated its rising trend. Management should provide reasons, along with what it is doing to reverse the trend. Allstate, to its credit, voluntarily provided consistent frequency and severity data, which cannot be said about most other insurers we have examined. Investors should obviously demand this information.

We wish we could have analyzed in similar depth the remaining two boxes: operating expenses (which “healthily” grew 8.4 percent) and investments, but we couldn’t find the required details in Allstate’s, or any other company’s reports. The “big costs” of PC insurers requiring close scrutiny are advertising and IT. In the earnings call (Q1–2013), Progressive executives mentioned that advertising costs were up 15 percent annually for the past 15 years (obvious to everyone who watches Flo with her shticks on TV). But what’s important for a strategic cost–benefit analysis are the cor- responding performance measures (benefits). For example, do Progressive’s 15 percent annual advertising hikes generate similar increases in requests for quotes by potential customers? We know from Progressive’s reports that year-on-year revenue growth was about half the advertising growth rate. Did Progressive’s advertising reach the stage of diminishing marginal returns? Should the advertising increases slow down, perhaps? Or, for Allstate’s Esurance, which is also advertised heavily, it would be instructive to correlate the advertising growth with the number of views of the Esurance site, and the rate of conversion (viewers turned to customers). Perhaps Esurance, too, passed the point of increasing marginal returns and the advertising expenses should slow down. Similarly with agents—their costs should correlate positively with the amount of business they generate. Investors should demand this, and similar strategic information from management to properly evaluate operational efficiency. Financial report totals—Allstate’s 8.4 percent operating expense increase—are, at best, a starting point for a serious analysis. The Resources & Consequences Report, accordingly, calls for substantially more insightful cost disclosure.

The right-hand side of the Operations box exhibited in Figure 13.2 focuses on investments, in contrast with operating expenses. Insurance companies aren’t radical innovators, like pharma or software companies, but they invest substantial amounts in their organization capital, namely in business systems and processes enabling an efficient use of company resources. It’s therefore important to focus on brands, IT, and human resource (train- ing) investments, as well as on innovations (plug-in car devices to customize the driving experience, or online claim resolution) to gauge the company’s investment rate in future growth. Regrettably, we cannot provide examples of such analysis and inferences because none of the ten companies we have examined in depth provided relevant information on strategic investments.

Concluding the resource deployment (operations) analysis, a cost− benefit comparison is made at the bottom of the box, deriving the gross margin ratio (ratio of the difference between premiums and expenses to premiums), yielding for Allstate a year-to-year slight decrease of gross margin from 16.7 percent in the first quarter of 2012 to 16.0 percent in the first quarter of 2013. This is not alarming, but an issue for investors to watch for.

## Resource Preservation

This part of the Resources & Consequences Report is particularly relevant for insurance companies, where the main thrust of resource preservation is managing the risk of the franchise and maintaining a high quality of the book (customers): winnowing high-risk customers and preventing competitors from poaching quality customers. We have discussed customer management, so let’s turn to risk. By its nature, insurance is a risky business:

An insurer buys risk from the insured, literally “sitting” on pools of risks, and managing this pool is a prime activity directly affecting the company’s value created and competitive advantage.

Three types of risks affect insurance operations:

1.  ***Underwriting risk*** is the risk that the premiums collected from customers will fall short of the claim payments to them. This risk is particularly high, since the extent of large liabilities, like asbestos or pollution liability cases is not known at the time the policies are written. Those catastrophic claims can easily mushroom into billions of dollars (the 2012 Hurricane Sandy claims). Underwriting risk rises when competition among insurers intensifies and companies react by lowering rates, thereby attracting low-quality, high-risk customers, among others.

2.  ***Investment risk*** is the risk related to stocks and bonds price fluctuations. Since insurance companies maintain large investments in securities and rely on investment income to fill their coffers, they are subject to the risks of investing in capital markets, such as the impact of unexpected interest rate changes on bond prices, default of borrowers, or adverse changes in stock prices.

3.  ***Regulatory risk*** results from regulators’ power to deny or constrain rate increases, to force insurers to cover certain risks they wouldn’t have covered otherwise (earthquake or flood damage), or change capital requirements and other solvency-related regulations.

Insurance companies use multiple risk management tools to manage and
contain their underwriting risk exposure, particularly potential losses from catastrophic events. These strategies include offering policies that limit the insurer’s risk exposure ($1 million max umbrella liability insurance), diversifying exposure across geographic areas and industries, sharing risk with other companies (underwriting pools), or issuing to the public catastrophe bonds (cat bonds), which, in case of a catastrophic event, allow the insurance company to retain the bond principle. Reinsurance, however, is the major means of risk management, where part or all of the risk of an insurance portfolio is transferred to a reinsurance company for a portion of the premium received from customers. Some reinsurance contracts involve an “excess-of-loss” clause, where the reinsurance kicks in when the company’s loss exceeds a predetermined limit.

Traditional tools of investment risk diversification come into play when managing the risk of the investment portfolio: avoiding high-risk investments (junk bonds), using financial derivatives (hedging), and invest- ing in insured bonds (most of insurance companies’ investments are in fixed-income securities). Finally, regulatory risk is largely managed through lobbying the regulators and legislators.


The Resource Preservation part of the Resources & Consequences Report (mid-column) should accordingly provide sufficient information enabling investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s risk management, and the extent of risk exposure. Narrative, but not boilerplate, discussion of management’s risk mitigation strategies, with quantitative indicators, like proportion of exposure and premium ceded to reinsurers, along with traditional risk measures, such as VAR (value at risk) should be provided in the Resources & Consequences Report. As for regulatory risk, relevant information includes the status of major rate increase applications and regulators’ moves to impose new coverage on the company.

Here, as elsewhere, it’s important to perceive the proposed Report as an integrated system, rather than a list of disparate indicators. Accordingly, other information in the Report, particularly on patterns in the frequency and severity of claims and customer’s rate of renewing policies, also shed light on important insurance risk dimensions. A pattern of increasing claims’ severity, for example, indicates an increase in underwriting risk. From analysts’ questions in the conference calls we studied, it is clear that investors have a keen interest in insurance risk issues, and yet we didn’t see any systematic and relevant (non-boilerplate) risk disclosure by the companies, and the answers to analysts’ questions were patchy at best—a missed opportunity to inform investors. That’s where the potential of our Resources & Consequences Report is manifested: in organizing and standardizing an integrated investor-relevant information system.

## Value Created

Insurance companies’ reported earnings and cash flows seem quite hefty. All- state’s 2014 net income was $2.85 billion, 8.1 percent of total revenues, and cash from operations were $3.24 billion. However, these earnings abstract from the cost of equity capital—a necessary cost of doing business—and given the relatively large equity (book value) of insurance companies, their real profits are, in fact, substantially lower than reported. For example, All- state’s average book equity during 2014 was $22 billion. The company’s systematic risk is relatively low, due to the size and stability of its operations (beta value of 0.81), so an 8 percent cost of capital seems appropriate. This yields an annual cost of equity capital of $1.76 billion ($22B × 0.08), leaving a 2014 value created of $1.48 billion (3.24 - 1.76), or about 5 percent of market value (around $30 billion). This is a reasonable value creation for a large and mature insurance company.

We conclude the property and casualty insurance analysis with a schematic, comprehensive Resources & Consequences Report (Figure 13.3).
