# Harris Podcast with Mark Leonard - Transcript


**Jeff Bender :**  Hello and welcome everyone to our latest experiment, the Harris podcast. my name is Jeff Bender and I'm here to help you better understand who we are, where we are going, and to engage you on our journey. These podcasts are intended to introduce you to our leaders, our initiatives, and to new ideas and ways of thinking. Our goal is to not only inform you but to engage you in helping us create an enduring organization. Please Enjoy.

On this podcast I'll be speaking with Mark Leonard, founder, president and chairman of Constellation Software, our parent company. Mark founded Constellation in 1995, 25 years ago, using a less than memorable initial name in this business case and pitch, referring to it simply as *Software [unaudible]*. Over this 25 years period, Constellation has invested in over 500 businesses, now has more than 3 billion dollars in net revenues, and more than 25'000 employees worldwide. CSI is currently organized in six operating groups, Harris being one of them.

I've been fortunate to work with Mark for over 20 years, watching him reinvent himself, to genuinely challenge me to become a better investor, an owner of the businesses we bought. Please join Mark and I, as we learn to know him a little bit better and understand how he thinks about our two areas of focus, being disciplined deployers of capital, and great owners of VMS businesses. Mark, welcome to the podcast.

**Mark Leonard :** Thank you Jeff, looking forward to it.

**Jeff Bender :** To start with, which I think is an area you don't typically talk a lot about, but if you were from Harris I would typically use my three-kids or my wife to illustrate a point or to make a point. Would you mind sharing with us what your family situation is and what your kids are up to?

**Mark Leonard :** - laughing - Family situation, wow. My wife and I met in business school, she's French Canadian, she's the nicest human being that I know. Everyone adores her. She's kind and thoughtful and goes out of her way. Really I would not have achieved anywhere near what I've achieved without support and her taking care of the family. As you mentioned I have four kids, they are in their early 30s to mid 30s now, we get along well and visiting a couple of them right now out on the West Coast. One thing I am kind of surprised is at how open people are about themselves and their families in this Internet age, because nothing ever disappears.

I learned early when I was in the venture business that whatever you say to thirdparties tends to get used in whatever way they wish to use it. When I was in the venture business I had a bad experience with the press, and that really put me off talking with them, and made me very careful about what information about companies we shared. We were very careful to create full messages, but even then we recognize that  you deliver full messages which means that the journalist does not have to work particularly hard and they can just take the whole thing, lock, stock and barrel and use it and move on, you get a good chance of getting that full message through. But if what they do is trying to be sensational, they will pick and choose and mis-use whatever you delivered to them. And that kind of irresponsible use strikes me as the norm.

And I find, even when I look at Internet chat groups of various kinds, the breadth of opinions and interpretations is extremely large. And so one thing i try to do is insulate my kids from that. If they choose to be on the Internet and know for particular things and create their own brand, and to some extent some of them have in their particular rounds, that's great. But I do warn them that you don't control what happens when it gets out there. So yes I have four kids, and you're welcome to talk about how they live their lives on the Internet or elsewhere.

**Jeff Bender :** Yeah I find that -  using my kids  - it can often be hard to become relatable to everyone and I found that using real-life stories, a lot of people also experience it and can relate to, and it also helps with talking to customers or to employees. That's sort of a tool that I use and I think that it has been helpful over the time and the feedback that I've received - people like it. But I do appreciate what you say - everything you put out there can and will be used against you at someone else's choice and discretion, which is not always yours for sure.

**Mark Leonard :** Just a quick observation on that. You're talking here about using story-telling and empathy as tools to communicate. I think among our groups of managers you are the best I've ever seen, you are remarkable at it. And it's a determinant skill, I encourage people to use it because as humans we tend to relate to stories. And certainly, as we go through this I try to find stories that kind of illustrate sort of beliefs that I have and wanna share. Hopefully though, also beliefs that are grounded in facts and not fiction.

**Jeff Bender :** I appreciate that. Now I wanted to pick up on something that you actually mentioned on our last Constellation board call, and that's something I think - I can't remember what we were talking about or whether we were all waiting to start the meeting - but you had mentioned or I believe I heard you mention that you had just bought a mortar mixer. Could you maybe provide more color on why someone such as yourself would be buying a mortar mixer and what you plan to do with it.

**Mark Leonard :** I don't recall what it was but it was probably sort of what we're doing in these Covid times that's out of the usual. One of the jobs I had along the way was working as a mason's helper. It was one of those things you do to make money. And as it turned out it was a wonderful job for me, one where at the end of the day you knew what you had achieved and you had a sense of accomplishment and you knew that what you did will probably still be there in a hundred years time. So that was pretty cool work. I could work as a mason when the seasons were good and I had figured out I could go to school on a semester time basis as opposed to full time, and so when I was collecting unemployment I could go to two different schools part time, collect unemployment. And once spring rolled around I could go back to work as a mason.

I did that for several years and I worked with a wonderful old mason. He was as old as the hills - kind of a hobbit of a human being. Small, incredibly muscled old guy with a straw hat and a pickup truck that was about as old as he was, tools that came from the middle ages and he sort of taught me the trade. And I started off mixing mud and mortar for him and dressing stones, and eventually pointing some walls and then building some walls. It was Idyllic. I would take my breaks and read wonderful literature, and then go back to being on a scaffold three stories up in the air pointing a stonewall. It was just a remarkable time. I lived on a farm and had an old car and one of my brother came and lived with me and worked on one of the big mills we were doing. So passion days! Going to school, learning, reading, being healthy... And so I'm trying to recapture some of that. You know maybe on weekends I can be Wally the old mason again. 

**Jeff Bender :** That sounds very inspirational. So when you were reading literature, were there authors that you would tend to read more of their work?

**Mark Leonard :** You know at that time I think I was reading John Fowles, who was a remarkably good writer, and John Barth and those kind of folks. It really was literature. It was not ancient or classical literature, but modern literature. 

**Jeff Bender :** Interesting. Now obviously everybody will be listening to the podcast and obviously going through their own changes to their routines as a result of Covid 19, what do you think to be the biggest difference to your sort of daily or typical routine that you try to adjust to because of Covid?

**Mark Leonard :** Well I think it is the same thing that you have adjusted to, which is not being in an airplane. It's lovely, but at the same time it's also a big big change. Not rushing to the airport, spending time in the airport and on airplanes. I do miss some of those southern air flights to Europe where you get uninterrupted time. But the good side of Covid for me has been surrendering to good habits. So I work out more regularly, I sleep more, I eat better, and it's been good. 

**Jeff Bender :** Yeah people ask me all the time if I miss traveling. I started working about how to think about it and establishing new habits and I realized that a lot of my thinking time, and even a bit of down time happen when I was traveling, whether it was spending time at the airport, spending time at hotels, I really started to understand how much I miss those long 7,8, when I was in Israel, you know, 10 to 12 hours flights. To just kind of, unwind things, reflect and do other things whereas now I find, the days are pretty standard, they come and go pretty quickly and it takes more of an effort to carve out that time to sort of be, again, more thoughtful and more reflective. I keep working on that. I try to keep my Wednesdays now where I try not to book too many meetings just to try to you know, get myself some time to think about those types of things. 

So do you have a morning routine? Is there a typical way that you like to start each day?

**Mark Leonard :** I tend to wake up between four and five and have the same breakfast and read two or three newspapers so, yeah, it is pretty standard. 

**Jeff Bender :** So what newspapers do you read?

**Mark Leonard :** You know, because we're in Canada, the Royal Mail is sort of the leading business newspaper but for other employees around the world you recognize the Financial Times from London which I read. And if I got through those two I will make my way into the Wall Street Journal. 

**Jeff Bender :** Oh, interesting, Ok. I know Jerry is a big fan of the Wall Street Journal. Doug, Doug Read is a big reader of papers in the morning. He has, I think it's called the South China News, he likes to add it to his readings as well to have something more of a global flavor.

So, I understand you have your Bachelor of Science, which I think is not super typical among the people we have here at Constellation, so why did you choose to study science, especially given what you just explained with your mason work?

**Mark Leonard :** What I did was dabble. So I was in many different faculties and many different universities, and over a seven year period I eventually ended up with a three-year science degree. In between I played a lot of bridge and sports and tried a lot of different faculties. 

**Jeff Bender :** What was your sport of choice?

**Mark Leonard : ** I played varsity basketball, varsity football and varsity rugby. Rugby was by far and away my preferred sport. 

**Jeff Bender : ** Back to your science degree. Would you say that you used what you learned in your science program today at Constellation?

**Mark Leonard :** You know I think there is always something you take from what you study. And I had one particular professor who had an impact upon me, fairly late in my academic career. I had a number of other profs who influenced me as well. But I think one of the characteristics of us as human beings is that our memories and knowledge has a half-life. So the stuffs we learned 40 years ago, very little of it is being used by us today. We constantly replace what we know by what is currently correct, and what we currently believe to be correct. So you got to be a lifetime learner, you got to keep sort of fill in your mind with new ideas and knowledge. And the old stuff becomes increasingly less relevant. 

**Jeff Bender :** One of the books I read recently, I forgot the author's name now but it was called *Think like a rocket scientist*, and one of the things that I took away that was interesting and caused me to sort of re-think how I go about testing the hypotheses in our portfolio is to move away to this *test it to see if you're right*, whereas the scientific approach is actually to *prove that it is actually wrong*, and if you can't prove it's wrong, perhaps, maybe there are some beliefs that you can take forward. And I think a lot of us get caught up into this paradigm of proving that we're right, and we are just looking for anything we can find that proves that we're right. And once we've found it we just want to believe it's right. And that is not the best way to go about figuring out the right thing to do. 

**Mark Leonard :** So a well-understood human frailty, it is called confirmation bias. And if you give people ten pieces of data they will choose the one that confirms what they want to believe, even if the other nine say that they're wrong. A lot of that research on human bias was done by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Daniel actually got the Nobel prize for behavioral economics. He has written a wonderful book that I recommend to everyone, called *Thinking Fast and Slow*. It came out about a decade ago. it's probably the book I recommend most to the people inside of Constellation and to our investors. It talks about, basically the biases that we carry as humans and how we can to some extent understand those biases and since it is very very hard to actually counteract something like confirmation bias unless you frame the question in a different way, which is what you were suggesting. We should try to disprove our hypothesis rather that prove it.

**Jeff Bender :** Well I read an article about Kahneman recently and someone asked him, given he has studied it and he has his theories about it and he has won the Nobel Prize, whether he still falls subject to the same biases and he said like "Oh yeah. I am not different from anybody else, I just might be a little more reflective on sort of realizing after the fact that I have actually fallen for the same biases". Which I thought was very authentic of him but very sobering to your point on understanding how we human are actually wired to think and make decisions.

So my final question regarding your education was in your MBA, what was the course that you found the most interesting and what was it that made it the most interesting for you?

**Mark Leonard :** I saw in your notes that you want me to talk about this and I wrecked my brain and could not think of any course that I liked in the MBA program. Partly that was because I went to a school that uses the case method, and hence they didn't really teach the principles, they taught the cases. And you were supposed to extract from the cases the principles. And I was not very good at doing that. 

**Jeff Bender :** And would you recommend people the MBA as an additional source of education and learning? What's your thoughts on MBAs?
