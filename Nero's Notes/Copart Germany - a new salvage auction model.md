# [[Copart]] Germany - A new Salvage Auction Model

by #InPractise 

### Andreas, can you provide some context to your background in the German salvage industry?

From my childhood, I started working in my parent’s company. They had a car dealership and, there, I took my first steps in the salvage market, because we had lots of vehicles from accidents that had been wrecked, which we had to sell or which we were buying. From that time on, I became familiar with these accident vehicles. I did my studies, went to school and I also did an exchange year in the States, in Texas. In 2005, there was a big opportunity for me that WOM, Wreck Online Market, one of the salvage auction platforms was founded and I had the chance to step into the company and to raise the company from scratch.

I started in 2005, in WOM. From there, we built out the business. We established the workflows for the total loss vehicles, we provided a very good service and we improved the service. Later on, I will talk about the key facts of what is good at WOM and differentiates it from the other salvage auctions. I started there as an assistant to the board and grew up through the different departments and, finally, became the IT product manager. I also undertook some additional certificates in IT management. We improved our platform and our interfaces to the insurance companies here in Germany. We also made a good contact with the company called Copart which then, in 2012, bought the WOM company. I still worked at WOM, until 2019, as a product manager for Copart and made sure that the processes from WOM to Copart were integrated and that the Copart business could run well, here in Germany.

In 2019, I made a decision, related to the geographical location of my family. WOM and Copart were quite a distance from my home, so I decided to switch more to the insurance side, so I started to work for an insurance company, one of the biggest here in Germany. We have 450 car assessors, who go to the vehicles and decide what to do with the vehicles and how to compensate the car owners for the loss or damage. It is actually one step before the WOM platform, so we bring the damaged vehicles to the auction platforms, to get a salvage estimate, and then compensate the car owner.

That’s where I am right now. I am a business development manager and sales manager at carexpert. As I said, it is a company owned by three insurance companies, R+V, Ergo and Nürnberger, which is also pretty close to my hometown, to my family, so I just have to drive 15 to 20 minutes and then I am at work. When I was working at WOM and Copart it to me more than an hour to get to work, sometimes even two hours. I also spent a lot of time in hotels during that time. As I am now a father of two children, I now have more time to spend with my family. Of course, during this coronavirus pandemic, I am working from home, so I have even more time to spend with my family.

### Did you approach Copart, at WOM, to sell the business?

We first met Copart at an exhibition, in 1998, where WOM was presenting their services and had a big stand. I actually made a contact with some guys at Copart, in the UK. From that time on, we met almost monthly, to talk about the opportunities for Copart, the opportunities for WOM. It took a couple of years until Copart could buy out WOM. WOM was also founded as an incorporated company and the shares sat with the big car dealership here in Germany. They sold all of their shares to Copart.

### You actually saw the vision of a potential consignment model in the early 2000s, if not earlier?

Yes, exactly.

### Can we dive into the German salvage industry. Let’s just assume we have a pre-accident value, of a vehicle, of €10,000. What is the process, typically, in Germany, when the policy holder crashes?

In the time before the salvage auctions, if there was an accident, a car assessor would look at the car and would estimate the salvage price by guessing or by orienting on some online platforms, such as mobile.de or AutoScout, newspaper announcements, where they put vehicles up for sale. This was before the auction platforms.

Then the auction platforms were built out in about 1998. This was a big improvement for the German insurance industry because now, there was a chance that the damaged vehicles could be offered to way more people, way more car dealers than before than with just these newspaper announcements. They had a good chance to get more damaged vehicles, to build out their business. For the insurance companies, the salvage value rises through these platforms.

The basic business model for the salvage auctions, in Germany, is that if you have a pre-accident value of €10,000 for your car, and you have a crash of €8,000, which could be repaired, the insurance company now don’t say, I will give you the €8,000 and you can repair your car. They put your vehicle into some salvage online auction platform and they would get, for example, a salvage price, for this damaged vehicle, of €5,000. The insurance company will say, your vehicle is not worth €2,000, which would be the repair costs subtracted from the pre-accident value; it would now be €5,000. We don’t pay out €8,000 to let your car be repaired, so that you get to the €10,000 pre-accident value. As an insurance company, we just pay €5,000 because, in the damaged condition, your vehicle is still worth €5,000.

In total, if you sell your vehicle, we pay you €5,000 and, also, you get €5,000 from a car dealer, and you will have €10,000, in total, which is the pre-accident of your vehicle, so you will be compensated. This is the major business with these salvage auction platforms.

### Let’s say I am a driver, I crash, the pre-accident value of my car was €10,000 and we believe that it would cost €8,000 to repair. The insurer doesn’t buy the vehicle back from me, like they would in the US. The insurer doesn’t really own the vehicle?

Exactly. That’s also the law here in Germany, that the insurance company are not allowed to get ownership of a vehicle. They are also not allowed, by law, to trade the vehicle, to sell the vehicle and make money from the vehicles. This is prohibited by law, here in Germany.

### Why is that?

It might create some conflicts of interest for the insurance industry, so we prevent the insurance industry taking steps into this market.

### Is the US different because they are more entrepreneurial?

Yes; not only the US, but also a couple of other European countries. I think, in France, it’s the same. If it’s a total loss and the car owner is no longer allowed to drive or keep his vehicle, the insurance company will become the owner of the vehicle. In some places, like France for example, the insurance company will also hold the certificate of your vehicle; they keep it. Here in Germany, every car owner has the vehicle registration documents, which is the certificate of ownership of a vehicle. This is in the private hands of the people who buy the cars, in Germany.

### So France could be a good opportunity for Copart too?

Of course; France could be a good opportunity too. But now they are also approaching the German or the European market, because there are also possibilities for Copart to step into the European market and I think they are doing quite well, from what I can see in general. They have some insurance companies where they are trying to change the model and introduce their business to the German European market.

### How are UK insurers regulated around vehicles or the policy holder actually owning the vehicle?

There is also Copart in the UK and they also sell their vehicles through the Copart online platform. In the UK, they are directly compensating with the insurance company and the car owner, to settle the claim.

### Is the UK model similar to the US, where the owner actually owns the vehicle and the insurer has to buy it back off them?

I’m not totally sure, but it’s working.

### If we go back to the process, I crash my vehicle and there is, supposedly, €8,000 of damage, in repairs. I assume a loss adjuster from the insurance company is sent out to look at the car?

Yes.

### If the insurance company values the car at €5,000, how exactly do they do that today?

First of all, the assessor goes to the vehicle and he estimates the repair costs. If he sees that the repair costs come to a percentage, such as 80%, of the PAV value, which would be the €8,000 repair costs, then the assessor company decide that they will put the vehicle into a salvage auction platform. They put it into these online platforms for 24 to 48 hours, so one to two days. The salvage auction platforms list the vehicles, online, all anonymous, so that nobody can see who the owner of the vehicle is. All the car dealers who are connected to these auction platforms make their offers. They are hidden offers. Nobody can see the offer made by anybody else. It’s like a hidden auction because German law says that the auction platform or the salvage estimation are not allowed to show the offers, because if you see each other’s offer, then the offers will be higher than the market price for the vehicle.

They tried to estimate, over the salvage auction platforms, a neutral market price which can only be estimated by giving hidden offers. They have a deadline when the auction stops. At that point, they send the offers back to the assessor from the auction platforms. He puts it into his car report and sends it to the insurance company who then makes the decision as how to compensate for the vehicle.

### Doesn’t the structure of those auctions depress the salvage bids?

You could say that, because it’s a neutral way of estimating the worth of a vehicle. It is also set by law that the car owner has to get the real, the neutral market price, value for his vehicle. At the moment, the only way of doing that is by putting it onto an auction platform to get hidden offers from car dealerships. Everybody will write their maximum price and maybe they will be lucky. After the auction, the platforms show how you did in the auction so you can see if you were the highest bidder or if you bid €1,000 too little to get the highest bid. This enables you to improve for your next offers.

### Again, if I’m the policy holder and I’ve crashed my car, the insurance company will put my car on the platform for me?

Yes.

### Then the buyers would bid and the insurance company would notify me of the result and what I would receive?

Yes, exactly. You, as a car owner, have nothing to do until you get the letter from your insurance company where they will offer you some compensation for your vehicle. If you have a €5,000 residual value they point out, in that letter, that your car is still worth €5,000; it has been estimated as a neutral market price, through these online salvage auctions. Here you have the car dealer, XYZ; you can sell your vehicle to him; you just need to give him a call. He will come, within 14 days, pick up your vehicle and you will receive €5,000 from him. We, as an insurance company, will pay you €5,000 so that you will have the €10,000 pre-accident value to buy yourself a new vehicle.

### I have to organize the sale myself, as the policy holder and the car owner, with a random dealer that wants to buy the car?

Yes.

### How many auction platforms are there?

WOM is one of the largest, but was not the first online auction. The first online auction was AUTOonline, which was then bought by Solera. The second one was CARTV, which is still owned by itself. Then came WOM as the third auction platform, which was sold to Copart. From the market share, AUTOonline was the biggest company, followed by CARTV and then WOM. As we started the WOM business in 2005, AUTOonline had been around since 1998 and then CARTV came in 1999 or 2000. Five years later, WOM appeared. WOM gained more and more of the market share. You can say that now the market share is split in three, to these biggest auction platforms, AUTOonline, CARTV and WOM. Those are the market leaders in the salvage online auction platforms.

Meanwhile, in 2008 or 2009, some other salvage auction platforms were founded, such as WinValue or net.casion. In total, we have five salvage online auction platforms, here in Germany, which is also of benefit for the insurance companies. If they only put their vehicle on one online salvage auction platform, they will only be offering their vehicles to one particular group of car dealers who are connected to that salvage online auction platform.

Every salvage auction platform makes sales or tries to connect to special car dealers. Maybe one auction platform has better car dealers for trucks than the others. Maybe another online auction platform has more Eastern European buyers. Another one could have more scrap car dealers who buy the completely burnt, total loss damages. It ensures that the insurance company can make money out of it, to be able to put it into three auction platforms, to pay the fee to each of the three auction platforms and still raise their offer by enough money so that they still will have some benefit from it.

### The buyers, on each of the platforms, are somewhat different?

Yes. There are also some buyers that bid on all auction platforms, who pay the fees. To sign up to a salvage auction platform, you have to register, pay a fee, maybe monthly. Some buyers are also connected to all of the salvage auction platforms because all platforms are not used by every insurance company. Some insurance companies use just AUTOonline and CARTV; some use all three or some use four. Some are maybe only using WOM and CARTV. The insurance companies also have contracts with salvage auction platforms regarding what it will cost to determine the salvage price for the vehicles.

### Do they mainly have German buyers? You mentioned Eastern European buyers, as well. But there is no global buyer base?

No, not yet. It was difficult for foreign car dealers to get the vehicles through the online auction platforms because in every country they have another VAT. If the vehicle belongs to a car owner and runs through a company, so it’s a company car, you pay the net amount for the vehicle and get back the PAV from the state. But if you sell it to another country, such as Poland, they have another PAV and it became, or was difficult, where maybe the car dealer closed his shop after buying a vehicle and the state could not give the PAV back, because the company was no longer there. The German industry prevent and do not allow foreign car dealers to buy vehicles or to estimate the market prices for the German market, which changed a little bit, during my time working at WOM. We opened the market and provided a special service for the car owners. Let’s pretend that you are a 70-year-old German citizen and you might not even speak English, and you get an offer from an auction platform with some Polish or English-speaking car dealers. You need to call him and tell him that he should pick up your vehicle, and it’s not possible.

We provided a very good service. It’s now pretty common; the salvage auction platforms, they make contact with the car owner, explain to them how it works and they will make the first step and make a contract with the car owner to sell the vehicle, do the paperwork and then also organize the pick-up date with the car dealer. If the car dealer is not from Germany, they will speak, in Polish, with the Polish car dealer, tell them exactly where to come, when to come, to pick up the vehicle and the car dealer will pay the money to the auction platform and the auction platform will pass the money to the car owner. In that way, you can also ensure that the VAT still stays in Germany, because it’s from the German salvage auction platform, to the German car owner and there will be no conflicts.

### I saw a statistic, recently, that in Germany, only 10% of buyers, who bid on a vehicle in salvage, actually receive the vehicle?

Yes.

### Why is that?

That’s because, as I mentioned, we have three or four salvage auction platforms. If the vehicle gets listed on three auction platforms, the chance is already divided by three. If you are the highest bidder on AUTOonline, maybe the offer from CARTV or WOM or from another auction platform is higher. You might not know, but you see you gave the highest salvage for the vehicle so you think you will get the vehicle, but that’s not the case. The fact is, maybe another auction platform has been sent in the letter to the insurance company. Of course, the insurance company passes the letter along to the car owner which says, we are paying you €5,000, your repair is €8,000, if you sell your vehicle, you get another €5,000. Then the car owner, he owns the vehicle and he has to make the decision whether to sell his vehicle.

Maybe he says, I love my vehicle. I will go to my neighbor who has a small repair shop and he can do some repairs, some fixes for my vehicle, for less than the €8,000; maybe it will only cost me €5,000. So I will take the €5,000 from the insurance company, give it to my neighbor and he will fix my vehicle, so I can still drive my car and there is no need to sell it. This is another percentage which also explains why it is not the case that 100% of the highest bids get sold, from the online salvage auction platforms.

### So it’s actually a pretty bad experience for the buyers, in that they could be bidding on different vehicles and not actually know if they are going to receive the vehicle?

Exactly. Also, on top of that, the buyers have to keep their offer open for the next three weeks. Within the next three weeks, it is possible for the car owner to call the car dealer and he has to buy the vehicle. They are tying up lots of money within these offers that they make on the online salvage auction platforms. Assume they are making the best offers and they get more than 10% of the vehicles. Maybe they get 50%, then they need to have enough money in their pocket to really have the cash to buy out all the vehicles. They have to calculate and to have their business running, to get 10 vehicles every month, let’s say, then they would have to make lots of offers.

### As you said, the policy holder owns the car so they could actually turn down the offer and keep the car, or get it repaired themselves.

Yes.

### It seems as if it is a very inefficient process to sell the vehicle?

Yes. The car owner owns the vehicle. Maybe he loves his car so much and does not need the €5,000 for selling his vehicle. He says, I will put it in my garden, for the children to play on it, so I won’t sell it.

### What do you think is the most challenging part of the process, in that traditional salvage model, in Germany?

The most challenging part is, or was, when I stepped into this kind of business, was to really build out and perfect a good service to the car owners. At the very beginning, the car owners were left alone. They got their letter from the insurance company then they had to call and do everything by themselves. We started to provide good services, that maybe are not measurable for the KPIs of a company, but how good is the service they bring. They don’t get any money to talk to the car owner 10 times, to hold his hand and convince him that everything will work out fine for him and that he will definitely get his money. This is all the hard work done by the salvage auction platforms.

### Would you say that the real inefficiency in the market is actually on the policy holder side, the car owner side? What about the car insurance companies? Where is the real inefficiency here?

The insurance companies are actually happy because they don’t have to pay €8,000 to get the vehicle repaired; they just pay €5,000. With one wreck, they have saved €3,000. Of course, they have to pay the fees for the salvage auction platforms, they have to pay the assessor and so on. It’s a very big business, here in Germany, with the salvage prices which the insurance company compensate. The insurance company are also interested in ensuring that the car owners, or the insurer, are not afraid or unhappy and will call the insurance company and complain that something is not working. The goal of the German insurance company is also to have excellent service for the insured owner. This is where the WOM fully steps in, hand in hand with the goals of the insurance companies. This was one benefit of WOM where their market approach made it easy for them to gain more and more market share.

### The car insurance companies are actually receiving, historically, a pretty good deal because they are listing their cars on three or four auction sites already?

Yes.

### Maybe we can take a step back and look at the evolution of WOM. How did the business change when Copart purchased it?

There was always the thought, for all salvage auction platforms, to step into that regulation process of an insurer, where the salvage auction platform would pay out the PAV value to the car owner and then do the rest, the selling of the vehicle, by itself. But it was too much money that they had to keep to do this process. Also, many auction platforms had the thought of not sending out the car dealers to all the private households, all over Germany. Why not collect all the vehicles, to one place in Germany, and then let the car dealers come there, to pick up the vehicles?

Maybe you could have more places, near the border, towards some Eastern European countries, so that their journey to pick up the vehicle would be shortened. This would also speak for a higher residual value of the vehicle. These were always thoughts for the online auction platforms. Copart, with the Copart business, buying out their own land, putting the vehicles and now stepping, as well, into regulation, with the insurer, made very good points for WOM, to change the German market and to be more successful here in Germany and in Europe.

### Why didn’t WOM or AUTOonline merge or do this themselves, without Copart?

There were some tests going on, but they didn’t have the platform, at that time, to sell the vehicles, like Copart is doing, via online auction platforms, to get an even higher price. They had the online auctions, with the hidden offers and some of the salvage auction platforms also tried step into the market of fleet or leasing companies, to regulate their vehicles. For them, of course, there was no need to have hidden offers. They wanted the highest offer and so they made two auction platforms. One hidden, to estimate the neutral market price of the damaged vehicles, and one open auction platform where everybody can see each other’s offer, to get an even higher price for car rental or leasing companies.

### So Copart’s advantage in Germany is that they have the global buyer network and the auction platform that is, potentially, open? But isn’t it only open for fleet managers and dealers and not for the actual insurance company vehicles?

No. When Copart approached the German market, they were launching their own online auction platform. They have a very successful and patented online auction platform system, which I saw in England, when I was at the Copart headquarters there, in Wootton. It’s a very good system. They approached the European market, with their own online auction platform system and, therefore, they left the closed online auction platform system – the WOM system – running, so they did not mix those IT platforms.

### So there are two platforms that Copart run? One WOM and one Copart?

Yes, exactly. WOM is still a company on its own, running by itself. Copart is its own company, as well. But, of course, WOM is owned by Copart.

### Are the WOM vehicles only insurance vehicles and Copart only deals with dealers and fleet managers?

Yes. They started out approaching the market, first of all, with car rental companies and fleets, to have those vehicles listed.

### Can Copart sell the insurance vehicles via their open auction platform? I think you mentioned that the regulatory landscape in Germany doesn’t allow that?

Correct. Actually, to determine the salvage price, it is not possible for Copart to get to the vehicles, but they do have some very good established business models and they have spoken to some well-known business analyst companies here in Germany. They have worked out some good ideas and have started to talk to the insurance companies, where they have some new papers related to vehicle regulations, which are presented to the car owner and where the car owner has to sign that once the insurance company has compensated for his loss, that he will get the PAV value directly from Copart and Copart will pick up his vehicle.

In the background, the insurance company are just paying the residual value, the €5,000, to Copart and Copart will now list those vehicles on their open online auction platform. Maybe they will now get an offer of higher than €5,000 for the vehicle; maybe they will get €6,000 or €7,000 and they will split that additional value with the insurance company. They will not give it to the insurance company as a win or a directly-connected fee for the vehicle. But for the service of giving the regulation form to the car owner, Copart will pay that amount of money. There is a small gap in the law which makes it possible for Copart to get to the vehicles from the car owners.

### So Copart has changed the auto insurance regulatory landscape?

Yes; they are stepping into it right now. They have a couple of insurance companies that are testing the Copart model and Copart is getting more and more vehicles from those sources.

### Is this a recent development? Was it in 2020 or 2019 that this change in regulation passed?

Yes, you could say that. They have already worked on it for a while. I think it was finished in 2017 and they had the strategy worked out for the German market and they are now bringing it to the insurance companies.

### Just going back, I think Copart bought WOM in 2012, so this has been quite a long journey?

Yes. There were lots of regulations, here in Germany, which WOM has to be aware of. The vehicles in the salvage auction platforms have to be totally anonymized so that there is no possibility for the car dealers to find out who this vehicle belongs to. At the very beginning of the salvage auction platforms, the vehicles were listed and everybody could see who these vehicles belonged to. All the car dealers, connected to the auction platform, they were not making their offers to the auction platform, but they were trying to contact the car owner directly and do some quick business to get the vehicle. It is not possible for a car owner to speak to thousands of car dealers to, effectively, do the auction himself. This was very chaotic.

### What does the regulator think of Copart and this new change, with Copart coming into the market and adapting the regulatory landscape somewhat and changing that to make it possible. Yes, it is a much better experience for the car owner, which is very important, but is the German regulator happy about this or they know it’s happening?

You could say that the insurance companies are testing it at the moment and they are quite happy, because the process is much faster than having it sold by a traditional salvage online auction platform. Copart pays the PAV value directly.

### How does that work? Can we go through this, using the €10,000 vehicle example? If I crash the vehicle, what happens then in today’s new consignment model?

A car assessor, from the insurer, will come and estimate the repair costs. He sees that it is €8,000 for repair costs and the vehicle is only worth €10,000. It’s running to a total loss and I am not able to get you your €10,000 pre-accident value directly. Here are some papers from the insurance company. You have to sign here and then you get the PAV value paid by Copart. You will have the money tomorrow, in your bank account. Copart will come and pick up the vehicle and will sell it, dismantle it or do whatever it can with your vehicle. You will have the money tomorrow. It’s very attractive for the car owner as opposed to waiting for the paperwork from the insurance company, having to talk to the car dealerships to sell his vehicle. This process is very short.

### But there is now this new regulatory document or paper that allows the insurance to almost sign over the ownership of the vehicle, from the owner, to Copart directly? Copart, literally, pays that pre-accident value, immediately, to the car owner?

Exactly.

### Copart can then legally sell that car, as an owner of the vehicle, to their global audience?

Yes.

### I guess the adjuster would have to estimate the salvage price? Would they do that, given the existing online auction in Germany?

There are different possibilities. Copart also has the possibility of estimating residual values on their own platform and then the insurance company will pay this Copart-estimated residual value, to Copart or they will put it into the traditional salvage auction platforms, just to get the salvage price. This will now, of course, lower the percentage of the car dealers getting the vehicles, even more, because they will be sold by Copart. It will no longer be 10%, but it will go down to close to 0% for the car dealers and then the salvage online auction platforms will start to struggle.

### Let’s say the salvage vehicle price is €5,000; Copart pays €10,000 to the owner. If Copart puts it on the platform and it gets lots of bids and sells for €6,000, that means that Copart has to go back to the insurance company and say, I’ve just sold the car for €6,000; we thought the salvage price was €5,000, so you only have to pay me €4,000? Is that right?

No. They will get €5,000 from the insurance company and the €6,000 which they have just sold the car for – because it is not a neutral market price, it is the additional service from Copart, which they made on top – so €1,000 more, and they will split that with the insurance company and give them €500 and say, thank you very much that we were able to do this and everybody is happy.

### So it’s a different way of sharing the value?

Yes, exactly.

### The insurance company clearly has a great incentive to go through Copart because they could, potentially, have a higher expense ratio for the policy?

Yes, exactly.

### That goes back to the essence of what Copart has an advantage on which is the global buyer base and the network effects they have?

Yes; and they have the big advantage of their own land, their places here in Germany, where they put their vehicles. They have their own transporters, to pick up the vehicles and bring them to their own land. The international buyers are coming to Copart to pick up the vehicles. They have fixed locations and nobody else has that, here in Germany.

### Because the dealers have to go to the owners from the other companies?

Yes.

### Do you think that is going to attracts lots more buyers to Copart, because of the ease of doing business with them?

Actually, at a certain point, the buyers have to move to Copart. At Copart, if they give the highest offer, they will get the vehicle 100% of the time. At WOM, CARTV or AUTOonline, they will make offers and they will recognize that they will not even get 10%; it will be decreased, in percentage terms, for the return of the vehicles that they will get. At a certain point, a clever buyer has to move to the Copart model.

### What has been the biggest barrier to Copart growing in Germany?

The biggest barrier is, actually, talking to the insurance companies, to get their model running, approved, so that they can see some success stories. Also, to get the acceptance of the car dealers, particularly the German car dealers. Looking at the history of WOM, for example, they were very powerful because they had a big buyer base in the background with the German Car Dealer Association. Once Copart also gets the Car Dealer Association in the background, it will be even better for them.

They already have a very good global buyer base and they have to use it. We have lots of restrictions here in Germany, in Europe, because of data protection and so on. Copart should really make it possible for there to be international accessibility to bid on these vehicles.

### Don’t WOM and Copart share the same dealers?

Yes; probably. On every auction platform, the dealers are shared or are participating in the other platforms as well.

### Is there any reason why the insurance companies wouldn’t move over with Copart and roll out a consignment model?

Because it’s a new model, and everything that is new has to prove itself first. Once it has been proven that it will work out, that it will not cause any trouble, then more and more insurance companies will take part in this model.

### If you look five or seven years out in Germany, how do you think the market is going to evolve?

I think Copart will be successful, and will build out its business, more and more, here in Germany. It will be accepted by more and more insurance companies and be used by more insurance companies. In the long term, maybe there is no longer a need for salvage auction platforms in the way that they exist right now. Also, the landscape of the car assessors will probably also change. Maybe, at a certain point, the car assessors will no longer be necessary in the way that they are used today, by the insurance companies.

### Do you mean the loss adjusters?

Yes.

### Why do you think that could change?

Copart or the insurance company can look at the vehicle digitally, with digitalization moving forward. They have better and better systems in the insurance companies so if they speak to the car owners they can already, on the phone, estimate the repair costs. They know that the vehicle is 10 years old, what the mileage is, the total front is damaged, the engine is not running, all the lights are blinking. This can then be a total loss, so why pay a car assessor a couple of hundred euros to have a look at the vehicle? Why not give it directly to Copart?

### Right now, the insurance company pays the assessor, the loss adjuster, to go out to the vehicle and assess it?

Exactly.

### How exactly does Copart assess the vehicles?

They don’t really assess the vehicles. They make a condition check. I think, on their auction platform, they have three conditions, such as run and drive, some electrical check and on where nothing is working. These condition checks are done at the Copart yards. If you go to the website, you can see the vehicle checks. This is their condition check, which is common in the US, so why do you need an assessor? You will need an assessor if someone goes to a repair shop and gets their car repaired, to find out the repair costs and the cost of the damaged parts.

For the car dealers at Copart, they’re just getting very good pictures of the vehicles and they can estimate the repairs costs from that.

### Can you just share a bit of insight into exactly what you are doing today and how you are working with the insurance companies?

Today, we are speaking to a lot of insurance companies to talk about the Copart model. We talk about how to send the assessors and what to look at when doing a car report, so that the insurance company can compensate for their vehicles. In Germany, once a year, it is hail season so we look at how to compensate for all these vehicles damaged by hail. We have lots of concepts and we also have lots of digital processes. Additionally, as I said before, we have a process for the insurance companies to estimate the damage. We have apps; sometimes we don’t send out a car assessor. In these times of coronavirus, we often send out a link where the car owner can open up an app and take pictures of the vehicle. In the background, we will then do the car reports.

### Is that changing the total loss percentage?

Not really.

### How has the total loss percentage changed in Germany?

The parts of vehicles that are built in, like all the sensors for autonomous driving, the cameras and so on, they are very cost intensive. Even a small amount of damage on the vehicle can mean a couple of thousand euros in repair costs. Actually, the repair costs will go up, more and more, because of the vehicles and the systems that have been built into the cars. Maybe Copart then has to focus on the fact that sometimes, even on the picture, you cannot tell if these integrated systems are working or if they are damaged. The picture might not show you that a camera has been broken or is not working. It looks fine, but maybe it’s not working and it will cost €1,500 just to replace the camera. These car-driver systems are becoming important to point out, on an auction plan, to have it listed if it is not working.

### I think we have seen the total loss ratio increase from 12% or 13%, in the US five, six, seven years ago, to up to nearly 20% today? How does that compare with Germany?

It depends. It goes up and down, because of the systems which are built into the vehicles. The manufacturers will say, it’s almost no longer possible to get into a total loss, because your car will stop itself; it will hit the brakes automatically so the number of total losses will decrease. But actually, what we see at the moment is that it is going up, because the systems in the vehicle are very cost intensive, as I said, and you will now have even more total losses than before. The systems are not built into every car and it’s not working out that well. We have lots of accidents and the number of accidents is also still rising. From my perspective, in the future, there will still be accidents, but probably smaller accidents, because the intensity of an accident will be reduced by those systems in the car. There will just be small scratches at the supermarket and so on, where the car system will not help you.

### Lower total losses, potentially, in five to 10 years, in your opinion?

Yes.

### You think we are in a sweet spot for the salvage industry, where you have increased accidents, the systems are not perfectly preventing crashes, so you get lots of crashes and lots of total losses. But as the technology does improve, we’re going to see, potentially, lower losses and less intense accidents?

Yes.

### Just to summarize our conversation, Andreas, what do you think is the real competitive advantage for Copart, in Germany?

The big benefit of Copart is that they have their own land, they have their own auction platform, which is open, and they have a very big buyer base from whom they can get offers for the vehicles. These are some of the major factors which make the Copart model successful. Of course, they now have a new managing director for Germany and Europe, Kai Siersleben. He is also a very good guy who I recommended to Copart. He was the CEO of AUTOonline before AUTOonline was sold to Solera. He also built out the traditional salvage online auction platforms, in Germany. He is a very good man who will also give support to the Copart model being accepted by the insurance companies, which is also a major barrier and key for the success of the model here.

### What could be a reason why they wouldn’t accept the Copart model? Let’s say, in 10 years’ time, we look back on the industry and we are still in the same position. It’s still very slow or not moving quickly; what do you think could be the reason?

The only reason would be some car owners who will say, no, I don’t want to sell my vehicle. It is my vehicle and I want to decide where to sell it. I want to sell it here, in my hometown, to that car dealer. I will go to court if needed, because I don’t trust any company who comes with their own transporter, taking my vehicle anywhere. I will sell it either to my local town car dealer or I will get it repaired and I want to have the money for the repair costs, from the insurance companies. The car owners not accepting the model would be one issue.

### Doesn’t the insurance company persuade them?

Yes, they will try to because they will save lots of money.

### Really, it’s about the car owner trusting the insurance company?

Yes.

### So the question is, does the insurance company want to work with Copart?

Yes.

### In your experience in dealing with the big German insurers, how would you describe their approaches to working with someone like Copart?

Some of the people in the insurance companies have been working there for 30 years, they are big companies, and some of them might not be willing to change anything. They will say that it worked out for the last 20 years; it will work for the next 20 years, until I retire. Of course, there are other young people, like me, who believe that there is a time for change and that there can be even more profit for the insurance company, by introducing a new system into the salvage process or regulation with the car owners.

Maybe, in 10 years, it will change to that way, like it is in France and the US or UK, where the car insurance companies also take the title of the vehicle and they will ship it over to Copart. But this is not happening right now and they are not even approaching taking on this method at the moment. It is possible that it will change.

### Would that require a change in the regulation, as you mentioned, that they would own the car?

Yes.

### How do you look at the potential profitability of Copart in Germany, versus other countries like the UK or the US?

It’s hard to say, but there are millions of damaged vehicles here, every year, so it will be a good place, in Germany, a good location to step into even further markets, towards the Eastern European countries – to Poland, to Russia – to get even higher values. I think that that this is also one of Copart’s goals, to directly sell to the private person in Russia, in Poland, who wants to buy the vehicle, without any dealers in between who also want to make money. They want to sell directly to the private person who wants to buy this damaged vehicle and fix it himself. This is a very good way of raising the values of the damaged vehicles.

### So it also actually provides a hub, in the middle of Europe, for Copart to start moving vehicles across the continent?

Yes, and maybe at a certain point, Copart will start to take the vehicles to the car owners, to the private households, in the backyard of Poland. They may take it to his door and earn another couple of hundred euros for that service, and the private owner would not even have to arrange for a company to pick up the vehicle from the Copart land. Maybe, in the future, they will have ships and other methods of getting the vehicles to the buyers.

### Do you think that is likely?

Yes, I think it’s possible?

### That could be pretty interesting. It would almost let Copart move into the B2C market?

Yes.

### During your time at WOM and Copart, what did you learn or experience that was particularly unique about Copart and the culture and the business and how they operate in the market?

I loved the story and read Willis Johnson’s book, where I learned that Copart was founded out of a single car dealership and spread out through the whole country, in America. This reminded me of my own background. I also started working in the family business, in a small dealership, which also grew. Then I decided to step into the online auction platforms, to build out the platform and then I went to the insurance companies. The business is very familiar and is still owned privately and even though it is listed on the Nasdaq, you still have a familiar culture in the company. I think it is a good place to work and it is a well-driven company, with this background, because the founders are still in the company and they know how the market works. They will do everything they can to make the company successful, not only in America, but also in Europe.

### Is there any reason why they can’t move into Eastern Europe, for example, such as Poland, Ukraine or any other countries?

Not really. They could move in that direction. Obviously, the infrastructure in Germany is at a very high standard and the further you move towards the Eastern European countries, the infrastructure will not be at that same level. It will get lower and lower, so it makes sense to start from here, with very good infrastructure and then continue the move to the Eastern European countries.

### It’s going to be fascinating to watch.
