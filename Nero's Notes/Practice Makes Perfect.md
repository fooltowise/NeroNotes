# Practice makes Perfect

## by [[Demesne Investments]]

There are few business models that elicit more division amongst investors than the serial acquirer. Like a stock picker’s Rorschach test, the very term “serial acquirer” can be either a pejorative or a selling-point depending on the audience. Prejudices are just as likely to be determined by knee-jerk associations with high-profile successes or failures as they are by sober analysis. Although the decentralized companies that I seek are a rare breed no matter where I search, the ranks of [[serial acquirers]] are not a bad place to look. The connection is obvious – decentralized companies are comprised of numerous businesses, and [[serial acquirers]] purchase numerous businesses. Though I would classify only a minority of [[serial acquirers]] as true practitioners of decentralization, the controversy that accompanies the space encourages me that there is value to be found here. 

In this letter, I will be exploring these themes of decentralization, serial acquisitions, and investor perceptions by discussing two [[serial acquirers]], [[Constellation Software]] and J2 Global. Both companies were founded in the same year (1995), have similar margin structures, and have grown primarily through many acquisitions. However, they have had vastly different outcomes. Despite an enterprise value at its 2006 IPO of roughly a quarter the size of the already-public J2, Constellation is now worth over $24 billion, roughly six times the value of J2 Global today (and has also distributed twice the amount of dividends as J2). Similarly, Constellation shareholders have enjoyed just shy of 40% annualized total returns over that period while J2’s have received about 8%, roughly in line with the S&P 500.

Performance has naturally impacted investor perceptions. Constellation is adored by investors for its execution and disciplined capital allocation. J2, on the other hand, seems persistently under a shadow of skepticism and periodic short-seller attacks over concerns about its business model and governance. In fact, a new, high-profile short thesis was published as I was writing this letter. These diverging perceptions are why Constellation trades at ~35x trailing free cash flow, and J2 trades at less than 10x. Investors trust Constellation so much that they assume it will create significant future value (perhaps too significant). They distrust J2 so much that they believe it cannot create any incremental value. Constellation therefore stands as a monument both to what could have been and what still could be for J2.

Most importantly for Demesne, Constellation has operated under a radically decentralized model since its very beginning. J2 has operated under...something else. There are many explanations for the drastically different experiences of these two companies, but it is my belief that all the important ones are connected to decentralization, or a lack thereof, in one way or another.

This comparison becomes especially interesting in light of the recent management changes at J2, which has coincided with a lurch towards a more decentralized operating model. The new CEO has even cited Constellation as an aspirational peer in public statements. It is possible he invites this comparison superficially, hoping investors will reward J2 with Constellation’s valuation multiple without doing the hard work of emulating the unorthodox practices that have made Constellation successful. It is therefore the task of this letter to juxtapose these two companies, both historically and prospectively, to see where the key differences and similarities are. In the course of doing so, I will call out a handful of best practices for decentralized [[serial acquirers]].

Overall, I find that J2 has laid some groundwork that rhymes with the unique tendencies of Constellation, but it is still very much a work-in-progress with notable areas of serious caution. Before getting to that though, I must first address the elephant in the room – the gloomy academic research on acquisition value creation.


## The Blind Spots in the Bleak Data on [[Mergers and Acquisitions]]

The academic literature on M&A is not flattering for acquisitive companies. Numerous studies repeatedly show that on average, buyers break even at best on acquisitions, while sellers capture all the gains. Most investors will be familiar with the common explanations for this phenomenon: one acquisition begets pressure to complete the next, overconfidence on synergies, empire-building management teams, commitment bias, the so-called winner’s curse, or even nefarious efforts to obfuscate deteriorating underlying fundamentals. Whatever the explanation, the data certainly makes it seem like [[serial acquirers]] are playing a losing game.

What might be lost on academic statisticians and casual consumers of this literature is a pesky fact that practitioners know all too well – acquisition data is non-standardized, messy, and often not even disclosed. This is especially true for smaller and/or private acquisition targets. Unfortunately, private companies (which of course skew smaller than public companies) comprise the vast majority of deal-making.

More importantly, smaller companies come at cheaper prices. This is a conclusion obvious to common investor experience and corroborated by scholarly research across virtually all asset classes. Similarly, acquisitions of private companies tend to come cheaper than public companies (though this gap seems to have shrunk significantly at the large end of the spectrum). The academic research on acquirers therefore has a sample bias problem – the best returns are hidden within the messiest (or non-existent!) data.

The problems do not end at sample bias though. To make matters worse, the standard by which most of the academic research measures the value creation or destruction of M&A is one-day stock price returns. Needless to say, one-day returns are of little relevance to a long-term investor, especially one who does not subscribe to the theory that all new information is perfectly processed by the market in a single day. Another more subtle problem with this methodology is that one-day returns overlook the value of a string of small acquisitions that are individually immaterial (and thus have no single-day effect on the stock price) but collectively significant.

Thus, it seems that the blind spots of the academic research silhouette the most promising specimens – [[serial acquirers]] of smaller and predominantly private businesses. I was able to find one study by McKinsey, originally conducted in 20128 and refreshed in 2019, that sheds some much-needed light on just these kinds of acquirers by making two key methodological choices: (1) measuring 10-year shareholder returns and (2) differentiating between acquirers by the frequency and size of their deal-making. They found that “programmatic acquirers”, which execute multiple small deals that are significant in aggregate, performed the best even compared to companies that predominantly grew organically. Incidentally, it also affirmed the conclusions of the rest of the academic research that large acquisitions are fraught with hazards.

We should always be cautious of placing too much faith into one study. This McKinsey research is valuable because it lacks some of the methodological shortcomings common to this genre, but it certainly has its own flaws. This underscores why it is important for any investor to ground investment strategies in reasonable first  principles. I believe the following principles are as reasonable as they come:

1) Smaller companies tend to come cheaper than larger ones.
2) Smaller acquisitions tend to be lower risk to the acquirer, by virtue of
relative size and simplicity.
3) Private companies tend to come cheaper than public ones.
4) Repetition (in acquisitions) builds skill.

Therefore, the case for [[serial acquirers]] that programmatically purchase small, private, and hopefully therefore cheap businesses appears promising. Let us now turn to two live examples – [[Constellation Software]] and J2 Global.

## A Brief Introduction to [[Constellation Software]] and J2 Global
Stock connoisseurs in my readership are no doubt well aware of [[Constellation Software]], a conglomerate of vertical market software businesses, and its much-celebrated founder and CEO, [[Mark Leonard]]. It is beloved by seemingly every investor who knows it and has inspired a number of copycats. The entire premise of the business model is to serially acquire small, industry-specific software businesses for cheap prices and let them run relatively autonomously, albeit with specific guardrails around profitability and cash flow targets. I deserve no originality points for praising Constellation. Nonetheless, as a collector of decentralized businesses, it behooves me to highlight Constellation as a standard-bearer of best practices.

Prior to founding Constellation, Mr. Leonard was a venture capitalist. During that time, he saw a vast landscape of small, lower growth, but predictably profitable software companies in need of a long-term home that did not fit with venture capital or private equity. The thesis was simple – aggregate these small niche businesses, give them a stable home, and help each of them succeed. Then recycle their cash flow to do it again and again and again. Importantly, from the very beginning the acquisition opportunity was married with decentralization, as described in Constellation’s 2006 IPO prospectus:

> “Our decentralized management structure has allowed us to create management teams with key customer relationships and deep market knowledge that are more focused and efficient than would be the case under a centralized management model. These teams provide our corporate head office and operating group managers with the ability to concentrate on issues such as capital allocation and the tracking of overall performance, while the VMS business managers concentrate on maximizing profitability and pursuing organic initiatives and tuck-in acquisitions. This creates a high degree of scalability within our business model, and provides us with the opportunity to continue growing over both the short and long-term.”

Even by serial acquirer standards, Constellation is extremely acquisitive. To illustrate just how much of an outlier it is, consider the past three years of software deal volume by the Corum Group, a boutique tech M&A advisory firm (Constellation’s logo is the blue one with the big “C”).

![[Screen Shot 2022-01-18 at 17.57.31.png]]![[Screen Shot 2022-01-18 at 17.57.42.png]]

If you are wondering what happened to Constellation in 2019, take note of the red box I added to that chart as a clue – it broke the graph. Constellation’s whopping 75 acquisitions10 would have once again towered over all the other acquirers, but Corum decided to remove the “strategic acquirer” label from Constellation and instead give it the new, tailor-made “accumulator” moniker. Keen observers might notice that the only other constituent to appear each year that isn’t a mega tech or consulting company is J2 Global (which I should note really isn’t a software company). In fact, J2 was at the top of 2016’s chart, though I think that is only because Constellation’s acquisitions were undercounted.

Unlike Constellation, which set decentralization as a North Star from the start, J2 Global has had a more meandering evolution from its origins as hyped-up dotcom company. It was founded in 1995 as JFax, an ad-supported internet fax service. It IPO’d in 1999 at the height of the dotcom bubble but was one of the few that managed to survive the ensuing bust. Its early years were preoccupied with consolidating the efax market and branching out into other digital communication tools like email marketing, phone conferencing, and some others that are now defunct. These products were almost always acquired, not developed internally. Acquisitions were framed predominantly as purchases of products or customers to be integrated into existing platforms rather than standalone businesses. In those earlier years, J2 identified itself as a “communications” company, offering low price-point products targeted at small-and-medium sized businesses. These offerings (including some moremodern additions) remain a significant 
part of the business today. In fact, efax is still just under a quarter of revenues, having far outlived the recurrent analyst predictions of its imminent demise many times over. 

In 2012, J2 ventured further outside its wheelhouse with its watershed purchase of Ziff Davis. Once a proud media empire, Ziff Davis had by this time been reduced to just the PCMag brand (the magazine was no longer in circulation), and a handful of other mall digital brands. Two years earlier, Ziff Davis had been purchased out of bankruptcy by a former Time executive named Vivek Shah (with the backing of private equity), who had already made significant headway turning it around. 

Mr. Shah continued to run Ziff Davis under J2’s ownership. Armed with much better access to capital, he built out a portfolio of niche digital brands and businesses such as IGN (gaming), Humble Bundle (also gaming), Ookla (better known to you as Speedtest), Everyday Health, and others. These businesses were operated under a business unit structure that was later extended to the entire company when he became CEO at the beginning of 2018. He also hired a new VP of M&A and charged him with the task of creating a more systematic, robust, and disciplined acquisition process that did not depend upon any one individual (i.e. a programmatic acquisition strategy). Finally, J2 eliminated its dividend, which had historically amounted to ~25% of free cash flow:
>“All of this is contributing to one of the most robust sets of investment opportunities the company has ever seen, which gives us confidence that we can put ever larger amounts of capital to work that will still yield returns 2 to 3x our cost of capital. Simply put, as stewards of the company's capital, we believe redirecting the dividend to these investment opportunities will yield better returns for our shareholders, which is why we are suspending the dividend after the June payment.”
– Vivek Shah, J2 Global CEO (Q1 2019 Earnings Call)

So, with Mr. Shah’s ascendency to the CEO position, we saw (1) a move towards a more decentralized structure (2) a more defined and systematic process built around the serial acquisition strategy and (3) a conventionally unpopular but sensible capital allocation decision. With that as a backdrop, I now want to turn to some of the best practices of decentralized [[serial acquirers]] as exhibited by the standard-bearer of this strategy, [[Constellation Software]], and see how J2 Global compares.

## Constellations of Many Autonomous Businesses
> “CSI's strategy is to be a good owner of hundreds (and perhaps someday thousands) of growing autonomous small businesses that generate high returns on capital. Our strategy is unusual. Most CEO's of public companies would rather run a single big business - perhaps two or three big businesses, but rarely 200 businesses...We recognise that economies of scale, centralised management and world class talent competing in large and growing markets can be a great business-building formula. But, it isn't what we do. We seek out vertical market software businesses where motivated small teams composed of good people, can produce superior results in tiny markets.” – Mark Leonard, [[Constellation Software]] CEO (2017 President’s Letter)

Aside from being the most succinct thesis for the merits of a decentralized operating model I have found to date, this passage also elicits a double take for the “200 businesses” remark. This letter was written in 2018 and the number of business units inside Constellation has only grown since then. My rough guess is that they now have somewhere over 300 autonomous business units (but I would not be surprised to learn if the true number was much higher). It is the result of over 500 acquisitions, implying that a majority are kept as standalone businesses.

It is indeed exceptionally rare to find a conglomerate with over a hundred distinct business units, but if you do, there’s a good chance it is a decentralized one. Teledyne, while under the leadership of the legendary Henry Singleton, was one such example that old-school investors may remember. [[Addtech]], which I discussed in my previous letter (See [[Once Upon a Time in Sweden]]), is another current example among a handful of others I track. Most of the decentralized companies I follow are a bit more modest, having dozens rather than hundreds of business units. Even at those levels, the point still stands – it is a sharp departure from the convention of buying and consolidating around a handful of large businesses. This is not to say that decentralized businesses never consolidate and integrate acquisitions, because they do (more on that later). It is just that they have a much higher propensity to keep acquisitions as distinct independent units and tailor their M&A activity to target the kinds of prospects that fit with that predisposition.

In contrast to Constellation, J2 Global has completed over 180 acquisitions since inception but has just 13 business units, indicative of a much higher bias towards centralization and consolidation. The good news is that the vast majority of this consolidation happened with very small acquisitions. This is because J2 has historically skewed its M&A activity towards the acquisition of products and customers that could be migrated to a preexisting platform. I actually have no qualms with a decentralized company utilizing this strategy as part of its capital allocation toolset (Constellation does it too). These kinds of acquisitions tend to be small, cheap, and low risk. For example, customer acquisitions via M&A make a lot of sense for digital businesses like J2’s eFax, where the underlying technology is commoditized, the industry is consolidating, and customers can be easily transitioned to an existing platform without much disruption. What J2 has historically been lacking vis-à-vis Constellation are the acquisitions of businesses robust enough to continue operating independently under their umbrella. How many of J2’s 180+ acquisitions could have passed that test if they had been more decentrally inclined in the first place is anybody’s guess. Going forward, if J2 is serious about fostering entrepreneurialism via decentralization, I would expect the number of independent business units to proliferate. Based on public commentary and my own conversations with the company, I think they would welcome significantly more business units under their new structure, but only time will tell.

One relevant caveat on this point is that semantics can complicate something as simple as counting business units. As mentioned above, J2 has 13 formal business units, but some 40+ different brands. Those brands are usually not distinct businesses unto themselves, but occasionally they are, or somewhere in between. For example, Ekahau is a provider of software to optimize commercial Wi-Fi deployments. It was acquired by J2 subsidiary Ookla (aka Speedtest) in 2018. Originally, J2 intended to integrate Ekahau into the pre-existing Ookla business unit. However, while still technically a part of the same business unit as Ookla, J2 opted to give Ekahau its own General Manager (their term for a subsidiary CEO). As far as I understand, Ekahau has been left to operate relatively autonomously given its momentum, at least for now.

This should go without saying, but the maximization of business units is not a worthwhile end in itself. The proliferation of business units is simply the exhaust of a well-oiled decentralized serial acquirer16. The real merits of this model are ones with which my readers are hopefully becoming increasingly familiar - the blunting of bureaucratic creep, fostering a sense of ownership, intensity of focus in niches, etc.


## Human-Scale Business Units
>“I believe that teams of 40, 50, maybe up to 100, tend to be eminently manageable and nimble and do wonderful work. I find that when you get up to 400 or 500 people, you need to have rocket scientists inside those teams because it's really hard to coordinate the activities of that many people in a single pursuit or business unit. So I'm constantly amazed by people who run 1,000-person or 10,000-person single business units. We don't have many big ones. We have lots and lots of 40-person and 50-person and 100-person business units. I'm not sure that when you start pushing past there that you get tremendous economies of scale. If you're addressing a large vertical, where the total available market is sufficient that you can push past there without hitting diminishing returns, then I think what happens is you either subsegment the market and come up with differentiated positioning and make good money out of doing that, or else you figure out how to manage the complexities of scaling up the business. And I think either of those are viable strategies. I just think the latter, the scaling up the business, is inherently difficult and sometimes dangerous.”
– Mark Leonard, [[Constellation Software]] CEO (Q3 2014 Earnings Call)

It was implicit in the previous section that to have dozens or even hundreds of business units, those units will need to be commensurately small. However, it begs the question – aren’t small business units at a competitive disadvantage in a world where analysts incessantly preach the gospel of scale?

Mr. Leonard articulates a counterpoint above that my readers will recognize from my previous letters – complexity increases with size. The costs of complexity can be enormous, but not as an identifiable expense line in a financial statement. Instead, it takes its toll gradually on the enterprise’s adaptability, morale, and customer loyalty, which corrupt the entire financial engine of the company.

The right size for a business unit will obviously depend on the specifics of the kind of business in question. The determining factor is the ease with which a single employee, especially the manager, can fully understand the machinations of the entire business unit. Mr. Leonard uses the term “human-scale” to describe this size of business. He has also called them the “most powerful tool” Constellation has at its disposal for fostering organic growth. When a business is small enough, it is possible for everybody to know nearly everybody else, to know who the customers are, and understand how their work fits into the broader whole. When an employee makes a decision, they can therefore comprehend not just its first-order effects, but its secondary and other derivative effects too. Even more importantly, it is also more humane. When we can associate a face and personal relationship with our colleagues and customers, we naturally harbor accountability and empathy towards them.

Consequently, one question I like to ask company managements is how small they will allow their business units to be. Given the lust for “economies of scale” by analysts, investors, and peers alike, this quite often catches them off guard. They usually answer in terms of dollars rather than employees, even though I almost always ask for the latter if I specify at all. That probably reveals something about their mindset, but that’s a discussion for another time. By far the most common determinant I hear for the minimum viable business unit size is management time. “It isn’t worth our Division President’s time to be overseeing a business with less than $X in revenue” is the usual refrain. This kind of thinking strikes me as letting the tail wag the dog. Instead of demanding that the businesses scale to accommodate management, perhaps management should scale to accommodate the businesses.

Decentralized businesses might answer my question with similar reasoning, but the key difference is that their very structure imposes a check on the tendency for too much power to centralize under one bottlenecked individual. If the company has set up their governance structure right, the building blocks (divisions, business units, etc.) can be easily replicated (rather than being “scaled”). The argument that everything must remain centralized under a particular individual ceases to have credibility.

Similar to Constellation, it would seem to me that the niche, high-margin, asset-light digital businesses that comprise J2 should be profitable at a fairly small size. Putting numbers to it, Constellation’s $3.6B in revenue across 300+ Business Units implies an average size of under $12 million, which is tiny by any standard. J2’s $1.4B in revenue across 13 business units, on the other hand, implies an average size of roughly $100 million. This is no coincidence. As a policy, J2 only forms a new business unit when there is a “path” to at least $100 million in revenues. That might mean a business  unit’s minimum initial size could be something like $50 million, so long as there is runway to eventually hit the $100 million mark via organic or inorganic means:

>“Within our structure, we need those smaller business units to become larger. The goal in J2 is that really every business unit should be $100 million or greater in revenue. That just scales well from a management perspective. It's appropriate for the Division President then to be spending that amount of time with the business unit of that size and the opportunities they can take on.” – Scott Turicchi, J2 Global CFO (UBS Global Tech Conference, Nov 2018)

Constellation sets an extreme standard, even for decentralized companies. It will even proactively split its business units into smaller units if they suspect bloat is setting in. I think there is plenty of room to skew towards larger businesses than theirs while still reaping the entrepreneurial benefits of  decentralization. For that reason, I have no strong objection to J2’s self-imposed goal of creating $100+ million business units. Compared to the average public company, that is still fairly small (an average unit would likely be at the low end of small cap territory if it traded independently). Along that same line of thought, management has already mentioned their willingness to one day spin off business units if they reach sufficient size. However, at the risk of reading too much into these off-the-cuff comments, I worry when I hear J2’s CFO say that the fixed time of three individuals (i.e. the Division Presidents) determines the size at which a business will matter. To repeat what I said above: instead of demanding that the businesses scale to accommodate management, perhaps management should scale to accommodate the businesses. If Constellation can figure out how to
successfully manage over 300 businesses with six Division20 Presidents, J2 should be able handle plenty more than 13 with the three they already have (more on how to accomplish this in the ensuing section).

## Decentralize the M&A Process

> “So the biggest thing that we've embarked on, I think, since the beginning is decentralization. So if you dial back the clock 20, 25 years or at the  beginning, it was Mark and myself prospecting, going out to visit, doing the diligence, going through the acquisitions. Very quickly, we saw that there is no way that we could scale in terms of making a larger number of acquisitions. So we pushed that down to the Operating Groups and the Operating Groups had their own central M&A operations as well... And then what happened was they got too big. And they saw that from the Operating Group level, it slowed things down if everything was done centrally from the Operating Group. And so that was broken down even further and pushed down into portfolio managers who had big, big groups who started hiring more prospectors, M&A people and legal staff as well.” -Bernard Anzarouth, [[Constellation Software]] CIO (2020 AGM)

It is often said that capital allocation is a CEO’s most important job. Right or wrong, this “conventional wisdom” has no doubt provided cover for the widespread centralization of capital allocation and inflation of egos around the C-Suite. This tendency is common even among decentralized businesses despite their general wariness of centralization. There are two reasons for this. First, there is a stereotype (mistaken in my view), that executives with “operational” backgrounds are bad at capital allocation and cannot be easily taught it. Second, capital allocation is significantly scalable with little-to-no incremental labor or resources. However, there is no free lunch. 

For acquisitions in particular, the prospecting, travel, due diligence, negotiating, underwriting, and eventual integration of a business, are extremely labor-intensive. A small team can responsibly handle only so many. Scaling capital allocation without scaling the team therefore requires larger transactions, which eventually erodes returns and heightens risk. The sensible thing to do is return an increasingly larger percentage of capital to shareholders as a company traverses the path to maturity. But alas, the largest and riskiest deals are the most alluring to the C-suite egos. Decentralized businesses, which tend not to rely on large synergies in their acquisition underwriting, thankfully seem to be less easily seduced and more willing to return to shareholders what is theirs. 

There is another option though, and it is one that decentralized businesses are uniquely equipped to take – decentralize capital allocation. This requires a strategic decision to acquire more businesses rather than larger ones. This works well for [[serial acquirers]] operating in markets with thousands of niche independent businesses, but especially well if the supply of those niche businesses is growing. Vertical market software is a great example. The enormous growth in venture capital and the falling costs of computing over the past decade has led to an explosion of new software companies. The vast majority will not live up to the lofty aspirations of their founders and VC backers, but many will still mature into small yet profitable businesses. Ever-larger cohorts of such software companies continue to work their way down the pike and will eventually be looking for a more permanent ownership solution. Something similar could also be said of the digital media and internet-related tech businesses in which J2 traffics.

For an M&A strategy that prioritizes volume over size, maximizing the reach of prospect coverage is imperative. Investors who closely follow Constellation know that management is constantly bemoaning how much better its transaction coverage should be, even as they acquire upwards of 100 software companies per year. To scale such an operation is no simple task. As Mr. Anzarouth describes above, Constellation has managed to do so by allowing a kind of Russian-doll structure to organically develop wherein human-scale M&A teams get continually replicated as the organization grows. In this way, the six Operating Groups (i.e. Divisions, in J2’s parlance) have effectively become mini-Constellations themselves, which in turn harbor even smaller Constellations. As this slide from Corum illustrates, it is
through the Operating Groups and the business units that comprise them – not the head office – that the vast majority of Constellation’s acquisitions are executed.

When done right, pushing capital allocation into the peripheries of the organization kills many birds with one stone. It keeps returns high by biasing towards smaller acquisitions, it lowers integration risk because operating managers are leading many of the acquisitions, it expands prospect coverage, and it self-perpetuates:

>“You have one business unit manager, and if they can buy an equivalent business in the next 3 to 5 years and coach it to perform as well as the one that they're currently running, then all of my M&A problems go away. All of my integration problems go away, and it becomes an organization where you just need the ability to reach into the occasional faltering business unit and provide coaching or sometimes replacement managers. But for the most part, it's self-managing and self-maintaining.” -Mark Leonard, [[Constellation Software]] CEO (Q3 2015 Earnings Call)

Another benefit of structuring an organization for a large number of acquisitions is that it can begin to utilize the law of large numbers. Hundreds of repetitions build more certainty – over valuation, talent assessment, technology quality, and all the other relevant factors. The M&A program becomes increasingly objective, evidence-based, and repeatable. Anyone with a check book can close an acquisition, but it would take years to replicate something like the specialized dataset and the organizational experience Constellation has accumulated over the past 25 years. As the saying goes,
practice makes perfect. 

Of all the changes that have been since Vivek Shah became CEO of J2, the ones surrounding the M&A program are some of the most encouraging. J2 has always been very acquisitive, but when I ask about its prior M&A practices, phrases like “less structured”, “less formal”, and “less process” are the ones that keep coming up. Under its new VP of Corporate Development, Sean Alford, process has been beefed up and personnel has significantly changed. In just the past year, the number of investment professionals has tripled. At J2’s first ever Investor Day earlier this year, Mr. Alford went into great detail on the company’s newly-renovated M&A program. What he
described was a structure that has a clear resemblance to Constellation’s, with M&A programs cascading throughout the organization.

> “Each division has its own M&A program. Each business unit has its own M&A program and the J2 parent has its own M&A program. These all feed into my team, which shepherds deals through the process with Vivek and Scott and ultimately the Board, making capital allocation decisions. In total, we have 30 executives or more at J2, who spend a meaningful part of their time on sourcing M&A.” -Sean Alford, J2 Global SVP of Corporate Development (2020 Investor Day)

One key difference is that J2 has a kind of “buddy system” in which the General Manager of a business unit needs to recruit a cosponsor from the central team of analysts (or vice versa if the analyst sourced it) to move a deal to consummation. In this way, all acquisitions at J2 are still centrally coordinated. However, this structure is set up nicely to allow future decentralization. If a particular President or General Manager develops a strong acquisition track record and a rapport with a particular analyst or two, it would be a smooth transition to set up his own dedicated and more independent M&A team at the division or business unit level when the time comes. This is, after all, how Constellation replicates its own human-scale M&A teams. If J2 does not go down this path, I worry that as the organization grows, the capital allocation team will eventually become too bloated and bureaucratic, thereby making a strategy of smaller, programmatic acquisitions untenable. For now, with just 13 business units, the current system seems plenty adequate with the potential for replication. 

Decentralizing M&A capital allocation can allow for a variety of different styles and sub-strategies to flourish, but this is all for naught if underwriting standards erode. One of the most common refrains you hear from Constellation, its former employees, and other software acquirers is that they are exceptionally disciplined over how much they are willing to pay to buy a business. The company does not discuss what their specific IRR hurdles are, but a former M&A Director described a typical deal as follows: buy a roughly breakeven business at less than 2x recurring revenue and improve margins to ~25%. This typically translated to an ex post purchase price of 5x EBITDA within two years. J2 is identical in this regard as it also targets a 5x effective purchase price within the first two years.

## Restraint with Synergies

>“Shareholders sometimes ask why we don’t pursue economies of scale by centralising functions such as Research & Development and Sales & Marketing. My personal preference is to instead focus on keeping our business units small, and the majority of the decision making down at the business unit level. Partly this is a function of my experience with small high performance teams when I was a venture capitalist, and partly it is a function of seeing that most vertical markets have several viable competitors who exhibit little correlation between their profitability and relative scale.” – Mark Leonard, [[Constellation Software]] CEO (2014 President’s Letter)

Committing to a model of human-scale business units means that there will be many people with the same job function across the organization. One of the main reasons we so rarely see companies with hundreds of autonomous business units is the allure of the quick cost synergies that can be harvested by eliminating these supposedly duplicative roles and combining operations. For many acquisitive companies, these kinds of cost savings are the most important driver of their M&A underwriting. Decentralized businesses, especially those that acquire already-robust businesses, know that in the long run, this can kill the golden goose.

Every acquisition requires some degree of integration. In decentralized businesses, the most invasive integrations happen with the smallest acquisitions at the lowest levels of the organization. At smaller sizes, a more invasive integration is more manageable because the acquired business is simpler and there are fewer people involved (i.e. human-scale). The risk to the broader enterprise is also more limited if it goes awry. The C-suite does not get involved at this level unless asked because the manager who will have responsibility for the acquired business going forward should have the primary say over how it is molded into his existing operations. As the size of the acquisition increases and becomes more complex, the lighter the integration is likely to be. 

This approach to integration and synergies is a total inversion of typical corporate behavior. It is all too common to see self-important (and poorly incentivized) CEOs push for large, splashy acquisitions for all the wrong reasons. Tantalizingly huge synergy estimates are dangled in front of analysts while the integration costs are relegated to the footnotes. Yet it always seems to be the synergies that are overestimated, and the integration costs that are underestimated.

Philosophically, J2’s new business unit structure seems to make space for “redundancies” in the interest of accountability and entrepreneurialism: 

>So we have a little over a dozen general managers who are each in charge of very specific business units who have full P&L responsibility and own all aspects of their enterprise. They own product. They own engineering. They own monetization. They own the business. I view each of them as essentially backable CEOs, to use a private equity parlance. – Vivek Shah, J2 Global CEO (Q4 2018 Earnings Call)

Business units at both Constellation and J2 still usually have some amount of shared services at the Operating Group/Division level (i.e. the next level up; there are three and six of them, respectively). These are generally confined to functions like accounting, legal, HR, and perhaps some R&D. Assessing the right amount of shared services is one of the most challenging judgments I routinely make while studying decentralized businesses (and merits a more fulsome discussion in a future letter).

Special attention should be paid to the head office, because that is where the threat of centralization is greatest. In studying J2, I noticed that the company recently created the Chief Technology Officer and Global Head of HR roles. As far as I can tell, neither role exists at Constellation’s head office. In fact, there appear to be no global function heads other than the CEO, CFO, COO, and CIO. It behooves me to harbor some wariness over the presence of these new roles at J2 corporate, but they are not necessarily damning. Many decentralized businesses lack them, but I have also seen global CTO and HR functions be used to good effect when those roles are circumscribed to the right responsibilities. For example, a corporate HR role that exists as a resource to help with recruiting and training can be useful to the business units, but if they lose the autonomy to construct their own teams in the manner they see fit, it would be better for that role to not exist at all.

Similarly, a global CTO can be quite valuable in helping the disparate business units coordinate for better pricing on certain commonly used technologies (on an opt-in basis), collating KPIs via a business intelligence system, or ensuring cybersecurity standards. A destructive use would be to unilaterally impose a certain technology stack across all the business units, except perhaps in very limited circumstances. Constellation’s COO specifically cautions against this kind of centralization in the R&D function because it imposes homogeneity on a very diverse client base that expects products meeting very specific niche needs.

>“We do get our heads of R&D together, I'd say, at least once a year, usually at sort of a summit... We just try to allow them to sort of connect with each other and see what each other is doing, if they think they can learn from each other. So there is really no encouragement to follow one path or the other. Because as soon as we do that, we will then own the responsibility as to what that path is, and that's a big job to take on. I wouldn't want to be the one recommending which platforms we should use for dozens or hundreds of business units across the world that are all in different situations, with different customer bases, with different needs, some with many, many users, some that are tools that are used by few users.”
– Mark Miller, [[Constellation Software]] COO (2020 AGM)

Mr. Miller’s comments also underscore the core underlying ethos of decentralization – responsibility. Centralization distances decision-making from its real economic consequences. When things go awry, the finger-pointing game is all too predictable: management blames “execution” of the front line and restructures while the disillusioned front-line blames management for being “out-of-touch”. Both are right. Management is quite literally out-of-touch, while those on the front-line are not going to feel responsible when they are powerless to exercise meaningful discretion.

## Evidenced-Based Coaching

>“So in the first few months of ownership with the new BU, you tend to spend a lot of time on education around our metrics, comparing the business you buy to what other operating companies are doing within CSI. And the obvious next question for acquired management is they ask you, "How do we achieve those metrics?"...And 80% of the time, management buys in. They make the changes. The business improves, and then your time spent with that management team becomes less and less over time. You tend to change your focus to other areas. And in the rare circumstance, the management team doesn't buy into it, you tend to have to move into the situation where you change 1 or 2 people in order to make the changes that are necessary.” – John Billowits, Vela Operating Group CEO (2015 Constellation AGM)

Decentralization biases towards non-interference so long as a business is on the right track, but the moment of acquisition is an opportune time to put it on that right track. Some decentralized acquirers will have a greater appetite for turnarounds than others, but they tend to be universally cautious about disruptive synergy strategies like mass layoffs and consolidating operations. Instead, they gravitate towards a strategy of coaching the acquired business to improvement.

Best practice in this approach entails the setting of a concise set of clear financial targets and benchmarks that are informed by the collective experience of all the other business units in the company (and competitors too, if the data is available). Business unit managers are rewarded for achieving their targets, but risk losing their job if they underperform too much for too long. How they achieve these goals is, critically, their call. It is the job of a Division/Operating Group President not to run any business units themselves, but to empower the General Managers to meet those goals by providing coaching, advice, useful introductions, case studies, the occasional capital investment, and perhaps a limited set of useful shared services.

It is clear that Constellation has embraced this coaching and evidence-based style of management throughout their organization (though different Operating Groups will manifest it differently). The jury is out on J2. The company likes to say that their three Division Presidents should be thought of like operating partners of a private equity firm. That’s all well and good, but operating partner styles are as varied as the private equity firms that employ them. I have at various times heard management characterize J2’s Presidents as being both hands-off and hands-on. When I hear, for example, that products from different business units are being sold in a bundle (e.g. the Humble Bundle gaming subscription bundled with a private VPN service), I wonder whether that decision was driven by the free cooperation of the relevant General Managers, or imposed by a President. Two of the three Presidents were hired within the past two years, so the truth is probably that their management styles are still finding their way.

There are a handful of tactics that decentralized companies seem to commonly present to their acquired businesses to help them improve. One that I’ve seen at both Constellation and J2 (as well as [[TransDigm]], discussed in a previous letter (See [[The Disguises of Short-Termism]])) is pricing strategy. You might think this is code for just “jacking up prices”, but it is more nuanced than that (even if that is sometimes the outcome). At Constellation, a very strong priority is placed on [[recurring revenues]], with corresponding KPIs. This could mean raising prices, but it also probably means changing practices that directly impact churn, “firing” bad customers, and potentially reducing one-off consultancy or custom-development work. One should also remember that at the size of business at which Constellation acquires, many will have been founder-led since inception and lack any kind of sophisticated market intelligence. They could be totally clueless that their pricing is out-of-whack with the rest of the market.

At J2, there is a similar prioritization of [[recurring revenues]]. A tried-and-true page from their playbook is to acquire a digital business that is dependent on display advertisements (i.e. pay-per-eyeball) and diversify its monetization with a greater mix of performance advertising (i.e. per-per-click) or subscriptions. The best example of this is the aforementioned Ookla, whose Speedtest website and app not only shifted from display to performance advertising, but even built an enterprise data subscription service for telecom providers after it was acquired.

Whether it is a financial target, a pricing strategy, or some other tactic, having a body of collective evidence to support it eliminates excuses about unfair treatment or unreasonable goals. Even better, it plays off the healthy competitiveness of entrepreneurs who will look around at his peers and think “If they can do it, so can I. In fact, I can do better.” I have been told by executives at numerous decentralized businesses that the desire to be at the top of the group’s KPI league tables (or escape the bottom) is almost universally a more powerful incentive for the business managers than the financial rewards themselves.

## Shareholder Stewardship

>“Last year I asked the board to reduce my salary to zero and to lower my bonus factor. CSI had a great year, so despite those modifications, my total compensation actually increased. This year I'll take no salary, no incentive compensation, and I am no longer charging any expenses to the company. I've been the President of CSI for its first 20 years. I have waived all compensation because I don't want to work as hard in the future as I did during the last 20 years. Cutting my compensation will allow me to lead a more balanced life, with a less oppressive sense of personal obligation. I'm paying my own expenses for a different reason. I've traditionally travelled on economy tickets and stayed at modest hotels because I wasn't happy freeloading on the CSI shareholders and I wanted to set a good example for the thousands of CSI employees who travel every month. I'm getting older and wealthier and find that I'm willing to trade more of my own cash for comfort, convenience, and speed ... so I’m afraid you’ll mostly see me in the front of the plane from here on out.” – Mark Leonard, [[Constellation Software]] CEO (2014 President’s Letter)

Seven years before making this announcement, Mr. Leonard remarked that the reason he always flew coach despite the ease with which first class could be justified (not least of which was his 6’5”, 280lb frame!) came down to a principle that “the standard we use when we spend our shareholders’ money is even more stringent than that which we use when we are spending our own.” The importance of shareholder stewardship is obviously not specific to [[serial acquirers]] or decentralization, but I am compelled to discuss it for this comparison between Constellation and J2 for reasons I am about to make clear. I want to baseline with Mr. Leonard’s comments, even though they are a clear departure from the norm. I do think that decentralization, wherein responsibilities are pushed away from the head office, more naturally cultivates an ethos of service in the C-suite and attracts people who share Mr. Leonard’s sensibilities. Conversely, centralization breeds entitlement amongst executives who amass power around themselves. This brings me to the most concerning aspect of J2 for an investor today.

J2’s current CEO, Vivek Shah, is relatively new to the job, having been appointed at the start of 2018. Leading up to his promotion, he ran Ziff Davis for eight years (two years after purchasing it out of bankruptcy himself, and another six years under J2’s ownership). Mr. Shah’s predecessor is Hemi Zucker, one of J2’s original employees who was appointed CEO in 2008. In his decade as CEO, J2’s stock outperformed the S&P 500 by a good margin so at least by that measure, he did a good job. I doubt I will ever get the unadulterated version of the story, but my understanding of the CEO change
was that the Board, though content with Mr. Zucker’s leadership to date, simply thought that Mr. Shah was a more talented executive, had a more compelling strategic vision, and had aspirations to be a public company CEO in the near future. Whether this was the Board’s thinking or not, I would have made the same assessment and decision.

However, instead of doing what you would expect – giving Mr. Zucker a nice severance package and well wishes – the Board chose to do something that was both highly unorthodox and a major red flag. When J2 announced the leadership change, it also announced that it would be making a $200 million commitment to the inaugural fund of a recently created venture capital firm called OCV Partners founded by J2’s Chairman, Richard Ressler. Additionally, Mr. Zucker would be joining this firm as a partner. For some context on materiality, J2 was generating approximately $300 million in annual free cash flow at the time. J2 wound up being the largest investor in this fund by far. Only $60 million was raised from other investors. The company line is that OCV is a way for J2 to participate in earlier stage non-control investments that are outside of its core strategy, as well as a friendly party to whom J2 can pass along such deals when they inevitably arise in its own acquisition pipeline. However, any objective outside observer can see this for what it plainly is: cronyism.

The recently circulated short thesis on J2 that I mentioned earlier is, like many of the others I have read, sloppy and full of specious arguments, but it is right to excoriate the Board for this tone-deaf and self-serving decision. I am inclined to believe that it was all done by-the-books and double-checked by the lawyers, which only serves as a salient reminder that there is a big difference between following the letter of the law and doing the right thing.

The irony of it all is that Mr. Ressler probably thought this was “doing right” by Mr. Zucker for pushing him out of his position to make way for Mr. Shah. Again, I invite the reader to consider the example set by Mr. Leonard, who not only waived all of his compensation even though shareholders would probably argue that he was, if anything, underpaid, but also now covers his own expenses because he does not want shareholders bearing the cost of first class flights. Does a large investment in the Chairman’s venture capital fund, which is employing the departing CEO, constitute a “more stringent” standard for the shareholders’ money than the Board would use on themselves?

However, there is a positive angle to this story. In the short time Mr. Shah has been CEO, J2 has quietly undergone significant internal changes. Though the company’s headquarters is still officially in Los Angeles were Mr. Zucker, Chairman Ressler, and the old management team were based, the center of gravity of the organization has clearly shifted to New York where Mr. Shah, most of the senior executives, and the M&A team reside. Two of the three Division Presidents were hired after Mr. Shah became CEO, and the third has been Mr. Shah’s lieutenant at Ziff Davis since before it was even owned by J2. Similarly, of the 15 General Managers across J2’s 13 business units, nine were hired after Mr. Shah became CEO. Five of the rest were hired or acquired by Mr. Shah while running the Ziff Davis division. In fact, the core of most of the business units are companies that were acquired in Mr. Shah’s short time as CEO or were directly acquired by him while he was running Ziff Davis. The VP of M&A is also new, the investment team has tripled in the past year, and the acquisition process has been given much more structure. It was also encouraging to see J2 hold their first ever Investor Day in early 2020, which introduced investors to many of these new faces, and provided an unprecedented level of transparency under the hood of the
company. In sum, there has been a dramatic changing-of-the-guard (or draining of the swamp, depending on how you see it).

Still, the questionable Board remains. Mr. Shah was not on the Board at the time of the OCV investment decision but is now. Once again, I can only speculate whether he privately approves of the OCV investment or just swallowed it as part of the grand bargain for the CEO job. If there is any good that can come from short-seller allegations for J2’s shareholders, it is heightened scrutiny on J2’s governance. Personally, I think every board member aside from Mr. Shah and Ms. Sarah Fay, who also joined in 2018, should be replaced. If at all possible, the remaining commitment to OCV should be cancelled. Finally, under no circumstances should J2 purchase any companies from OCV, nor any further capital commitments be made with them.

If J2’s Board and management team wonder why their shares persistently trade at a huge discount to acquisitive aspirational peers like Constellation, I believe they need look no farther than the shady reputation they have invited over time, as most brazenly epitomized by the OCV investment. Investors should hope that with the recent significant management changes and implementation of a more decentralized model, a humbler and more service-oriented ethos begins to flourish.

## Lessons for Demesne
To summarize, here are the major takeaways for Demesne’s research process covered in this letter:
• **Acquisitions of Small, Private Companies.** How large are a company’s typical acquisitions? Does it have a structure in place that can scale the number of transactions without going too far up in size?
• **Counting Business Units.** How many business units (not brands) does the company have? How many does management think they could have in the future? What proportion of acquisitions become their own business units?
- **Human-Scale Business Units**. How big is the typical business unit (in employees, revenue, etc.)? How small is too small, and how big is too big? Do business units regularly get split to maintain focus and nimbleness?
• **Decentralized M&A**. How centralized is the M&A process around the C-suite? What is the team’s transaction volume capacity? How are division and business unit managers involved in prospecting, if at all? Are there multiple concentric M&A teams throughout the organization? At what level of the company are most transactions executed?
• **Synergy Restraint.** Is it the largest or the smallest acquisitions that are subject to the most disruptive integrations?
• **Redundant Functional Roles**. Do acquired companies have mass layoffs? Are roles like R&D, Marketing, Sales, etc. consolidated across business units? What global functional heads, if any, reside at the head office?
• **Evidence-Based Targets and Strategies**. Are the business unit managers given clear financial and KPI targets? Are strategies imposed, or are they suggested based on evidence from other business units? Do the business units have the freedom to hit their targets in their own way?
• **Coaches versus Players**. Do Division/Operating Group Presidents manage more like coaches or players? When different business units collaborate, is it willingly or by imposition?
• **Pricing Strategies Post Acquisition**. Does there tend to be pricing/monetization changes in the business unit post acquisition?
• **Shareholder Stewardship**. Is the standard by which the Board and management spend shareholders’ money more stringent than how they would spend their own? Have there been any major changes in the Board or management team recently?

## Closing Thoughts
Constellation is not a perfect company and is not the right template for all businesses, even decentralized ones. Still, they have clearly done a lot of things right, guided by their wholesale commitment to decentralization.
Contrastingly, it is hard to argue, in my opinion, that J2 should be held up as a role model for anybody at this point in time. The potential is there, and recent changes are encouraging, but its suspect governance casts a long shadow.
Whether J2’s share price sufficiently compensates investors for that risk, or whether Constellation’s share price overcompensates for a modest forward trajectory are judgements I will not opine on here. Instead, I want this letter to underscore that decentralization is about doing great things in small sizes many times over instead of doing one great thing on a massive scale. This is as true for acquisitions as it is for operations but executing on this principle requires much more than a willing check book.
