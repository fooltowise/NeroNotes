In [[Games Theory]], the prisoner's dilemna is a category of two-players' games where both player can either choose to [[Cooperation|cooperate]] or defect.

The payoff structure is always as follows:

|           | Cooperate | Defect |
|:---------:|-----------|--------|
| Cooperate | c/c       | b/a    |
| Defect    | a / b     | d/d    |

Where  the relationship  a > c> d> b always holds.
For instance:
- if prisoner A cooperates and prisoner B defects, A gets a 10 years prison sentence while B is set free
- if A defects and B cooperates, A is set free and B gets a 10 years sentence.
- if both A and B cooperate, they both get  a small 1 year prison sentence.
- if both defects, A and B get a 5 years prison sentence.

If this is a one-off decision, cooperating is a [[Dominated Strategy]] and both players are incentivized to defect. The result is suboptimal.

However, when there is a non-negligible probability that the game will be repeated, we fall into an iterated instance of the prisoner's dilemna and players are better off cooperating. 

Robert Axelrod has showed that in a iterated prisoner's dilemna, a [[Tit for Tat]] strategy is often optimal: players start cooperating at the first round and afterward play whatever the other player did on the previous round.
