## The board's role: not what you think
- Who's on board, and how long do they stay? -> Two to three corporate executive, the rest being outside (or "independent") directors. In practice, there is no cap to how long a director mandate can last, except when shareholders stop electing them.
- Board members are first appointed, and then elected at the shareholders' meeting
- Board directors are there to oversee the company on behalf of all shareholders. BUT oversight is very different from operations: boards don't run the company.
- Board oversight has two core functions:
	- hire/fire the CEO
	- agree on corporate strategy together with management, then ensure that tactically the company is executing on this strategy
- Three different standing board committees (only independent directors):
	- Compensation committee
	- Nominating and governance committee
	- Audit committee


For small caps, it is really important to have capital market expertise at the board level, otherwise it is very likely that rounds of financing will be done at very disadvantageous terms, which will destroy a lot of value. Absent this, it is better to focus on companies that don't need to raise capital.

It is good to have one or several directors who have experience operating a business in the same industry, where the size is 3-10 times bigger than the small cap.

When the board is not great, it is better to initiate a smaller position than usual.

Good board members should own stock. For small cap companies, they should not have a large cash compensation. No board member should make a living by being a board member of a company.


## What Great boards do

#### Â 1. Executive sessions
Great boards are constantly in touch without the CEO being present, in order to discuss industry updates, competitors, etc.

#### 2. Share ownership guidelines
Great boards require board members to be equity holders.
#### 3. Trade shows
It is also a good practice for board members to attend their industry trade shows. Great board members know that they cannot possibly oversee corporate strategies that they don't understand.

#### 4. Diligence assignments

High performing boards assign each board member a particular peer or competitor, and then that board member is required to update the full board on that company's progress.

#### 5.  Setup CEO to succeed

#### 6. Hear directly from investors and employees

Great boards will also occasionally attend investor meetings with the CEO so they can hear investor concerns. They also routinely meet with employees without the CEO present (but with his approval).

#### 7. Encourage underperforming directors to move on


## Practically Assessing a small cap board
#### Analyzing board composition

The board need to comport expert members who understand:
- the key strategic resources of the company
- the key enterprise risks that face the company
- the key customers or verticals that the company is focused upon

#### Objectivity vs Independence

Companies don't actively disclose that directors are pals with the CEO. You need objective directors.  You need to be careful about commonalities with the CEO. (Common school attended? Common companies in their bio? Commonalities on LinkedIn? Other boards where director and CEO serve together?) Also ask investor relations if any board members have ever worked together before or served on any private company board together?

#### Stock Ownership
Do the board members own stock?

#### Tenure
When board members are there for more than ten years, it often become more challenging to be fiercely objective and proactive in their oversight on behalf of their shareholders.

#### Overboarding/ Time commitments
Being on the board of more than three public companies means that your company is probably not getting enough of attention from that particular director.

#### Website
No board member bio on the website often means that governance is not really a high priority for the company.


#### CEO/CFO
Are board members former CEO/CFOs? There is no evidence that former CEO/CFOs are good board members. if they are still CEOS/CFOs somewhere, ask how much time they have to dedicate to your company.

#### Large cap backgrounds

#### Board leadership
If the CEO is inexperienced, it will be a great advantage to have a chairman or a leading director who has a lot of experience in a successful small cap business.

#### Celebrities
history suggest that celebrities board members are usually not a good thing for shareholders. Do this person really has the requisite time to serve on the board or is it a PR stunt?

#### What to look at in an annual proxy
- Who are the board members?
- What is their background?
- Why does management think that they are a good choice?
- What is their compensation?
- Conflict of interest?
- ...



**Ideally board members purchase stock with their own capital, i.e they are not granted stock.**
