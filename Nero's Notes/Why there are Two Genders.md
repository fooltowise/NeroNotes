# Why There Are Only Two Genders

When a sperm fertilizes an egg it donates just one thing to that egg, a bag full of genes called a nucleus. The rest of it stays outside the egg. But a few of the father's genes are left behind, because they are not in the nucleus at all; they are in little structures called organelles.

There are two main kinds of organelles; mitochondria, which use oxygen to extract energy out of food, and chloroplasts (in plants), which use sunlight to make food out of air and water. These organelles are almost certainly the descendants of bacteria that lived inside cells and were 'domesticated' because their biochemical skills were of use to the host cells. Being descendants of free-living bacteria, they came with their own genes, and they still have many of these genes. Human mitochondria, for example, have thirty-seven genes of their own. 

**To ask 'Why are there two genders?' is to ask 'Why are organelles genes inherited through the maternal line?'**

Why not just let the sperm's organelles into the egg too? Evolution seems to have gone to extraordinary lengths to keep the father's organelles out. In plants a narrow constriction prevents the father's organelles from passing into the pollen tube. In animals the sperm is given a sort o strip search as it enters the egg, to remove all the organelles. Why should this be?

The answer lies in the exception to this rule: an alga called *Chlamydomomas* that has two genders called plus and minus rather than male and female. In this species, the two parents' chloroplasts engage in a war of attrition that destroys ninety-five per cent of them. The five per cent left standing are those of the plus parent, which by force of sheer numbers overwhelm the minus ones. This war impoverishes the whole cell. 

The nuclear genes take the same dim view of it as the prince takes in Romeo and Juliet of the war between two of his subjects:

*Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
Profaners of this neighbor-stained steel - 
Will they not hear? What ho! - you men, you beasts, 
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins!
On pain of torture, from these bloody hands
Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground
And hear the sentence of your moved Prince.
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word
By thee, Old Capulet, and Montague, 
Have thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets
...
If ever you disturb our streets again,
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.*

Romeo and Juliet, Act I, Scene I

As the prince soon discovers, even this severe sentence is insufficient to suppress the quarrel. Had he followed the example of the nuclear genes, he would have killed all the Montagues. The nuclear genes of both father and mother between them arrange that the organelles of the male are slaughtered. It is an advantage (to the male nucleus, not the male organelles) to be of the type that allows its organelles to be killed, so that a viable offspring results. So owners of docile, suicidal organelles (in the minus gender) would proliferate. Soon, any deviation from a ratio of fifty-fifty killers and victims would benefit the rarer type and cause the ratio to correct itself. Two genders have been invented, killer which provides the organelles, and victim which does not.

Laurence Hurst of Oxford uses these arguments to predict that two genders are a consequence of sex-by-fusion. That is, where sex consists of the fusion of two cells, as in *Chlamydomonas* and most animals and plants, you find two genders. Where it consists of conjugation - the formation of a pipe between the two cells and the transfer of a nucleus of genes down the pipe - and there is no fusion of cells, then there is no conflict and no need for killer and victim genders. Sure enough, in those species with sex-by-conjugation, such as ciliated protozoa and mushrooms, there are may tens of different genders. In those species with sex-by-fusion, there are almost invariably two genders. 

### Safe sex tips for sperm

Along with most of the animal and plant kingdoms, we practice fusion sex and we have two genders. But it is a much modified from of fusion sex. Males do not submit their organelles to be slaughtered; they leave them behind at the border. The sperm carries just a nucleus cargo, a mitochondrial engine and a flagellum propeller. The sperm-making cells go to great lengths to strip off the rest of the cytoplasm before the sperm is complete and redigest it at some expense. Even the propeller and engine are jettisoned when the sperm meets the egg; only the nucleus travels further.

Hurst explains this by raising once again the matter of disease. Organelles are not the only rebels inside cells. Bacteria and viruses are there as well. And exactly the same logic applies to them as to organelles. When cells fuse, the rival bacteria in each engage in a struggle to the death. If a bacterium living happily inside an egg suddenly finds its patch invaded by a rival carried by a sperm it will have to compete and that might well mean abandoning its latency and manifesting itself as disease.

If it pays a parasite to go for broke when a rival appears, then it pays a host to prevent cross-infection with two strains of parasite. And nowhere is the risk of cross-infection greater than during sex. A sperm fusing with an egg risks bringing its cargo of bacteria and viruses as well; their arrival would awaken the egg's own parasites and cause a battle for possession that would leave the egg sick or dead. To avoid this, therefore, the sperm tries to avoid bringing into the egg material that might harbor bacteria or viruses. It passes just the nucleus into the egg. Safe sex indeed.

### Decision Time

Gender, then, was invented as a way to resolve the conflict between the cytoplasmic genes of the two parents. Rather than let such conflict destroy the offspring, a sensible agreement was reached: all the cytoplasmic genes would come from the mother, none from the father.  Since this made the father's gametes smaller, they could specialize in being more numerous and mobile, the better to find eggs. gender is a bureaucratic solution to an antisocial habit.

This explains why there are two genders, one with small gametes, the other one with large ones. But it does not explain why every creature cannot have both genders on board. Why are people not hermaphrodites? Were I a plant, the question might not arise: most plants are hermaphrodites. There is a general pattern for mobile creatures to be dioecious (with separate genders) and sessile creatures like plants and barnacles to be hermaphroditic. Given that pollen is lighter than seed, a flower that produces only seed can have only local offspring. One that also produces pollen can father plants that spread far and wide. A law of diminishing returns applies to seed but not to pollen.

But it does not explain why animals took a different route. The answer lies in those muttering organelles left behind at the gate when the sperm entered the egg. In a male any gene in an organelle is a cul-de-sac, because it will be left behind in the sperm. All of the organelles in your body and all of the genes in them cam from your mother, none came from your father. this is bad news for the genes, whose life's work, remember, is to pass into the next generation. Every man is a dead end for organelles genes. Not surprisingly, there is a temptation for such genes to invent solutions to their difficulty (i.e, those that do solve the problem spread at the expense of those that do not). The most attractive solution for an organelle gene in a hermaphrodite is to divert all of the owner's resources into female reproduction and away from male.

This is not pure fantasy. Hermaphrodites are in a state of constant battle against rebellious organelle genes trying to destroy their male parts. Male-killer genes have been found in more than a hundred and forty species of plant. They grow flowers but the male anthers are stunted or withered: seed but no pollen is produced.

Invariably the cause of this sterility is a gene that lies inside an organelle, not a nuclear gene. By killing the anthers, the rebellious gene diverts more of the plant's resources into female seed, through which it can be inherited. The nucleus has no such bias towards females; indeed if the rebels are achieving their aims in many members of the species, the nucleus would benefit greatly from being the only plant on the block capable of producing pollen. So wherever they appear, male sterility genes are soon blocked by nuclear fertility-restorers. In maize, for example, there are two male-sterility organelle genes, each suppressed by a separate nuclear restorer.

In tobacco there are no less than eight such pairs of genes. By hybridizing different strains of maize, plant breeders can release the male-sterile genes from nuclear suppression, because the suppressor from one parent no longer recognizes the rebel from the other. They wish to do this because a field of male-sterile maize cannot  fertilize itself. By planting a different, male-fertile strain among it, the breeders can collect hybrid seed. An hybrid seed, benefiting from the mysterious boost known as hybrid vigor, yields more than both its parents. Male-sterile/female-sterile strains of sunflower, sorghum, cabbage, tomato, maize, and other crops are a mainstay of farmers all over the world.

It is easy to spot if male-sterile genes are at work. The plants have two types: hermaphrodites and female. Such populations of plants are known as gynodioecious; androdioecious plants, with males and hermaphrodites only, are almost unknown.  In wild thyme, for instance, about half the plants are usually female, the other half hermaphrodites.
