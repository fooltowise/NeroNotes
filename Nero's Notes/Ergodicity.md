# Ergodicity

In mathematics and probability theory, ergodicity is a property of a variable. We say that a phenomenon is ergodic if its behavior from a ensemble perspective converge with its behavior from a time-series perspective.
**A system is ergodic if its population outcome coincides with the lifetime outcome of each of its components. Otherwise, it is non-ergodic.**

Is it the same to do one experiment one 1'000 different subjects (ensemble perspective), or to do the same experiment 1'000 times in a row on the same subject (time series perspective)?

According to Nassim Taleb, you have ergodicity when there is no absorbing state. 
**Any time there is an irreversible consequence, the situation is not ergodic.**

**Irreversibility absorbs future gains.**

For instance, Russian roulette is not ergodic:
- if six players play once Russian roulette, on average 1/6 of the players will be dead
- if one player has to play six time in a row Russian roulette, on average 100% of the players will be dead

Death is the ultimate absorbing state.


You can only rely on expected outcomes if you are guaranteed a large number of repetitions. Otherwise, they are misleading (the Law of Large Numbers requires a large number of repetitions).
