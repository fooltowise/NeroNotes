# Munger's Comments on [[Berkshire Hathaway]]

### Berkshire is a hell of a business
We're like the hedgehog that only knows one big thing: if you can generate float (cash from insurance premiums that Berkshire can invest before claims must be paid) at three percent and invest it in businesses that generate thirteen percent, that's a pretty good business.

The businesses that Berkshire has acquired will return thirteen percent pretax on what we paid for them, maybe more. With a cost of capital of three percent - generated via other people's money in the form of float - that's a hell of a business. That's the reason Berkshire shareholders needn't totally despair. Berkshire is not as good as it was in terms of percentage compounding (going forward), but it's still a hell of a business.

I hate to be an optimist, but we have really added a lot of wonderful businesses to Berkshire over the past few years.

### Berkshire's past returns
Berkshire's past record has been almost ridiculous. If Berkshire had used even half the leverage of, say, Rupert Murdoch, it would be five times its current size.

### Berkshire's future outlook
One of the smartest things a person can do is dampen investment expectations, especially with Berkshire. That would be mature and responsible. I like our model, and we should do nicely.
The future will be harder for [[Berkshire Hathaway]] for two reasons:
1. We're so big. It limits our investment options to more competitive areas that are examined by very smart people like Alice Schroeder (the insurance analyst from Paine Webber and then Morgan Stanley, who was sitting in the audience).
2. The current climate offers prospects in common stocks over the next fifteen to twenty years that are way less than we've experience over the past fifteen to twenty years. Read Warren's *Fortune* article - I totally agree with it ("Mr Buffett on the stock market, 11/22/99")

[[Berkshire Hathaway]]'s value will be higher in twenty years, but it is certain that the annual rate of percentage growth will be much lower. But this is not a tragedy. We're content. [[Berkshire Hathaway]] and Wesco will accumulate cash every year, and we have a structure that gives us enormous flexibility. While we're too big to buy the stock of a small company, we have the advantage of having entire companies offered to us. Something has always turned up for us. I'm not discouraged, but I don't think your money here is going to do anything like what you're use to.

It's a finite and very competitive world. All large aggregations of capital eventually find it hell on earth to grow and thus find a lower rate of return.

Personally, I think Berkshire will be a lot bigger and stronger than it is. Whether the stock will be a good investment from today's price is another question. The one thing we've always guaranteed is that the future will be a lot worse than the past. The future returns of Berkshire and Wesco won't be as good in the future as they have been in the past. This is true of all large, successful companies. The only difference is that we'll tell you.

### [[Berkshire Hathaway]]'s culture
Our culture is very old-fashioned, like Ben Franklin's or Andrew Carnegie's. Can you imagine Carnegie hiring consultants? It's amazing how well this approach still works. A lot of the businesses we buy are kind of cranky and old-fashioned like us.
For many of our shareholders, our stock is all they own, and we're acutely aware of that. Our culture of conservatism runs very deep.
This is an amazingly sound place. We are more disaster-resistant than most other places. We haven't pushed it as hard as other people would have pushed it.
I'm happy having ninety percent of my net worth in Berkshire stock. We're going to try to compound it at a reasonable rate without taking unreasonable risk or using leverage. If we can't do this, then that's just too damn bad.

### Berkshire and Wesco's stock prices
We like the stocks of both Berkshire and Wesco to trade within hailing distance of what we think  of as intrinsic value. When it runs up, we try to talk it down. That's not all common in Corporate America, but that's the way we act.
Today, it seems to be regarded as the duty of CEOs to make the stock go up. This leads to all sorts of foolish behavior. We want to tell it like it is.


I don't want to go back to Go. I've been to Go. A lot of our shareholders have a majority of their net worth in Berkshire, and they don't want to go back to Go either. 

### Berkshire shareholders
We like our current shareholders and don't want to entice anyone to become one. I think our reporting, considering the complexity of the enterprise, is better that of any enterprise I know at giving shareholders the information they need. We do it conscientiously.

### Berkshire's acquisition strategy
Two thirds of acquisitions don't work. Ours work because we don't try to do acquisitions - we wait for no-brainers.

### Competition for acquisitions
We've had private equity competitors for a long time, but one way or another, we've manager to buy quite a few things.
The general assumption is that it must be easy to sit behind a desk and people will bring in one good opportunity after another - this was the attitude in venture capital a few years ago. This was not the case at all for us - we scrounged around for companies to buy. For twenty years, we didn't buy more than one or two per year.
It's fair to say that we were rooting around. There were no commissioned salesmen. Anytime you sit there waiting for a deal to come by, you're in a very dangerous seat.

### Managers of acquired companies
We've bought business after business because we admire the founders and what they've done with their lives. In almost all cases, they've stayed on, and our expectations have not been disappointed.
What matters most: passion or competence that was inborn? Berkshire is full of people who have a peculiar passion for their own business. I would argue passion is more important than brain power.
I don't think our managers who come to this meeting are picking up new tricks - they know all the tricks related to their business - but this is an interesting place and it gets more interesting every year and they like being part of it.

### Managing subsidiaries
By and large, we've chosen people we admire enormously to have the power beneath us. It's easy for us to get along with them on average because we love and admire them. And they create the culture for whatever invention and reality recognition is going on in their business. And included in that reality recognition is the recognition that previous conclusions were incorrect.

There are certain virtues that are common in all of Berkshire's subsidiaries. We don't create them - we select companies that have them already. We just don't screw it up. We have decentralized power to a point just short of total abdication.

It would help current shareholders to hear our CEOs of the Berkshire subsidiaries, but we promised them they could spend one hundred percent of their time on their business. We place no impediments on them running their businesses. Many have expressed to me how happy they are that they don't have to spend twenty five percent of their time on activities they don't like.

### Synergies
The reason we avoid the word "synergy" is because generally people claim more synergistic benefits than will come. Yes, it exists, but there are so many false promises. Berkshire is full of synergies - we don't avoid synergies, just claims of synergies.

### Making the right personnel decisions
It's amazing how few times over the decades we've had to remove a person - far less than other companies. It's not that we're soft or foolish, it's that we're wiser and luckier. most people would look back and say their worst mistake was not firing someone soon enough. We don't say that. Our record is fabulous. We're old-fashioned. For example, in the case of CORT business services ( a furniture rental business that Wesco acquired), Warren said to me "You're going to love Paul Arnold(CORT's CEO)." And he was right. Paul's been running the business since he was in law school and he loves it.

### Berkshire's Insurance Operations
Reinsurance is not as much a commodity business as it might appear. There's such a huge time lag between when a policy is written and when it is paid that the customer has to evaluate the insurer's future willingness and ability to pay. We have a reputational advantage, though it's not as big as it should be.

I do think we get some advantage in reinsurance because people trust our willingness and ability to pay, so it's not a commodity. I think we have some special talents. That being said, I think it's dangerous to rely on special talents - it's better to own lots of monopolistic businesses with unregulated prices. But that's not the world today. We have made money exercising our talents and will continue to do so.

I'm glad we have insurance, though it's not a no-brainer, I'm warning you. We have to be smart to make it work.
The overall result is that we're going to do pretty well - meaning in the top ten percent of the industry - because we do different things and we're willing to do some unpleasant things.

Generally speaking, we're mildly optimistic about our insurance operations.

Growing float at a sizable rate a low cost is almost impossible - but we intend to do it anyway. I've been amazed by the growth and cost of our float. It's wonderful to generate billions of dollars of float at a cost way below Treasury notes.

Lumpy results and being willing to write less insurance business if market conditions are unfavorable... that is one of our advantages as an insurer - we don't give a damn about lumpy results. Every one else is trying to please Wall Street. This is not a small advantage. Nobody else does it, but to me not worrying about trying to please Wall Street is obviously the only way to go. A lot about Berkshire is like this. Being controlling owners is key - it would be hard for a committee to make these kinds of decisions.

### [[Berkshire Hathaway]] repurchasing shares

In the past, when Berkshire has gotten cheap, we've found other even cheaper stocks to buy. I'd always prefer this. It's no fun to have the company so lacking in repute that we can make money for some shareholders by buying out others.

### Splitting Berkshire stock to create more liquidity
I think the notion that liquidity of tradable common stock is a great contributor to capitalism is mostly twaddle. The liquidity gives us these crazy booms, so it has as many problems as virtues.
Berkshire trades at $50 million of stock per day, so very few people will have a problem selling it. But we're trying to create more people who have the problem of owning stock worth so much that liquidity is an issue.

### Why don't more companies and investors copy [[Berkshire Hathaway]]?
It's a good question. Our approach has worked for us. Look at the fun we, our managers, and our shareholders are having. More people should copy us. It's not difficult, but it looks difficult because it's unconventional -  it isn't the way things are normally done. We have low overhead, don't have quarterly goals or budgets or a standard personnel system, and our investing is much more concentrated than is the average. It's simple and common sense.

I was recently speaking with Jack McDonald, who teaches a course on investing rooted in our principles at Stanford Business School. He said it's lonely - like he's the Maytag repairman.
