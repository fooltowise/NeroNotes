# Syntopical Reading

So far, so good. But, until now, we have been learning about how to read *a* book. The highest level of reading, syntopical reading, allows you to synthesize knowledge from a comparative reading of *several* books about the same subject. This is where the real virtue of reading is actualized. Adler and Van Doren explain, "When reading syntopically, the reader reads many books, not just one, and places them in relation to one another and to a subject about which they all revolve. But mere comparison of texts is not enough. Syntopical reading involves more. With the help of the books read, the syntopical reader is able to construct an analysis of the subject *that may not be in any of the books.*"

Syntopical reading, also known as comparative reading, involves reading many books on the same subject and then comparing and contrasting the ideas, insights, and arguments within them. There are five steps to syntopical reading.

First, you must find the right books and then the passages that are most relevant to filling your needs. So the first step is an [[Inspectional Reading]] of all the works that you have identified as relevant.

Second, translate the language of each author into keywords that you choose. For example, bring together all ideas on "margin of safety", as suggested by Buffett, Seth Klarman, Benjamin Graham, and Howard Marks. Don't just search for the exact term; search for all relevant ideas that describe the term. 

Third, frame clear questions that will shed light on the problems you are trying to solve by reading those books. Rather than focusing on the problems the author is trying to solve, you need to focus on the questions that you want answered, like "What is intelligent capital allocation?" or "How do I assess management quality?" It's important to frame the questions in such a way that all or most of the authors can be interpreted as providing answers.

When you ask a good question, you have identified an issue. At this fourth step, you identify the pros and cons of a specific topic that helps you flesh out all sides of an issue, based on what you are reading. Understanding multiple perspectives within an issue helps you form an intelligent opinion and possibly a unique conclusion on your own.

The first four steps of syntopical reading help you answer the questions "What do the authors say about an issue?" and "How do they say it?" Now, at the final stage, you create the latticework upon which you hang the answers you have arrived at by assimilating what you have read and your own experience. This is the step that prepares the way for an original thinker to make a breakthrough.

In Syntopical Reading, you create a latticework of the information in those books, along with your own life experiences and personal knowledge to create mental models and new insights an form an understanding of the world that never quite existed before.
