# The Wisdom of Crowds


In *The Wisdom of Crowds: Why the many are smarter than the few and how collective wisdom shapes business, economies, societies, and nations*, James Surowiecki describes a powerful thesis: under the right circumstances, groups are remarkably intelligent and are often smarter than the smartest people in them.

Surowiecki starts by telling the story of Francis Galton, the English Victorian-era polymath. In a 1907 article published in *Nature*, Galton describes a contest he promoted at the West of England Fat Stock and Poultry Exhibition. In that contest, 787 people paid six pence for the opportunity to guess the weight of a rather large ox at the exhibition. 

A few of the guessers were farmers and butchers, people who might be classified as experts, but a far greater number had no specialized knowledge of farm animals. Based on this information, Galton surmised the mix of participants contained a few very smart guessers, a few who were totally clueless, and the rest - the largest number - being mediocre guessers at best. Based on that formula, he anticipated his 787 participants would most likely end up with a dumb answer. He was wrong.

The ox actually weighed 1198 pounds. Galton took all the guesses and plotted a distribution curve. He found that the median guess was within 0.8 percent of the correct weight and the mean guess was within 0.1 percent. Put differently, the average guess was 1197 pounds. What Galton had discovered was the errors in the left and right tail canceled each other out and what remained was the distilled information.

According to Surowiecki, the two critical variables necessary for a collective to make superior decisions are **diversity** and **independence.** If a collective is able to tabulate decisions from a diverse group of individuals who have different ideas or opinions on how to solve a problem, the results will be superior to a decision made by a group of like-minded thinkers.

Independence, the second critical variable, does not mean each member of the group must remain in isolation but rather each member of the group is basically free from the influence of other members. Independence is important to the collective decision-making process for two reasons, explains Surowiecki. "First, it keeps the mistakes that people make from becoming correlated. Errors in individual judgment won't wreck the group's collective judgment as long as those errors aren't systematically pointing in the same direction. Second, independent individuals are more likely to have new information rather than the same old data everyone is already familiar with."
