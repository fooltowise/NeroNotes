# Heico, Niches get Riches

by [[Scuttleblurb]] 

That TransDigm, a proprietary, sole-sourced parts provider with a business model narrowly designed to maximize shareholder value should, well, produce tons of shareholder value, is perhaps unsurprising.  That HEICO, with an opposing value creation ethos, generates comparable returns on capital selling generic PMA parts, is less intuitive.  A PMA part is an aircraft or engine component deemed by the FAA to be of comparable quality to the one produced by the original manufacturer…and the parts really are of comparable quality – HEICO has shipped more than 70mn of them over the last 20+ years; one has yet to be faulted for a service failure or shutdown.  A non-OEM can either strike a licensing agreement to manufacture the part according to an OEM’s specs or, in HEICO’s case, reverse engineer the product.  Either way, the non-OEM avoids the upfront cost of design and development and so can sell the part at a 25%-45% discount to the original(1). 

The HEICO that we know today was created in late 1989 when accountant-turned-real estate investor Laurans Mendelson, backed by an investor group, took control of the company’s Board, ousted the management team, placed himself at the helm as CEO and installed his two sons, Eric and Victor, in key leadership positions(2).  Shortly thereafter, HEICO divested its legacy medical diagnostic imaging business and concentrated its resources on jet engine replacement parts and aerospace equipment, bolstering its position through several acquisitions.  By 1996, 3/4 of HEICO’s revenue came from selling and serving PMA parts for Pratt & Whitney’s JT8D engine, a dependency that was whittled down as HEICO extended its reach to engines manufactured by GE, CFM(3), and to a much lesser extent Rolls Royce(4). 

Over the last ~decade, engine manufacturers have responded to HEICO’s encroachment with anti-competitive tactics, bundling replacement parts into long-term contracts to obscure price transparency and refusing to support customers using alternative parts.  According to Laurans, GE and/or Pratt have gone so far as to illegally threaten to cancel the warranty on any engine that included a non-OEM part.  This has made it increasingly difficult for HEICO to participate in a market that once comprised the substantial majority of its revenue.  Fortunately, 20 years ago, HEICO’s airline customers began dragging the company into PMA approval for brakes, wheels, electronics, hydraulics, and airframe components that have not been subject to the same retaliatory response(5).  Also, the company has expanded into other areas like distribution, repair and overhaul services (16% of revenue)(6), specialty products like insulation systems (13%), and even OE electrical and power components (40%), such that engine PMA parts account for ~< 15% of HEICO’s revenue today(7). 

Besides retaliation from an entrenched engine oligopoly, perception issues continue to impede adoption and relegate PMA to just 2% of parts consumed by maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) operations.  Most aircraft leasing companies specify OEM-only replacement parts, and many international carriers, wary of the deleterious impact that PMA parts can have on aircraft residual values, include [“no-PMA” clauses](https://www.mro-network.com/maintenance-repair-overhaul/strong-latin-resistance-pma-parts-mostly-due-lessors) on their purchase orders.  The OEMs can then point to the deteriorating effect of PMAs on aircraft values – deterioration based on the misperception that PMA parts are inferior to OE parts – to argue that over the long-term, carriers are better off sole sourcing replacement parts from them (on the other hand, lessors that ban PMA parts on their purchased aircraft will have to accept lower rates from lessees, who are forced to pay up from OE replacement parts).  Despite this obstacle, the core PMA value proposition – equivalent safety and reliability for 50%-70% the cost – is compelling for carriers with growing fleets, especially during downturns, when ~$30mn to $40mn of cost savings matter to an airline anchored by enormous fixed costs.  In the past, HEICO has seized on cyclical turmoil, significantly increasing R&D and purposefully building inventory in the throes of the last two recessions to meet customer demand during the inevitable recovery.  The company’s investments during 2001-2002 were rewarded with 5 straight years of double-digit organic revenue growth from 2004 to 2008.  For a company like HEICO, who thinks beyond one-year increments and doesn’t concern itself with income statement aesthetics, recessionary environments plant the seeds of future value creation. 

Despite the low IP content of its products, HEICO is a better business than one might think.  More so than the FAA approval process, the time it takes for the purchasing and engineering departments of an airline to sign off on the purchase of a new PMA part constrains the number of new products a PMA manufacturer can launch in each year.  Even with the relationships it has nurtured with airlines over the decades, HEICO is limited to ~600 to ~700 annual certifications.  It would take some time for a competitor, even a well-resourced one with HEICO’s impeccable track record, to recreate the 11k parts that HEICO has qualified in its portfolio. 

And once an airline has qualified one of HEICO’s PMA parts and worked it into its rotation, there is no reason for it to revert to the original.  This is true even if the OEM retaliates by price matching because the airline prefers having a secondary supplier in the market as a counterbalance.  But even if that were not the case, an OEM lacks the incentive to undercut HEICO because:

1/ it relies on aftermarket cash flows to generate reasonable returns on its engine or airframe programs;

2/ HEICO purposefully leaves 70% of the market for every part it manufactures to the OEM, so the OEM would be hurting itself more than it would be hurting HEICO (according to management, once HEICO gets to ~30% part share, it sometimes doesn’t even bother trying to win another airline).  HEICO insists that it is not going after the life-limited parts – parts that must be mandatorily replaced after a certain number of cycles – that make up the lifeblood of an engine OEM’s aftermarket revenue streams, but rather selling expendable parts that are replaced (rather than repaired) on an ad hoc basis during shop visits and whose demand patterns are relatively harder to predict.  It is saying to the engine OEs “we’re not a serious threat to you…it’s better for you to relinquish a small portion of your business than piss off your most important customers”; 

and 3/ doing so would provoke HEICO to aggressively go after the entire market, giving rise to a fruitless volley of price cutting that pushes the OEM and HEICO spiraling down to the lower right quadrant of a prisoner’s dilemma.  By looking forward and reasoning backwards, the OEM sees that it is better to cede some share to HEICO and HEICO, in turn, respects the OEM’s dominant position.  Notably, when airlines were seeking relief during the dark days of 2001-2003, OEMs did not cut their prices to hobble HEICO and increase share.  

HEICO has become “by far” the largest PMA supplier through organic product development and acquisitions.  Since the Mendelsons took control in 1990, the company has acquired over 70 companies(8), close to the number of companies that Transdigm has acquired since its founding in 1993.  But HEICO’s approach to acquisitions is very different from TransDigm’s.  Unlike TransDigm, HEICO doesn’t gear up its balance sheet 5x-6x (its net debt/EBITDA is ~1x) or push through price hikes (~all of HEICO’s organic revenue growth over the last decade has come from volume) or slash acquired costs (HEICO mostly leaves the business alone after closing and keeps management in tact).  Whereas TransDigm has gone from paying 6x-8x EBITDA to 9x-12x over the last decade, HEICO insists on paying no more 8x EBITA (with no synergies baked in). 

Some of you may interpret the previous paragraph as a Transdigm diss.  But on the contrary, one could argue that because its organic growth is resilient to cycles (TransDigm’s organic growth dipped by just 2% in 2009), TransDigm can comfortably support a heavy debt burden.  Also, despite paying higher EBITDA multiples than HEICO, Transdigm has generated roughly the same ~20%unlevered incremental cash returns on gross capital as HEICO(9), reflecting its diligence in hiking prices and slashing acquired costs (as a subscriber recently pointed out to me, TransDigm took EBITDA margins on recently acquired Esterline from mid-teens to mid-20s in just the first 6 months of ownership).  One might further argue that given HEICO’s stable free cash flows (carriers can only defer maintenance for so long) and sticky customer relationships (most of the revenue from the Flight Support Group business comes from long-term agreements), the company is needlessly forgoing equity value creation by _not_ assuming more acquisition debt. 

But by focusing too narrowly on their philosophical differences – and there are differences; TransDigm’s clinical “shareholder-first” practice of hiking prices, cutting costs, and applying financial leverage wouldn’t survive in HEICO’s customer and employee-centric culture – we risk marginalizing the organizational setup that TransDigm and HEICO have in common.  Both companies are decomposed into small, autonomous business units with their own P&Ls, giving rise to a culture of accountability that is often lost in top-down bureaucratic structures like the kind that Rolls Royce has wrestled with for years.  I’ve previously defined culture as a set of unspoken expectations that guides day-to-day behavior.  Behavior begot through culture can’t be propagated by top-down mandate because there’s no way the central body of a large enterprise can delineate and enforce policies that adequately anticipate the blind spots or exploit the opportunities that emerge in a complex adaptive system.  An organization that hopes to instill cost discipline by pushing initiatives down from the top will not be nearly as effective as one that has cost discipline baked into muscle memory at all levels.

HEICO employees care, at least in part, because they own the company.  In many of its acquisitions, HEICO will take an ~80% stake, leaving the remaining ~20% to previous owners, who are rewarded for meeting their growth targets.  The Mendelsons own 8% of the company’s shares and most of HEICO’s 4,000+ US employees participate in the company’s 401(k) – at the end of 2017, [~54% of the 401(k)’s $417mn in assets](http://www.401k-lookup.com/Company401k/401k_plan_view.php/CompanyID/650341002/PlanID/001) was held in HEICO stock – which partly matches annual contributions with HEICO stock, a scheme that when paired with the stock’s appreciation has made millionaires out of some of the company’s rank-and-file. 

 _“about 6 months ago when I send out the quarterly reports, I received an e-mail back from one of our secretaries. And the comment, I paraphrase, ‘Dear Larry, thank you so much for sending the report. We are doing so well.’… And she further went on to say, ‘And it’s wonderful to know that someday when I retire, I will retire as a millionaire.’ This is a secretary. So when you put that in perspective and understand that the people who are building this company, and supporting it, and doing the great things that we can do, they look at it as their company, they are working for themselves”._

-   Laurans Mendelson (3q18 earnings call)

HEICO is the feel-good Transdigm, a great soapbox on which to pontificate about culture and customer centricity.  You love HEICO, I love HEICO.  But unlike love, stocks come with a price.  In August 2017, management noted that the valuation of its stock, at 40x earnings, was “quite high” but caveated that investors valued HEICO on free cash flow, on which basis its multiple was more reasonable at 25x.  Well, today HEICO’s A shares(10) trades at 35x free cash flow, partly reflecting the optimism in Laurans Mendelson’s observation from this past May that “in the 29 years that we have been running HEICO, I have never seen a business climate as positive and strong as this one”.  As HEICO’s organic growth has inflected into double-digits and the stock has gone vertical, adulation has intensified, which makes me suspect that perhaps investors are perhaps reverse engineering a narrative they would not have considered when the company’s growth was more modest notwithstanding every other thing we care about today – the moat, the management, the culture – being exactly the same.  But does it necessarily follow that the stock is egregiously priced?

Here is a time series of organic growth stretching back to 2004: 

![](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pic1.png)

(fiscal year ends October)

Growth is sort of all over the place but blends out to around ~8%/year for FSG and ~6% for ETG.  There was a 5-year stretch of double-digit FSG organic growth from 2004 to 2008 in the wake of a brutal contraction in airline capacity.  Since the last period of negative organic growth (fy09), HEICO has experienced 10 years of mid-single digit growth. 

I’ve heard some investors claim that the ETG segment, which is ~2/3 defense and space and generates much higher EBITDA margins than the FSG segment (35% vs. 22%), may have hit an enduring turning point in organic growth.  Maybe, but it’s hard to gain confidence from 1 year of data.  After all, this segment also grew by 10% and 12% in fy10 and fy11, respectively, after many years of middling growth, before reverting to low/mid-single digit growth for the next 7 years.  One might interpret today’s double-digit growth as evidence that the DoD is finally getting serious about allocating budget towards PMA parts, but Transdigm’s defense business has grown by mid/high-teens recently, roughly the same rate as HEICO’s total defense and space revenue (across both segments, including acquisitions), suggesting a more general uplift in defense parts spending than a share shift towards PMA.  The government has bemoaned excessive parts pricing since at least 2002.  Not much has come of these complaints.  But I get the sense that the screw is turning ever so slightly.  In response to a recent Inspector General report from February 2019 that sternly recommended _“that the DLA and the Army consider all available corrective actions with TransDigm, including but not limited to, directing contracting officers to seek a voluntary refund from TransDigm for excess profits identified in this report”_, TransDigm refunded $16mn with no admission of wrongdoing.  This is a trivial sum, to be sure, but it is the first time I can recall the company paying any such refund(11). 

Might there also be movement on the commercial side?  Engine manufacturers’ aggressive tactics have provoked investigations by certain government bodies.  Pressured by an anti-competitive complaint that the IATA filed with the European Commission in 2016, CFM – a 50/50 JV between GE and Safran that has over 70% share of the narrowbody engine installed base – last year agreed to certain “conduct policies” that [make it easier for third party vendors to provide replacement parts and MRO services](https://www.mro-network.com/engines-engine-systems/cfm-ge-adopt-mro-conduct-policies-iata-signs-cfm-agreement) for CFM’s latest engine models. 

Let’s assume that over the next 7 years, HEICO delivers 8% organic revenue growth in FSG and 6% in ETG, in line with historical experience.  Will organic growth be 15% or 5% in two years?  No clue.  But planes will always require regular maintenance and I expect PMA parts will continue to chip away at OEM share, even absent dramatic regulatory action.  Let’s say EBITDA margins expand from 26% to 29%, below the 5-6pt margin expansion we’ve seen from fy11 to fy18, and free cash flow is recycled into acquisitions at 8x EBITDA (or ~12x FCFE).  Under this scenario, I can derive $1bn of free cash flow in year 7.  Slap on a 30x and the stock compounds at 12%/year.  At 20x, the IRR is more like 6%.  The stock isn’t a screaming buy, but nor does it seem as wildly overvalued as I had originally intuited.  If the stock were 20%-30% lower, I’d probably buy some. 

Anyways, regardless of the how vigorously you’ve tweaked the Excel, your confidence in these inputs ultimately boils down to a judgment call on the sustainability of certain qualitative factors.  We can bicker all day about high-level numerical assumptions, but a position in HEICO requires a belief in the durability of the company’s ownership culture, because that culture gives rise to the trust it has engendered with airline customers and acquired companies over the last 30 years; and that trust is responsible for the expanding breadth of HEICO’s product portfolio and the volumes required to cost efficiently serve customers and develop product.

PMA parts started to gain legitimacy due in no small part to a series of partnerships and strategic alliances that HEICO struck with major airline operators in the late ‘90s/early ‘00s, including one that left Lufthansa with a 20% minority investment in the company’s PMA and repair subsidiary.
