Subsciption services are a form of [[Recurring Revenues]] that leap to mind when thinking about this economic feature of business, but it is probably the least rewarding form. The installed base is not upfront product purchases, but existing subscriptions where the recurring revenue resides in prospects for subscription renewals.

That difference requires attention to the lock-in mechanism's strength. Some services offered on subscription-like terns are undifferentiated, such as cell phone plans. When the cost of switching is low, customers soon migrate to cheaper options. In this business model, the dominant competitive dynamic is to become the low cost producer rather than to exploit the value of recurring revenue.

Subscriptions that are either differentiated or embedded into an automated system can be attractive. A differentiated subscription is when a company's product lacks close rivals: a good example would be periodicals with genuinely differentiated content, such as *The Economist*. An embedded subscription exists when a provider transmits information which is incorporated into larger systems or processes, such as pricing data transmitted to market analysts or credit histories sent to bank credit scoring personnel.
