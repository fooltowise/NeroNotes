Velocity challenges us to think about what we can do to put ourselves on the right vector, to find a balance between mass and speed to move in the direction of our goals. Gains come from both improving our tactics and being able to adjust to and respond to new information.

No one wants to rush around, filling up their days with task and duties, then look up in twenty years and be in exactly the same place. We want to move somewhere so we can look back and identify the territory we've covered. This is why having a direction is important. It lets us evaluate the usefulness of what we are doing by giving us a measurement of where we want to go.
Velocity also reminds us how important it is to be able to adjust our tactics to continue toward our direction. Sometimes this might mean being smaller, so we don't have to apply resources to multiple and often competing directions. Itis easier to redirect a canoe than a battleship. Being able to move in the right direction is a lot more useful than going fast in the wrong one.
