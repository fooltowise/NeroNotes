# Float
Getting paid by customers before needing to pay suppliers or fulfill a service is a great trait, especially when a company can use its payable to accelerate high-returning reinvestment.

If a cash flow rich company has a big non-financial liability and maybe negative equity and/or negative working capital, there is a strong likelihood it is due to float.


Float isn’t talked about nearly enough regarding internet companies.


### Forms of funding
Companies fund their operations using equity and debt. Both have their drawbacks...

Equity is very expensive.
Debt comes with a host of covenants.

Leverage, though, can be very powerful. Many people are familiar with how leverage can MAGNIFY returns.

For example, if you put 20% down on a USD 1m house, your initial investment is $200k. If you sell the house for double (USD2m), you pay the bank USD800k and you keep 1.2m. Viola, you just created a 6x return (1.2m/200k) on a 2x price appreciation.

That, my friend, is leverage at work.

### Leverage from float
Warren Buffet famously generated a 20% annual return over 6 decades... an amazing record for sure, but a lot of it was plain ol’ leverage.

You see, insurance companies take money in TODAY and pay money out TOMORROW. Just like debt! Buffett calls this money “float”.


Berkshire has managed his insurance operations such that he pays ZERO interest on this “debt”.

“So far, those funds, though they are recorded as a huge net liability on our balance sheet, have been of more utility for us than an equivalent amount of equity.”

Buffett also created a system in which insurance OUTFLOWS are generally less than INFLOWS. This ensures $BRK float rarely declines.

Buffett used float to essentially create a 0% interest rate, indefinite, revolving credit line…

But the power of insurance float has been widely analyzed. We all KNOW this. And float isn’t THAT amazing since it comes with its own host of restrictions...

Insurance companies must adhere to capital requirements AND must invest a portion in low-yielding govt. securities.

### Other forms of Float

But there are other kinds of “float-like” liabilities that allow companies to produce superior returns w/o resorting to debt or equity financing.

These are much less talked about but are equally as powerful! And we see this in a variety of industries…

**Airplane manufacturing...**

Companies like BA require payment today for airlines that will be delivered many years into the future. This backlog can span 10+ years! These payments fund working cap, allowing them to grow their biz while investing MINIMAL Dollars.

They call this “progress billings”


**Human Resources...**

ADP takes in cash from companies that will eventually be used to fund payroll for ADP-covered employees. ADP is free to invest these funds until they’re eventually paid out... And while these returns are small, they are EXTREMELY levered, so ROE is HIGH.

ADP calls these funds “client funds obligations”.

**Subscription Models...**

This is probably the second most well-known form of float outside insurance, but companies pay subscription firms like Salesforce for providing software. $CRM can then use this cash to generate new biz.

They call this “deferred revenue”.

**Investing...**

A buy-and-hold strategy generates an intangible form of leverage: deferred tax assets. This is the potential tax bill you will pay if you sell your investments.

But until they are sold, these “tax-stamped” funds are actually working for you…

**Deferred Income Taxes**
The final funding source - which again $BRK processes to an unusual degree - is deferred income taxes. These are liabilities that we will eventually pay but that are meanwhile interest free.”

We also see the power of DTAs in other places like the Sequoia Fund.


**Cemetery Operations...**

In the cemetery biz, there are actually three types of float, but I will only cover one.

Companies like $SCI will sell a burial plot ~15 years before the purchaser actually passes away. During this period, SCI can invest these funds!

SCI calls these funds “deferred receipts”. And by the way, “care trust corpus” is another form of float!

**Loyalty Programs...**

Aside from making lines shorter, the SBUX app has allowed it to create a $1.3bn “fund” that it uses to invest in working capital. Airlines are also famous for using their loyalty mile programs as float.


And many, many more...

Moral of the story: Buffett made float sexy, but many great businesses are using the same model to create leveraged returns WITHOUT ever touching debt.

Everyone calls it something different but the function all the same!


So the next time you’re reading through a financial statement, take a good look at the liabilities section.

**Is there a sizable non-debt line item funding a good portion of assets?**

**Does the company have negative equity?**

**Chances are this company is using a form of float...**


The rewards can be enormous. The long-run returns of many of the companies I mentioned here have consistently outperformed the market.

And why wouldn’t they?

You can create outsized returns without any of the traditional baggage traditional debt or equity finance bring.
