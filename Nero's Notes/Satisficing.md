[[People hate uncertainty]].

Often it is better to avoid an [[Inversion|horrible mistake]] than have the absolute best result.

As a result, people tend to look for the solution with the lowest variance in outcome, not the one providing the absolute best outcome.

Ex:
- Hiring employees: companies like to hire graduates (see [[Education as signalling of commitment]])
- Nobody gets fired if you choose the industry standard
