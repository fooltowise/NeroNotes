# Authority in [[Copywriting]]

## How to create a massive authority in a Home Page

The goal of a home page is to create trust, build authority and to offer next steps. It's your public image, which is why your homepage is like your PR page - it's public relations at its finest.


Your home page is often the first thing your prospects see when they come to your website, so you gotta make that first impression count. 

According to a CrazyEgg study, you only have one minute to get your prospects to stick around. So you need to professionally and clearly communicate the what, the who, the where, the when, the why and the how of your business or that of your clients as soon as possible. 

### What your Home Page is not. 

Your Home page is not your About page. Your About page is where you expand on your background, your company history, your values, your mission and/or your team. It's where all that stuff goes that's important, but not need-to-know-right-away for your ideal prospect. 

So think of your Home page as your "elevator pitch" about who you are and what you do, and your About page is where people can go for the full story. 

Now a Landing page, on the other hand, is designed to receive direct traffic from a very specific source, like an ad or an email, hence the word "landing".

Landing pages are conversion tools and focus on a singular call-to-action. They are built for paid traffic campaigns, promotional pages and lead generation and aren't necessarily designed to be permanent pages in your site's main navigation - unlike your Homepage, which acts as a permanent root to your .com.


### 1. What can you do for me?

While your website visitors wanna know who you are, what they really care about is what you can do for them. The header section that appears on your homepage, above the fold, is the most important part of your homepage. This is what determines whether someone stays and scrolls, or bounces on out of there...

The best header copy clearly states your business or brand name, and your unique selling proposition. Do not, and I repeat, do not write "Welcome to our website!"

If you're planning to use your home page to capture leads, this is also a great section to plug in a call to action button. 

A great header example is Shopify Partners, which uses their headline and sub-headline to convey a powerful benefit and quickly summarizes what they can do for you. (Headline: *Manage the complexity of your business in one place* - Sub-Headline: *Shopify Plus is the enterprise commerce platform that's powerful, intuitive, and scalable.*)

And don't forget to include other elements in your header that are focal to your brand, such as your logo and a clear and easy-to-navigate menu. 

### 2. Why should I listen to you?

So in other words - what makes you different? How did you get here, what's your mission, why are you the one that can help me?

Somewhere on your homepage, include a short description about you and your story to create trust and reliability. Now, more than ever, people are looking for businesses they can relate to. This is especially important if you're writing copy for a personality-based brand. 

You can do this with a short bio, like what Marie Forleo did on her homepage. Or you could do a quick dive into your origin story to be real about your journey, like Connor Beaton, empowerment coach and founder of ManTalks, did on his home page. 

If you are not writing a home page for a personality-based brand, your can use this section of your copy to carry the company's mission and values, like the example of MindValley where they clearly state their mission of changing the world's education system.

### 3. What makes you legit?

It's important that your homepage builds trust and credibility. So showcase as much social proof as you can. These authority elements can include client testimonials, media appearances, press coverage, or featuring any notable brand you've worked with. 

If you or your client don't have these credibility boosters just yet, you can link to your social media account to showcase following size, or at the very least demonstrate that you're active across all social media platforms which gives your business more visibility and therefore credibility. And no matter what, please always make sure it's fact-checked and authentic!

### 4. What do you do?

Many brands and businesses make the mistake of leaving this critical information elsewhere on their site, like an About page or a dedicated work with me page. While it's still a good idea to still have these two pages, don't take the risk of having someone bounce off before they have even the slightest idea about what your service is or what you do. 
Even if you've mentioned it briefly on other parts of your homepage, make sure to have a section that clearly summarizes your work or your unique offer and convey the benefits that this will provide. 

Tribe47, a digital marketing agency, does a really clever job of this on their website with a "Why" section that both establishes how they work and the benefits a client will experience by working with them, followed by a little section with their services. 


### 5. Where do I start?

Don't make people guess next steps! Let them know how they can get in touch with you, experience your product, or potentially work with you! If you do have a lead capture on your homepage, make sure that it is visible at multiple points throughout your copy, so don't just rely on a single call to action at the header or the footer. You can feature it midway on your homepage, or use a floating signup bar in a way that doesn't disturb your visitors. 

A great tool that I've seen before is Hellobar. It allows you to add a subtle and slick call to action banner on your site.

If you aren't capturing leads, or featuring a sale, launch or program, you can simply suggest your visitors contact you, say for a quote, a call or a strategy session via a contact form. 


### 6. Why should I stick around?

Ultimately, the goal of your homepage is to turn those lurkers into leads. You want to keep your ideal customers on your website or in your brand's ecosystem. So your homepage needs to make it really easy for your audience to visit other parts of your site. 

This could be done by linking your homepage to other featured pages on your website, like your About page, work with me page, and blog. 

Sharing your social media and content platforms is also a great way to get your visitors to explore your brand. So make sure you have visible icons or plug-ins on your homepage to make it easy for all of them to connect and engage with you say on Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram and YouTube, if you're active on those sites. 


## The most important part

Keep it short and sweet! Home pages are meant to be punchy. You want to use powerful and precise wording to get your message across in the shortest way possible.
