## Checklist for a landing Page/Sales Page and a compelling offer
1. **The Headline**: the sole purpose of the headline is to grab the viewer's attention so he can engage with you. To pique your prospect's curiosity enough to continue reading or listening
2. **The S-Hook**: a hook is any idea that hooks the viewer's interest. You should open a hook with your headline and then continue this hook as you begin your sales message. It should provoke an emotion and help the reader identify with you. This is when your prospect self-selects. It is the 20% of the copy that takes 80% of the time to write, and it makes 80% of the impact on the reader.
> People will do anything for those who encourage their dreams, justify their failures, allay their fears, confirm their suspicions and help them throw rocks at their enemies.

This component of your sales message needs to do at least one of those things. 
The S hook does this in three ways: Stories, Science or Suppositions.
3. **The Problem:** You must address the pain or problem the viewer is feeling. You want them to know that you understand what they are going through, that they're not alone and you are here to help. You can do it in a way that shows empathy and understanding rather than fear and force.
4. **The offer:** this is where you present your solution to said problem in number 3. You must make sure that the price you are asking is below the value that your prospect is perceiving. You want a high gap! Two ways to create this gap is a) discounts or b) premium.
5. **Benefits:** Why someone should buy your offer. This is the perfect time to address all the potential objections your prospect might have. You also need to provide at least some sort of immediate benefit. 
6. **Social proof:** Social proof allays your prospects fears, creates massive trust and builds authority. In any way you can you want to show how many people have already benefited from your product or service.
7. **[[Scarcity]]:** You want to make your product or service seem limited in some way, and therefore harder to obtain. [[Scarcity]] gives your prospect a reason to buy RIGHT NOW.
8. **Risk Reversal:** Hopefully by now you have created so much trust that all you really need to do here is share all the stuff that makes good business sense. Your guarantee, your payment terms, and your purchase expectations. People like to be told exactly what is going to happen next, like how safe and secure their order is, and how and when they can expect to receive their purchase. 
9. **A call to action:** You need to tell your prospect what you want them to do. The most important rule is to only have one clear and concise call to action. You should ask your prospect to do only one thing, and that's either signup, or buy.
