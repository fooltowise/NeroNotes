### [[Constellation Software]]’s Topicus Spin-Out Details - September 2020

The [prospectus for the spin out TSS+Topicus](https://www.csisoftware.com/docs/default-source/investor-relations/statutory-filings/preliminary_prospectus---filing-copy---september-21-2020.pdf) is out. I won’t go over the whole thing here, but there are a few highlights.

They will dividend out 1.859817814 share of the new entity for every common share of CSI.

The way they’ve structured things to minimize taxes is a bit confusing, with preferred shares that at first will retain most of the value but can later be converted back to subordinated shares when certain conditions are met (see pages 40-42).

For a bit I thought they had created a clever structure where CSI and the Topicus shareholders would retain most of the current value and only future growth in free cashflow above the preferred’s dividend amount would accrue to the new shares (which would be a kind of tracking stock, but not for just an asset, but for future value creation), but now I’m back to thinking that this is a more conventional spin out and that I was confused by the tax minimization structure.

I hope that when a date for the spin is announced, management comes out with a “for dummy” explanation of the structure, either in one of their shareholder Q&As on the website or a letter from Mark or Jamal.

The new Topicus entity will be listed on the TSX Venture. They aren’t raising any new capital, they are just creating shares for the new combined entity and listing those.

Constellation will retain voting control, through a _single_ super-voting share that gives them 50.1% of the vote, and that gives them a right of approval for acquisitions “exceeding US$100 million”. (I love how the just made 1 super voting share — usually companies create a bunch or a round number, but here they went for the Trillion Dollar Coin edition of this concept.)

It’ll have 4,250 employees in Europe, split among 85 software business units, hosted in three operating groups: TSS Public, TSS Blue, and Topicus.

> The geographic markets that the Company operates in are the Netherlands, France, Romania, Denmark, Spain, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Belgium, Italy and the United Kingdom [...]
> 
> primary vertical markets in which these operating groups operate include Accountancy, Agriculture, Associations, Automotive, Central Government, Education, Facility Management, Finance, Healthcare, Hospitality, Legal, Local Government, Manufacturing, Mobility, Real Estate and Retail

I’m a little surprised at how deep in the red licenses and hardware are, but I’m not worried, since they’re a _tiny_ fraction of revenues, and that dollar-for-dollar (or euro-for-euro), the value is coming from maintenance & recurring. Professional services are a big chunk of revenues too, and they’re often used to help acquire new customers and bring in new maintenance revenue. It can sometimes also help R&D efforts and minimize risk, if you’re working closely with customers and can basically “build to order” products that are almost pre-sold.

Otherwise, the organic growth for maintenance looks solid, and is higher than Constellation’s average as a whole (more around 3-4% in recent times). Based on some things that Mark has said, I think that organic growth at the newly acquired Topicus is significantly higher than at TSS, so hopefully by working together they can improve organic growth more widely at the combined entity.

What will be interesting is to watch how successful this experiment is, and if it is, whether we’ll then see similar spins of the other operating groups (Volaris, Harris, Vela, Jonas, Perseus) over time.

### Constellation’s Topicus Share Timeline

I wrote about the Topicus spin-out (which is basically TSS + Topicus) [in edition #29](https://libertyrpf.substack.com/p/29-constellation-softwares-topicus). At the time, we didn’t have a timeline, but the company [release some details yesterday](https://www.csisoftware.com/docs/default-source/press-releases/press_release_re__conditional_dividend.pdf):

> If the Condition Precedent is satisfied, the record date for Constellation shareholders entitled to receive the **Conditional Dividend is October 28, 2020** (the “Record Date”), and **the payment date will be determined and announced once the Condition Precedent is satisfied**.

### [[Constellation Software]]’s Volaris Creates Modaxo (Future Spin-Out?) - October 2020

Volaris’ transportation businesses (which formed around the original Trapeze acquisition, where CSI COO and Volaris CEO Mark Miller was the founder, iirc) are changing their identity to Modaxo.

I have a hard time understanding why they would do this if they aren’t thinking of a spin down the road, since all these businesses were already inside the same operating group (Volaris) and could already share information, and CSI generally prefers to split things apart and make them smaller, not aggregate them together and make them bigger.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

One benefit of creating this umbrella unit would be to improve what Mark Leonard has described as “a sense of identity” for employees that is bigger than at the business unit level, but isn’t as unfocused as at the group or holding company level. So maybe this has nothing to do with a spin (or at least, not an imminent one).

[Here’s the release](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/20/2111016/0/en/Introducing-Modaxo-A-Global-Collective-of-Technology-Businesses-Singularly-Focused-on-People-Transportation.html):

> Today marks the official launch of Modaxo, a new, dedicated global organization **bringing together businesses from across Volaris Group that collectively focus on advancing new technologies and innovations for People Transportation**. Bill Delaney has been named Modaxo’s CEO.

Delaney was already CEO of the “Global Transit Portfolio” inside Volaris, and before that he was a portfolio manager there. He’s based in Australia and was in charge of M&A in the Asia Pacific region at Volaris and a managing director at Trapeze (the transportation group).

> With more than **two dozen companies, representing 12 brands, Modaxo comprises 2,000 people, operating from 35 offices in 21 countries around the world**. Today’s launch of Modaxo, brings these businesses together under a global banner, with a singular focus and passion to provide the software and technologies that move the world’s people.
> 
> **The businesses that make up Modaxo retain their existing brands and continue to service customers in their local markets, but become part of a larger organization with Modaxo, sharing industry knowledge and market understandings to help drive new product innovation and services**.
> 
> Businesses under the Modaxo banner include Binary System, Cittati, Empresa1, Holmedal, Imperial, PLANit, Signature Rail, Systemtechnik, TransTrack Systems, Trapeze Group, and TripSpark.

[Here’s the new company website](https://modaxo.com/about-us/).

Mark Leonard had [said at the 2020 AGM](https://twitter.com/pearnick/status/1318575197314834432?s=20) that they were interested in “trying a spin-out or two.”, so maybe this is number two.

### [[Constellation Software]]: Volaris Creates Lumine Group for its Communications & Media Businesses - October 2020

First Volaris created Modaxo (see [edition #41](https://libertyrpf.substack.com/p/41-constellation-softwares-modaxo)) for their transportation assets, and now they’re creating a new identity for the comms & media stuff…

Is this just some Spring cleaning to refocus some sub-groups and give them more identity and culture and clear leadership, or is this setting things up for more spins and/or reorganization (could some of these become full groups, directly below the holding co level?).

> “Lumine’s vision is to create a global ecosystem to help accelerate the growth and internationalization of communications and media software businesses,” says David Nyland, President of Lumine Group. “Businesses can leverage global resources including product innovation, customers and channels, support to enter new geographies, and a wealth of domain-specific best practices to scale efficiently.”
> 
> **Since 2013, Lumine has built a global portfolio of complementary communications and media software businesses, completing 16 acquisitions with employees in over 30 countries**. The portfolio encompasses a global network of customers, including tier-1 operators across the world.
> 
> “Lumine brings together a combination of innovative technology, great talent, and industry expertise under a single banner,” says Mark Miller, CEO of Volaris Group, and COO of [[Constellation Software]]. “The Lumine team will continue our legacy in this space, deploying Volaris best-practices and our winning buy-and-hold-forever formula.” ([Source](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/27/2115052/0/en/Volaris-Group-Introduces-Lumine-Group-to-Focus-on-Communications-Media-Business.html))

The [Lumine site](https://www.luminegroup.com/our-companies) has a nice timeline showing all the acquisitions they’ve made over time (near the bottom of the page).



### [[Constellation Software]] Q3 - November 2020

[![Image](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1c58451-18b0-42bc-9d55-de5420c4cff5_1370x736.jpeg "Image")](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd1c58451-18b0-42bc-9d55-de5420c4cff5_1370x736.jpeg)


This shows CSI’s organic growth over the past few years. The table at the bottom is adjusted to take out foreign exchange, so it’s more representative of business performance.

It’s clear that the pandemic has had a big impact on various aspects of the business, but remember that most of the value is created by the “maintenance and recurring” line, and that during the worst of the crisis, this was -1% ex-FX, and now is back to +1% ex-FX.

Licenses, which are very high margin, but more lumpy, also had significant sequential improvement (from -28% to -11%), as did pro services and hardware (always lumpy, and much lower margin).

To me it’s hard to think of a bigger test of the business, and from a defensive angle, things held up very well.

On the offensive side, it looks like capital deployment is doing well:

> A number of **acquisitions were completed for aggregate cash consideration of $123 million** (which includes acquired cash). Deferred payments associated with these acquisitions have an estimated value of $25 million resulting in **total consideration of $148 million**. [...]
> 
> **Subsequent to September 30**, 2020, the Company completed or entered into agreements to acquire a number of businesses for aggregate cash consideration of **$47 million** (which includes acquired cash). Deferred payments associated with these acquisitions have an estimated value of $19 million resulting in **total consideration of $66 million**.

I’ve seen an analyst theorize that maybe they were getting better multiples on the businesses that they were buying, but that’s hard to know for sure (they could be paying lower multiple, but for worse businesses, for example). I would guess that the very small companies that CSI buys aren’t quite as impacted by low interest rates and public market multiple expansion as larger software companies, but they may be more impacted by the damage in the real economy, so it’s possible that some may be selling for lower multiples. That’s just my guess, though.

Overall revenue grew 15% in Q3 (-1% organic ex-FX, which sure beats -7% organic ex-FX in Q2). Cash from ops +32%, free cash flow +35%, and EBITDA margin abnormally high around 33%, but that includes some govt help and grants and reduced operational expenses (travel, etc).

The TSS “membership liability” going up as fast as it has lately — +85% YTD — is probably a good sign about how well that group has been doing (which bodes well for the spin).

They still expect the Topicus acquisition to close “in 2020”, which will then pave the way for the completion of the spin of the new TSS+Topicus entity. I’m sure they’re looking forward to having some of that Topicus know-how and culture spread to TSS and the rest of CSI, as Topicus has been very successful at organic growth and launching new products, which hasn’t been CSI’s strongest point (well, to be fair, if they weren’t _world class_ at M&A, they’d surely invest a lot more in organic growth and would be doing better).

[I wrote about Topicus a bit in edition #29](https://libertyrpf.substack.com/p/29-constellation-softwares-topicus).

### [[Constellation Software]]’s Topicus Acquisition & TSS Spin Back on Calendar - December 2020

After a hiatus for unknown reasons, we’re back to our regular programs:

> [[Constellation Software]], acting through its TSS operating group and its subsidiary TPCS Holding B.V., **entered into a binding agreement with IJssel B.V. to purchase 100% of the shares of Topicus.com** B.V., a Netherlands-based diversified vertical market software provider. In connection with the anticipated closing of the acquisition and the subsequent public listing of the subordinate voting shares of Topicus.com Inc., **TSS will be spun out of Constellation and will operate together with Topicus as a separate publicly traded company**.
> 
> Constellation also announced today that it has resolved to **pay a special dividend pursuant to which all common shareholders of record on December 28, 2020** will be entitled to receive, by way of a dividend-in-kind, **1.859817814 subordinate voting shares of Topicus.com Inc. for each common share of Constellation** held. The payment date for the Dividend is expected to be on or **about January 4, 2021**. [...]
> 
> The Spin-Out Shares have been conditionally approved for **listing on the TSX Venture Exchange**, subject to Topicus.com Inc. fulfilling all of the listing requirements. **Trading of the Spin-Out Shares** [...] is expected to begin approximately **30 days following completion of the acquisition** of Topicus. ([Source](https://www.csisoftware.com/category/press-releases/2020/12/18/constellation-software-inc.-files-final-prospectus-and-declares-dividend-in-connection-with-proposed-topicus.com-spin-out))

I wrote about the [Topicus acquisition & TSS spin in edition #29](https://libertyrpf.substack.com/p/29-constellation-softwares-topicus). I don’t have much to add since, well, we haven’t really learned much about it since…

### Constellation’s Topicus Spin to Trade Feb. 1st - January 2021

The purchase of the old Topicus by Constellation is now official, and the new Topicus (which includes CSI’s TSS group) has a [new website](https://topicus.com/):

> The Spin-Out Shares have been conditionally approved for listing on the TSX Venture Exchange, subject to Topicus.com’s fulfillment of final listing requirements. Trading of the Spin-Out Shares on the TSX Venture Exchange is expected to begin on or about February 1, 2021.

The [prospectus is here](https://topicus-platform.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/__/topicuscom/statutory-filings/final-propsectus-eng-filed.pdf). I always like this table showing organic growth for the various segments:

### [[Constellation Software]] Q4 - February 2021

Just a few highlights (you can see the [whole report](https://bit.ly/3u1iSlB) and [press release](https://bit.ly/3pmHykI) for more):

> **Q4:**
> 
> Revenue grew 14% (1% organic growth, negative 1% after adjusting for changes in FX)
> 
> A number of **acquisitions** were completed for aggregate cash consideration of **$179 million** (which includes acquired cash). Deferred payments associated with these acquisitions have an estimated value of $60 million resulting in **total consideration of $239 million**.
> 
> **Free cash flow available to shareholders** (“FCFA2S”) increased $113 million to $307 million compared to $193 million for the same period in 2019 representing an **increase of 59%**.
> 
> On January 5, 2021, the Company completed its purchase of 100% of the shares of Topicus.com B.V.

Dat 28.1% FCF margin. Though expenses were depressed because of the pandemic and some gov’t grants helped. But still, it’s better than the alternative of seeing margins fall during tough times…

> **FY2020:**
> 
> Revenue grew 14% (negative 3% organic growth, negative 3% after adjusting for changes in FX)
> 
> A number of **acquisitions** were completed for aggregate cash consideration of **$477 million** (which includes acquired cash). Deferred payments associated with these acquisitions have an estimated value of $151 million resulting in **total consideration of $628 million**.
> 
> **Free cash flow available to shareholders** (“FCFA2S”) increased $399 million to $989 million compared to $590 million for the same period in 2019 representing an **increase of 68%**.

Reminder that Topicus wasn't a full-spin:

> Constellation’s equity interest in TSS prior to the Spin-Out Transactions was 66.7%. **Constellation’s equity interest in Topicus.com after completion of the Spin-Out Transactions on a fully diluted basis is approximately 30.4%**. In addition, Constellation as the holder of a super voting share is entitled to that number of **votes that equals 50.1%** of the aggregate number of votes

That FX-adjusted table I always like to look at (especially that line, where most of the value is):

[![Image](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa140ae05-7e9e-4061-9efb-4fbd431e5c0b_1462x398.jpeg "Image")](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa140ae05-7e9e-4061-9efb-4fbd431e5c0b_1462x398.jpeg)

The above is particularly interesting because **not all revenue is created equal**. So if you just look at the aggregated organic revenue growth number, you can easily mis what is going on under the surface.

For example, if organic growth is flat, but hardware is tanking and licenses & maintenance/recurring are doing great, I don’t really care. But if it’s the reverse, I may start to become worried…

Cash is piling up. Even excluding TSS, they have $690m with $160m of bank debt.

It’ll be interesting what they will decide to do with it if it keeps increasing and larger deals don’t materialize for a bit.

I wouldn’t be surprised to see another special dividend (Mark sounded like he was warming up a little to the idea of buybacks in recent AGMs, but I’d guess he probably likes special divs better because he’s very sensitive to the idea that management with inside information is buying back shares from shareholders who are less sophisticated and informed).

They broke out organic growth by segment and ex-TSS, which shows how good TSS has been doing lately (and that’s without Topicus, which historically has had even higher organic growth):

### TSS M&A Pre-and-Post Acquisition by [[Constellation Software]]  - February 2021


$CSU.to acquired TSS - now $TOI.to - from the Strikwerda family office in 2013. TSS was already set up to be a serial acquirer of VMS businesses, but that CSU Midas touch really kicked things into sixth gear. From 1-2 deals/year to almost 20 by 2020. Speaks volumes about process

### [[Constellation Software]] 2017 Annual Meeting - February 2021

Friend-of-the-show [MBB](https://twitter.com/LockStockBarrl/status/1386992937989443593) was reminiscing about the 2017 Constellation AGM (where she and I first met — note that she has the lowest cost basis on CSU of anyone I know that doesn’t have “Leonard” as a last name).

I mentioned, “That was a fun AGM. I was sitting in the center of the front row” and [C.J. Oppel](https://twitter.com/CJOppel/status/1387084708698202114) said “Liberty, photo of you and Mark or it didn't happen!”

Well well well. It just so happens that I have one. What a great moment that was:

### ‘[[Constellation Software]] & Org Design’ - July 2021 

Friend-of-the-show and supporter (💚 🥃) [Shomik Ghosh has a great post](https://shomik.substack.com/p/constellation-software-and-org-design) that looks at [[Constellation Software]]’s organization structure, and how that gives it various competitive advantages:

> I believe CSU’s competitive moat is driven by org design.
> 
> As you can see from the chart above, CSU is a complex business. However, the structure of the org is very intentional. CSU has honed the craft of what decisions need to be centralized and what can be decentralized. They have structured the org to maintain flexibility and agility in their core competency, acquiring companies. This allows them to continue doing acquisitions that I believe number over 100 companies a year! [...]
> 
> The interesting thing about the Operating Groups (OG) is that they all operate independently and have their own CEOs. CSU will share best practices, hurdle rates, and can help on planning, but each OG can have their own culture. Some decide to centralize decision making more, some decide to stick with their competencies more and not expand into other verticals, etc. [...]
> 
> CSU can acquire 100 companies that may total the same value as 1 PE acquisition and do that across industries, geographies, and scale at an increasingly accelerated pace as CSU’s crm of target companies grows. Now ask Vista if they will purchase a golf club software business for $10M. See what they say. This is CSU’s competitive advantage and why Leonard spends so much time studying other businesses, focusing on incentives, and tweaking the org design.

Another aspect that makes CSI’s (not a typo: CSU is the ticker, CSI is the acronym for the name) structure an advantage is how it makes the small low-growth VMSes more valuable by giving them reinvestment opportunities.

ie. A standalone VMS may have great economics, but it likely can’t re-invest most of its cashflow into similarly high-ROIC opportunities. So it’s basically a cash cow. But _inside CSI_, these cashflows can be redeployed at high ROICs, making them a lot more valuable.





### Topicus & Vela Software Acquire Together (60/40) - August 2021

> CGG has entered into an agreement with Topicus and Vela Software [part of [[Constellation Software]]], for the sale of CGG’s GeoSoftware business [...]
> 
> The Geosoftware business will be owned jointly by Topicus and Vela, with Topicus owning 60% and Vela 40%.

Not really so strange when you think about it, especially considering that different groups and business units are sometimes competing for deals, but I don’t remember seeing this kind of joint-acquisition between operating groups of [[Constellation Software]] happening before.

Maybe I just missed it, or am not remembering it, which is certainly possible after 600 acquisitions…

Maybe they collaborated on it pre-spin, and it just happened after the spin because some of these things take time, so they split it.. could be just a transitional thing.

But now that Topicus is officially spun-out and more independent (than the already very decentralized CSI model) it will be interesting to see if we see more of it in the future…




### Resilient Business, [[Constellation Software]] Edition - August 2021

Above is CSI's organic revenue growth, by category, with foreign exchange fluctuations adjusted-out.

Through the pandemic, maintenance/recurring revenue (where most of the value is created) only went negative _one quarter_, and only by 1%, and it fully rebounded now.



### [[Constellation Software]] Shareholder Q&A - September 2021

It had been a while since CSI published one of these.

[This one](https://www.csisoftware.com/docs/default-source/investor-relations/shareholder-q-a/qa---september-2021---final.pdf) doesn’t have any of my questions answered (I didn’t ask any recently — most of the past Q&A have at least 1 question by me, if not more… see if you can recognize the writing style).

There’s some interesting stuff, and as always, Mark Leonard has a way with words:

> I suspect we are willing to be more patient with both existing and new managers than other software company buyers. We are permanent owners. **We don't need to find the reincarnation of Peter Drucker on roller skates to whip the newly acquired business into shape, so it can be flipped to the next buyer**.
> 
> This largely dodges your question about management attributes. I despair of answers that are some version of "intelligent, energetic, ethical". **I know some great business builders who didn't win the genetic lottery in the intelligence category but compensated with hard work and determination. Energy can be poorly channeled. Ethics seem to get pretty plastic under enough carrot and stick stress. I'd rather use a track record of consistently happy and loyal customers and employees to judge a team. That strikes me as a far better predictor of future performance than psychometric questionnaires or dowsing for cultural fit.**


### [[Constellation Software]] Q3 - November 2021

*drumroll*

-   Revenue grew 30% (7% organic growth, 5% after adjusting for FX)
    

Higher organic growth than Topicus (though the same after the FX adjustment). Probably not something we’ll see too often going forward…

-   Free cash flow available to shareholders +25%

You can see that at the very worst of the pandemic panic, maintenance/recurring went down -1%.

-   Maintenance and recurring +6% organic ex-FX (that’s where most of the value is created. Not bad at all. -13% on hardware sales, but that’s a lot of non-recurring revenue with small margins… Not every dollar of revenue is made equally).
    
-   During Q3: “A number of acquisitions were completed for aggregate cash consideration of $126 million (which includes acquired cash). Deferred payments associated with these acquisitions have an estimated value of $47 million resulting in total consideration of $173 million.”
    
-   John Billowits becoming chairman, Mark Leonard staying president.
    

Here’s what impressed me most:

> **Subsequent to September 30, 2021**, the Company completed or entered into agreements to acquire a number of businesses for aggregate cash consideration of $329 million. Deferred payments associated with these acquisitions have an estimated value of $41 million resulting in **total consideration of $370 million**.

Wow. They’re going to end the year with the biggest capital deployment in their history by far. Even if they didn’t do a single acquisition starting today until new year’s it would still be a strong year.




### Mark Leonard on keeping the main thing the main thing - November 2021

Friend-of-the-show [Sleepwell Cap](https://twitter.com/SleepwellCap/status/1463599796690853894) posted the above excerpt from the transcript of [[Constellation Software]]’s 2021 AGM.

I think it’s a good reminder to make sure to keep the main thing the main thing.

If you focus on creating value, you shouldn't target other things like organic growth or margins or whatever, even if these are often correlated with creating value, because that may exclude other good/better options.

For example, some companies with huge growth prospects may prematurely focus on profitability and leave a lot of value on the table over the longer-term. Some companies that focus on getting margins as high as possible may be creating a price umbrella under which competitors can come in and erode value over time. Some which are focused on growth in a slow growth market may be taking too much market share from competitors, triggering a lose-lose competitive response that destroys value for all involved when the alternative of growing more slowly may have let everyone win, etc.

The permutations are endless, and the only way to pull the right levers to optimize things is to keep your focus on the right thing, the end goal, and not some indirect KPIs that may be leading you in the wrong direction.

### [[Constellation Software]] Launches $200m VMS Venture Fund, Topicus CEO to be GP, Robin from TSS Takes Over Topicus CEO Role

_You know it’s a big announcement when there’s almost too many things for a single headline…_

> [[Constellation Software]] announced the **creation of a two hundred-million-dollar venture capital fund (“VMS Ventures”).  The Fund will provide financing for start-up and rapidly growing vertical market software businesses, most of which will have been either incubated or identified by a sponsoring Constellation business unit.**
> 
> While Constellation regularly invests in dozens of small initiatives and will continue to do so, VMS Ventures will invest in larger initiatives and take a different approach:
> 
> -   The Fund will only invest in businesses that have the potential to become standalone business units within Constellation.
>     
> -   The managers and employees of the Fund's Investees will be significant shareholders in their businesses.
>     
> -   The Fund will not back start-ups that have to rely upon a Constellation business unit for on-going sales, marketing, customer support, development, etc.
>     
> -   Many of the Investees' staff will be hired from outside of Constellation.
>     
> -   The Fund's employees will be compensated based upon the Fund's results.
>     
> 
> Investing only $200 million over a three-to-five-year period, Constellation does not expect the Fund to add meaningfully to Constellation’s organic revenue growth rate.  **The Fund's objective is to develop and refine organic growth processes which can eventually be rolled out more broadly by Constellation's operating groups**.  Constellation does not anticipate that the Fund will detract from Constellation's existing initiative programs nor its acquisition momentum.

Planting seeds for the long-term 🌱🌱🌱🌱

Speaking of keeping the main thing the main thing, clearly Mark Leonard understands just how much value could be created at Constellation if they can keep deploying capital in M&A at high rates of return *and* also increase organic growth (which, itself, is a complex discussion, because the aggregate company-level organic growth number doesn’t tell you all you need to know — they sometimes buy businesses that are in runoff and distressed assets, and while they create a lot of value by buying them very cheaply, it can also makes organic growth look bad. They’ll also sometimes cut business lines that don’t create much value at newly acquired companies, like hardware sales or professional services, focusing on the license and recurring/maintenance revenue where most of the value is. That can also make organic growth lower, even if more value is created. That’s why I tend to primarily track the “maintenance & recurring” organic growth line).

Here’s what Mark wrote in his 2013 letter to shareholders on the importance of organic growth (context is he was looking at DCF models of CSI and tweaking them in various ways to see which variables mattered most to long-term value creation):

> The more interesting part of the experiment was using the Consensus Model to do some sensitivity analysis and to look at alternative strategies. In all of the following examples, we assume that only one variable changes. In reality, our businesses are dynamic and changing one variable has an impact throughout the business.
> 
> **Varying the organic growth assumption has a tremendous impact on the intrinsic value of a CSI share. Add in another 2.5% organic growth to the base line assumption and you get more than double the intrinsic value. Subtract 2.5% from the base line organic growth assumption and you lose almost half the intrinsic value of the stock. You can see why so many software company CEO’s are growth junkies**.
> 
> For anyone who’s studied the industry, it is difficult to imagine a 5% perpetual swing in organic growth that doesn’t have an offsetting impact upon operating margins. That said, there’s still tremendous valuation and strategic leverage if organic growth can be increased with reasonable levels of investment. If managers have the discipline to monitor the IRR’s on their investments in organic revenue growth, then they’ve taken a critical step towards understanding the most powerful lever in software.

(Historical trivia: Around the time this letter was published, Constellation’s stock price was around $150 CAD per share)

Increasing organic growth in the VMS space isn’t easy because they’re operating and buying businesses that are inherently niche, have small TAMs, and are often in oligopolistic situations that make it hard to grow much faster than the space without triggering a lose-lose competitive response…

BUT, as Topicus has shown over the years, there are ways to grow VMS organically, either with new startups or by expanding existing lines, and based on what I’m seeing here, they’re taking organic growth as seriously as ever and are ready to keep experimenting with new ways of making progress on that goal.

Speaking of Topicus, another big piece of news:

> The Managing Partner of the Fund will be Daan Dijkhuizen. In addition to managing the Fund, he will continue to be the CEO of the Topicus Operating Group within Topicus.com, but will resign his role as CEO of Topicus.com.
> 
> Robin van Poelje will take on the role of the CEO Of Topicus.com in addition to his current position as Chairman.
> 
> Mark Leonard, President of Constellation stated: “Organic growth will be a critically important part of CSI's enduring success. I’m delighted that Daan will continue to lead TOG and will take on the additional responsibility for the Fund. TOG has one of the best track records of sustained organic growth at scale that I’ve seen in the VMS industry. I’ll personally support the Fund and Daan as he focuses on leading Constellation’s larger organic growth efforts.”

They’re still hungry, still trying to improve their game! No complacency at CSI — love to see it 🏋️‍♂️



### Mark Leonard’s 2021 Shareholder Letter 💫 ([[Constellation Software]])

When I saw that there was a new letter, the first one since 2017, it felt a bit like a mix of Xmas and a sighting of Halley’s Comet:

-   [[[Constellation Software]] Inc. 2021 President's Letter](https://www.csisoftware.com/docs/default-source/press-releases/letter-to-shareholders---february-15-2021.pdf)
    

It’s not totally out of the blue because the past few AGMs already touched on these themes and showed that management was thinking about these things, but it’s still surprising to see this type of course-change in our world of incrementalism, half-measures, and people afraid to change their minds.

Mark writes really well, so you should read the whole thing (it’s a short one, only 1.5 pages), but here are some highlights with my thoughts:

> **I used to argue that we needed to maintain our hurdle rates because dropping them for a few marginal capital deployments would cause the returns on our entire portfolio to drop**. The evidence supported my contention, so we kept the rates high for small and mid-sized vertical market software ("VMS") acquisitions and made very few exceptions for large VMS acquisitions. **The by-product of that discipline has been a perennial inability to invest all of the cash that we generate**.

If you’ve read the past letters, this is the “magnetic hurdle rates” theory.

> **I have stopped arguing. I have converted, and with the fervour of the newly converted, I am busy demonstrating my new-found faith**.
> 
> The obvious first step is to stop special dividends in all but the most compelling circumstances. That decision was made by our directors at Friday’s CSI board meeting. [...] if we are successful in finding better uses for our FCFA2S, the quarterly dividend will also be sacrificed

First, that’s good writing. Second, that’s what you want in a CEO. Someone who cares more about figuring things out and being correct than about being consistent or winning arguments. It’s a lot like [this thing that I keep as my pinned Tweet](https://twitter.com/LibertyRPF/status/1112351712709353473):



>Many see being convinced of changing a position as a defeat (my arguments were weaker, I lose this one...). Make sure you see it as a victory; you should *want* to be convinced by stronger arguments. Defeat is when better arguments *don't* change your mind.](https://twitter.com/LibertyRPF/status/1112351712709353473?s=20)[



Back to the letter:

> We will continue to invest most of CSI's FCFA2S in small and mid-sized VMS acquisitions at our traditional hurdle rates. [...]
> 
> we are working on two initiatives: **1) increasing the number of very large VMS businesses (i.e., those requiring multi hundred-million-dollar equity cheques) that we pursue, and 2) developing a circle of investing competence outside of the VMS sphere**.

This is big! They already said in recent years that they were increasing their efforts to go after larger VMSes, but this doesn’t sound like just an incremental twist on the intensity knob from 5.5 to 6.5, this sounds like a full Spinal Tap moment.

> We have invested less than 10% of our FCFA2S in this segment, making **only three  
> large VMS acquisitions during our entire 26 year history**.
> 
> Between **40 and 70 large VMS businesses are sold each year** [...]
> 
> We are **building a small, dedicated team at head office to pursue large VMS acquisitions and to work with M&A brokers**. If we drop our hurdle rates for these acquisitions, I believe that competent and diligent M&A brokers will include us in more auctions.

Mark mentions some of the advantages for some of these large VMSes in going with Constellation rather than a private equity buyer that will flip them 3-7 years later, and mentions that it can be a good fit “even if their ultimate objective is to eventually be a publicly listed company”. This has shades of the Topicus-TSS acquisition/spin and shows how creatively they are thinking about this.

Will we end up with a constellation (pardon the pun) of full and partial spin-offs and, maybe even channeling Malone/Maffei, tracking-stocks someday?

> If we are successful in acquiring one or two large VMS businesses per annum, then I anticipate that CSI's return on investors’ capital will decrease, but we will not have to return any of our free cash flow to shareholders.

As a shareholder, I welcome this because I trust them to still have a decent hurdle rate and to often over-deliver, but most importantly, _to adjust things_ if they find out that their approach doesn’t work out as well as they expect it to. I know that they aren’t empire-building or doing this for reasons that aren’t aligned with my interests, so I’m glad they’re trying new ways to create value.

But the other big part of this is also intriguing:

> **we are trying to develop a new circle of competence. We are seeking attractive returns, a sustainable advantage, and the ability to deploy large amounts of capital  
> outside of VMS**. That will require highly contrarian thinking and is likely to be **uncomfortable in the early going**. Hopefully, we have built enough credibility to warrant your patience as we explore new and under-appreciated sectors.

This is more out-of-the-box thinking, and I love it. I wouldn’t want most companies that are specialized in an area to do this, but once again, trust is an important ingredient, and I trust that they’re doing this with their eyes wide open to the pitfalls, and their brains fully switched on to figure the best ways to go about this and experiment in ways that aren’t bet-the-company, but rather more like R&D.

I’m wondering if the way to get into a new industry is, after studying it a lot, to make a “platform” acquisition that becomes the seed of a new group within the company, and using its pre-existing expertise, that platform can then do M&A and help head-office learn more.

Obviously, you only scale up what works, and there’s always risk of failure with bold experiments…
