# Low or no moat
The typical business you encounter during the day likely falls into this bucket, such as your average convenience store or insurance agency. 

These are perfectly fine businesses and likely provide employment within the community and a solid product or service to customers. 

However without a sustainable competitive edge it will be difficult to earn exceptional returns as an investor owning a Low/No Moat business unless you time the entry and exit well. 

Specifically the game plan has to be to buy at a discount (say $ .50 on the dollar) and exit at around fair value ($.95 â€“ $1.00) in a relatively short amount of time.
