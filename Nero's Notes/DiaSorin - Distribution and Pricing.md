### My questions are primarily from DiaSorin’s angle, and you have done some work on DiaSorin at [[Addtech]], then spent a lot of time at bioMérieux. Could you explain your background and then I will ask my questions if you don't mind?

I have a medical background and I have been working my whole professional career within biotech, medtech and pharma. I started my commercial career at Organon which was part of AkzoNobel. Organon was a pioneer in diagnostics and a very interesting company. They invented the ELISA plate and made the first conjugates for the HIV test and HTLV. They also made the first extraction system for molecular biology, with a technology called NASPA, which was also a pioneer in the field of PCR.

It was more precise than the technology from Roche because it was silica based and isothermic, so offered much better stability. Unfortunately, the company was divested from AkzoNobel who are a very large group with over 90,000 people. Their main business was chemical so they never understood the added value of having pharma and sold half of the company to Merck and the other half to bioMérieux.

At that time, I was the General Manager for Organon in the Nordic countries and I had the opportunity to continue with bioMérieux, where I became General Manager in the Nordics for some years, then moved to France as the head of the lab automation division. They were also interested in the journey because I had teams in the US, Europe, Japan and other markets. That was extremely useful for me to get that experience. After that journey of several years, I was head hunted to the Sweden group [[Addtech]], where I was the CEO of [[Addtech]] Life Science who have 18 subsidiaries.

[[Addtech]] Life Science created a separate NASDAQ listed company called [[AddLife]] in 2016. By the time I left the company, there were 35 companies in the group. I started my own company in Gothenburg, Sweden within genetics and have also been working as a consultant and on the board of several companies. Today I am mainly working on strategies and acquisitions, because of my extensive experience over the years, working with leadership questions.

### Is that how you overlapped while at [[Addtech]], marketing DiaSorin?

Yes exactly, not only when I was at bioMérieux but also because in the Nordics, LIAISON was one of the main competitors for VIDAS which belongs to bioMérieux.

### What do you think about the Luminex acquisition from DiaSorin, which has a big focus on molecular, where they did not have much presence prior to this?

Moving into that direction for DiaSorin was very important. I know that DiaSorin also acquired a smaller company in Ireland, called Biotrin. Making that move was very good, but the critical mass of that company was not big enough to build a competitive portfolio. We were wondering when DiaSorin would go into molecular and so the Luminex acquisition makes sense in many ways, including being clearer in the molecular biology area. Immunology is good but the market is changing rapidly, especially with point of care molecular biology solutions.

LIAISON is still a cost-effective system, so you do not necessarily need to switch into molecular for the same kind of tests because what you are doing may be good enough for a certain diagnostic test you are answering. Several years ago, everybody wanted to get into molecular platforms, but they realized two important things: work flow and cost efficiency. If it is good enough, you do not need higher specificity on certain tests, so you should differentiate your immunology and molecular platforms.

### Roche acquired GenMark with the same strategy. I have heard physicians in North America are more open to using multiplexing to look for 15 to 20 pathogens, as opposed to in Europe where physicians are not that enthusiastic, is that true?

No, I will give you my view about that. If you look to Cepheid and GeneXpert, by definition that is not really multiplex, but they have done a kind of multiplex with the GeneXpert. That is perhaps the closest competitor today. They have developed the Luminex technology for point of care and multiplexing and when bioMérieux acquired BioFire, this was the essence of having a point of care test where you have a broad panel.

But as you said, will you pay a premium to know 18 or 20 parameters or would you like to run more specific tests? You are correct because the US has more screening, which is why BioFire has been so successful there, whereas in Europe they want to be more specific. I do wonder who will win the race, but BioFire have done extremely well over the past year.

They have a broad panel but I do not know how it compares to Luminex. If you have an RSV panel and a gastro panel, for certain things it makes sense. If you are looking for influenza or an RSV virus that makes sense because if it's positive you would like to see more specifics and will be prepared to pay a premium price. If you would like to make a portfolio analysis for the different solutions, I will happy to help you with that, specifically saying which panels are good enough and will feed into both the American and European mindsets. Asia is not there yet when it comes to multiplex, but I have seen bioMérieux open an office in Singapore and they have won many deals in Southeast Asia. I am unsure of their progress in China, but GenMark, Luminex and BioFire are taking the lead with many other followers.

### One of the bigger factors in the US with diagnostic testing is reimbursement from governmental programs. Is that similar in Sweden or other markets you have worked in, and do you see any headwind for DiaSorin due to molecular pricing being higher than immuno?

The US has a more insurance-driven healthcare system. If you look at sepsis or susceptibility testing, you are prepared to pay a premium to get the right medication immediately because it costs a lot of money if you miss that. That is why Idaho started, the company who founded BioFire, because in the US you can easily get $150 but in Europe, they have been more reluctant to pay this and prefer to pay for immunology or molecular tests instead.

The reimbursement system is not driven in the same way and there are many differences in Europe, with the UK, Germany and Benelux being more similar to the States, whereas Sweden is more budget-driven. There is still much work to be done before you can fully position with a good reimbursement system.

### I did look at [[Addtech]] and [[AddLife]] when I evaluated companies in Sweden, but decided not to invest in either. [[Addtech]] does additional procedures before distribution but there were also certain products where they simply acted as a distributor and I assume DiaSorin fell into that bucket. DiaSorin keeps announcing new partnerships, for example with QIAGEN on latent TB and Lyme Disease, and with MeMed in Israel to discover bacterial disease. I am not sure who else has relationships with Roche, Beckman, QIAGEN and MeMed, but the company does not disclose who benefits. Did you ever see any of that from your standpoint?

Yes, are you talking about [[Addtech]] or DiaSorin?

### From DiaSorin angle.

Historically, DiaSorin has not had a clear strategy whether to go with distributors or having their own entities. For several years they founded their own subsidiaries in the Nordics. DiaSorin were always the immunology company and were not in those other areas much. Having these co-operations with the Israeli company who distinguish between bacterial or virus infection is interesting and unique because DiaSorin do not have a PCT or procalcitonin test because there are other ways of accomplishing that.

The Israeli test is expensive but it brings an added value for markets like the US. If you can distinguish between a virus or bacterial infection you save a lot of money and lives. You also mentioned the cooperation with QIAGEN, but they cooperate with many companies. They do not cooperate with Roche or Abbott but when I was at bioMérieux we also cooperated with them because they did not have a full molecular platform. We also tried to cooperate with DiaSorin but that was just before my time. It was a platform which was going to be a competitor to LIAISON.

### DiaSorin does not disclose how much they share with QIAGEN on latent TB or Lyme Disease; it has to be parsed through individually. How do you think about these types of relationships over the next five to 10 years?

There are many similar initiatives in the market today for co-operations, and the latent TB example is a win-win. In terms of who benefits, there is a co-distribution agreement. At bioMérieux we had that with Bio-Rad for certain instruments. CGEN sell the Bio-Rad CFX96, which is a molecular structure machine.

### So with that relationship, how did bioMérieux and Bio-Rad split that?

It differs slightly depending on what you are doing. In that case, CGEn bought the instruments at a premium from Bio-Rad, and sold the reagents. They do not need to make a big margin on the instruments because they make it on the reagents, so that is even more important. Bio-Rad also took the maintenance service income. They had special software which was dedicated for CGEn reagents, so one could not buy one system off the shelf and use CGEn reagents. Those kinds of co-operations are quite common in some areas.

### When distributing DiaSorin's products through [[Addtech]] in Sweden, was it reagents or the entire kit and what was the pricing differential between the two?

A distributor in Western countries would expect to have at least a 45% margin, otherwise it is difficult to have a good case. When it comes to diagnostics, the best strategy has always been to make the instrument as cheap as possible because your revenue is from reagents, which account for 90% of the total revenue. The instrument only accounts for 10% of total revenue and services are about 5% to 7%.

It is a business model similar to a Xerox copy machine or a Coca-Cola machine. For Luminex it will be the same, where they receive revenue from the cassettes they sell for multiplex. BioFire are doing exactly the same, placing systems and receiving their revenue from the reagents.

### What was the price to a lab versus a hospital, at bioMérieux or DiaSorin?

There is a market price for a new test which is difficult to define in the beginning. You need to see how much you can get for the product depending on the clinical value you add. It is not at all focused on the cost of goods. You should always look at how much value you give to your customers, then evaluate what they are prepared to pay, and subtract the distributor margin.

For example with this Israeli test, you calculate the clinical value and decide you can charge $150. If the cost of goods is only $15 it makes no difference, it is a fantastic business. But many companies are afraid and always calculate from what the cost is, then add a margin. It is very important to analyze that when pricing the market. It is much more difficult once you have put a price tag on a product or segment, to increase the prices later.

The beauty of this is that competitors will follow the market price because it makes no sense to decrease it to $30. This is a silent agreement when it comes to market prices but it is also a fun analysis you can make. The multiplex tests from BioFire, GenMark or Luminex are so expensive today because they can afford to have it.

### Relative to ELISA based tests, when Luminex and GenMark go to labs like Quest or LabCorp, do you have any idea of the pricing differential?

No, when you go to big groups like LabCorp, you need to analyze the market price. They will eat you up if you do not present a very good business case. If you have a me-too product, it will be even more difficult to differentiate your price. That was probably one of the hardest things to do when tendering with big groups in the US.

There are also big groups in Europe but they are much bigger in the US. If you have unique selling points you can charge more, which is also a good way of entering the market. For single tests it is difficult to enter the US market if you do not have a complete solution. If you are selling a full portfolio to many departments and a competitor offers a latent TB test, a big company can afford to decrease that price.

But when you increase something where you are alone, simply to get rid of a competitor, it becomes hard for small companies to enter the single test market. You can avoid this by going through good distributors, which in the Nordics are [[Addtech]] or [[AddLife]].

### Switching to strategy and particularly because of your experience, DiaSorin has historically been hospital centric in Europe and Asia, whereas in the US they are still lab centric. Quest, LabCorp and Sonic are more prominent in their business model. Carlo Rosa, their CEO, wants to transfer that concentration into hospitals. COVID and Luminex have helped in that regard, but is that a reasonable strategy and is it doable?

Point of care is growing due to centralized testing. DiaSorin has always used central labs because they had no point of care solutions prior to acquiring Luminex. That is where the market is growing, by getting closer to customers. The central lab thinking which was driven by Beckman Coulter, Siemens and Roche is still in some places but we are increasingly seeing many tests moved to the periphery or point of care. Today you can get the same quality results in a point of care system that you get from a centralized system.

An important dimension is that you get the results much faster with point of care. You can also ask a premium price if your quality matches that of the central laboratory system. Roche is moving in that direction and want a piece of the pie by wanting to buy GenMark. COVID has also increased the use of self-tests.

Healthcare systems are becoming less reactive. Today you can go to a pharmacy and buy all kinds of self-tests which have much higher sensitivity. I remember when I was in Organon, we had a pregnancy test and the general manager of the company was crazy when he saw you could buy a pregnancy test in a normal store. His fear was that, in future, you would find HIV tests in the pharmacies. This is possible but the next question is, what do you do with the result?

There are tests in the periphery which make sense and are cost effective, and there are tests which make sense to centralize. Clinical chemistry is okay because they use robotics and it makes no sense to do non-urgent tests in the point of care. There is a balance depending on what you are doing.

Many tests done in central labs can be done much better in the periphery. BioFire is sold to both central labs and to the point of care. When selling tests to point of care, you do not have the same expertise as you have in central labs; you need easier to use plug and play systems.

### DiaSorin developed five different COVID tests, until recently almost all of which were clinical lab focused. Abbott developed a 15-minute test, and so did Quidel. Who is closer to nirvana in the point of care solution in the diagnostic space?

It is a big race which you need to split when speaking about microbiology tests. Due to bioMérieux's legacy within microbiology, BioFire gives them a very good positioning today. CGEn also have very good multiplex technology but it is more for central labs. They are also working with point of care solutions but the Luminex platform is rather new compared to BioFire.

GenMark have not improved much yet. Never underestimate Roche because they have big muscles and already have many things in the periphery. Abbott also have a legacy in microbiology and are quite good. QIAGEN will also come up with something after acquiring a company with multiplex technology called QIAstat.

It will continue being Roche, bioMérieux, QIAGEN, Abbott and Becton Dickinson. Cepheid do not have multiplex technology but GeneXpert is well-positioned in the point of care.

### How did the management team at bioMérieux or [[Addtech]] deploy capital? My angle is as an investor, but an R&D specialist or executive has a different view. I evaluate management teams based on capital deployment, which can go into acquisitions, more R&D, or a return back to the investors. You spent more than 16 years at bioMérieux and got to see many other companies from that angle, including [[Addtech]] and DiaSorin, so my question is, is that an angle you looked at and can speak to?

I can speak freely about it because in the end, leadership makes the difference. Leadership is extremely important because without the right culture, good products do not matter. Culture wise, Roche is a very centric, hierarchic organization and not that agile. Companies like Abbott, Roche and even bioMérieux have not developed that much themselves. bioMérieux's milk cow came from Organon in the form of the BacT/Alert, which was a blood culture system. Both BioFire and VITEK were acquired companies, but there is not much from their own R&D.

These companies do not pay enough attention which frustrated me while there. It is a pity in a way because they have excellent capabilities but were too bureaucratic. They became slightly fat and happy, and no longer hungry to produce what the market demanded. That is a danger which happened to Kodak, Nokia and many others. Newcomers like GenMark and this Israeli company are very hungry and sooner or later will be eaten up by these other companies.

QIAGEN is a German family business who have poached many good people from bioMérieux. They have a good strategy and acquisition journey. Luminex's Dutch culture does not fit well with the Italian DiaSorin because the Dutch employ a flatter organizational form, whereas the Italians are more hierarchic. That could potentially be a conflict but it depends on leadership. When we acquired a company during my years, the most important thing was to understand the culture and drink a lot of coffee. It is like marriage; do not change the acquired company because in the end they were successful because of their people, not their products.

When we acquired companies, we always looked at the behavior of their leaders to see if they were good role models and walked the talk. You can feel that in an organization.

### The Luminex CEO will remain as an adviser and DiaSorin will end up with more employees in the US as a result of this acquisition.

That is quite interesting.

### Yes, but the senior management team have not been offered contracts. The CEO will stick around for some time as an adviser and then he will go. They are more acquiring the technology and the US centric relationship. I was also curious to see how bioMérieux's management team thought about capital deployment. For example, did they allocate resources to the molecular segment in the US or make an acquisition?

Companies like bioMérieux are more traditional and driven by certain individuals. I have seen companies who were able to move very quickly, like Danaher for example. Comparing the Thermo and Danaher models, Thermo acquire a company and put their flag up on day two. Very often they destroy the company culture and the integration process fails. Danaher keep the acquired company decentralized, speeding up both the integration and acquisition process.

The decentralized model like Danaher, [[Addtech]] or [[AddLife]] makes sense, because you gain from the knowledge of your acquired companies. Rather than destroying that, you get motivated people who contribute to the continued growth of the company, which is fundamental.

### You have hit on a very important point. I have generally avoided companies who grow primarily through acquisition, which was the main reason why I set aside both [[Addtech]] and [[AddLife]]. You said acquisitions are fine, as long as they are decentralized which allows them to do it more often. My fear is that it works until it no longer does, meaning they overpay for an acquisition or there are cultural issues or some other breakdown. I am more curious from the [[Addtech]], [[AddLife]] viewpoint, not necessarily bioMérieux or DiaSorin?

At [[Addtech]], we not only grew by acquisition but most importantly organically. The first priority was always organic growth, then acquisition. If your target growth is 15% or 20% per year, it is difficult to grow organically so fast, if you are not a very niche market. [[Addtech]] was established in 1906 and have acquired more than 400 companies. They have a good model but nothing compared to Danaher who buy much bigger companies. They are not very agile because they bought Beckman and Leica which are very big companies. Conversely, look at Siemens with DPC or Bayer; they acquired those companies and are still struggling with integration 10 or 15 years later.

### So it is partly the size; perhaps [[Addtech]]'s acquisitions were smaller making it easier to move onto the next one. I have generally stayed away from these acquisitive growth companies, primarily because of integration and cultural issues.

Yes, but it has very much to do with the management.

### With the management, yes.

That is extremely important.

### I am always learning more about portfolio companies and their competitors so it was very helpful. Before we close out, is there any specific point you think is worth highlighting, either from a bioMérieux or DiaSorin standpoint?

It is interesting how the market is moving, but most of bioMérieux's growth is from BioFire. The same will happen with DiaSorin; their grown will come from new acquisitions. DiaSorin's acquisition of Luminex allows them to offer both centralized and point of care platforms.

### Thank you again for your time, I will let Will Barnes know and I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated it. Have a great weekend.

Thank you and a pleasure to meet you.
