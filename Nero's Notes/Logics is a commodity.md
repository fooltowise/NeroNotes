# Logics is a commodity

Firstly, it doesn't always pay to be logical if everyone else is also being logical. Logic may be a good way to defend and explain a decision, but it is not always a good way to reach one. This is because conventional logic is a straightforward mental process that is equally available to all and will therefore get you the same place as everyone else. 

This isn't always bad - when you are buying mass-produced goods such as toasters, it usually pays to cultivate mainstream tastes. But when choosing things in scarce supply it pays to be eccentric.
