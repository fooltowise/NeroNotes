# The Selfish Gene
by Richard Dawkins

- A gene is a way for a protein (or a living being) to create another protein (or living being)
- A living being is a way for a gene to create another gene and replicate itself. A living body is a vehicle for a gene to express itself and replicate.


### Chapter 1: Why are people?
- The gene is the fundamental unit of heredity.
- The argument of this book is that we, and all other animals, are machines created by our genes. Our genes have survived, in some cases for millions of years, in a highly competitive world. This entitles us to expect certain qualities in our genes, a predominant one being ruthless selfishness.
- **An entity such as a baboon is said to be altruistic if it behaves in such a way as to increase another such entity's welfare at the expense of its own. Selfish behavior has exactly the opposite effect. 'Welfare' is defined as 'chances of survival'.**
- Examples of selfish behavior may be overtly aggressive, like the female praying mantis eating its male counterpart after breeding. More ordinarily, it may simply consist of refusing to share some valued resource such as food, territory, or sexual partners.
- Darwin's theory of natural selection has never been about the survival of the species or the group. If all the individuals of a species would be altruistic towards other members of the said species, there will always be at some point some individuals that refuse to make sacrifices. If there is one selfish rebel, prepared to exploit the altruism of the rest, then, by definition, he is more likely than them to survive and have children. Each of these children will tend to inherit these selfish traits. After several generations of this natural selection, the altruistic group will be over-run by selfish individuals, and will be indistinguishable from the selfish group.
- The fundamental unit of selection, and therefore of self-interest, is not the species, nor the group nor even, strictly the individual. It is the gene, the unit of heredity.

### Chapter 2: The replicators

- Natural selection is a particular occurrence of a more general phenomenon: what is more stable tends to stay around longer.
- Chemist have discovered that mixing exposing mixtures of water, carbon dioxide, methane and ammonia to light during a few weeks would be enough to create newer, more complex molecules. In particular, it is enough to create amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins.
- So at some point, it is conceivable that such a mixture led to a "primeval soup", where more and more complex molecules started to appear and breakdown.
- At some point, by accident, one particularly remarkable molecule showed up by accident: it had the propriety to replicate itself (most likely due to its affinity with other building blocks, or maybe also affinity for itself). Let's call it the first replicator. This led to a large collection of identical replicas.
- Among all the replicas, there is bound to have some replicating errors, especially over the long time. The mis-copying will be copied by nature. Those variations will either create more stable molecules, or hinder them. Little by little, more stable replicator molecules tended to prevail in the primeval soup.
- The process of improvement was cumulative. Ways of increasing stability and of decreasing rivals' stability became more elaborate and more efficient. Some of them may even have 'discovered' how to break up molecules of rival varieties chemically, and to use the building blocks so released for making their own copies. These proto-carnivores simultaneously obtained food and removed competing rivals. Other replicators perhaps discovered how to protect themselves either chemically, or by building a physical wall of protein around themselves. This may have been how the first living cells appeared. 
- **Replicators began not merely to exist, but to construct for themselves containers, vehicles for their continued existence.** The replicators that survived where the ones that built *survival machines* for themselves to live in. The first survival machines probably consisted of nothing more than a protective coat. But making a living got steadily harder as new rivals arose with better and more effective survival machines. Survival machines got bigger and more elaborate, and the process was cumulative and progressive.

### Chapter 3: Immortal Coils

We are all survival machines for the same kind of replicators - molecules called DNA - but there are many different ways of making a living in the world, and the replicators have built a vast range of machines to exploit them. 

A monkey is a machine that preserves genes up trees, a fish is a machine that preserves genes in the water; there is even a small worm that preserves genes in German beer mats.

A DNA molecule consists of a pair of nucleotide chains twisted together in an elegant spiral, the 'double helix', the 'immortal coil'. The nucleotide building blocks come in only four different kinds, whose names may be shortened to A,T, C and G. These are the same in all animals and plants. What differs is the order in which they are strung together. A G building block in a man is identical in every particular to a G building block in a snail. But the *sequence* of building blocks in a man is not only different from that in a snail. It is also different - though less so - from the sequence in every other man.


DNA molecules do two important things: 
1. First, they replicate, that is to say they make copies of themselves. This has gone non stop ever since the beginning of life, and the DNA molecules are now very good at it indeed.
2. Second, it indirectly supervises the manufacture of a second kind of molecule - protein. The coded message of the DNA, written in the four letter nucleotide alphabet, is translated in a simple mechanical way into another alphabet. This is the alphabet of amino acids which spells out protein molecules.

**The evolutionary importance of the fact that genes control embryonic development is this: it means that genes are at least partly responsible for their own survival in the future, because their survival depends on the efficiency of the bodies in which they live and which they helped to build.**

Sexual reproduction has the effect of mixing and shuffling genes. This means that any one individual body is just a temporary vehicle for a short-lived combination of genes. The *combination* of genes that is any one individual may be short-lived, but the genes themselves are potentially very long-lived. Their paths constantly cross and recross down the generations. One gene may be regarded as a unit that survives through a large number of successful individual bodies.

Our genes are doled out to us at conception, and there is nothing we can do about it. Nevertheless, there is a sense in which , in the long term, the genes of the population in general can be regarded as a **gene pool**.


The normal cell division into two new cells, each one receiving a complete copy of all 46 chromosomes, is called *mitosis*. There is another kind of cell division called *meiosis*. This occurs only in the production of the sex cells - sperms and eggs. Sperms and eggs are unique among our cells in that, instead of containing 46 chromosomes, they contain only 23. Meiosis is a special kind of cell division, taking place only in testicles and ovaries, in which a cell with the full double set of 46 chromosomes divides to form sex cells with the single set of 23. These 23 chromosomes are built by taking bits, for every pair of chromosome, of each single chromosome in a process called *crossing over.* Bits of each paternal chromosome detach themselves and change place with exactly corresponding bits of maternal chromosome.


**A gene is defined as any portion of chromosomal material that  potentially lasts for enough generations to serve as a unit of natural selection.** In the words of the previous chapter, a gene is a replicator with high copying fidelity. Copying-fidelity is another way of saying longevity-in-the-form-of-copies and we shall abbreviate this simply to longevity.

Because of crossing over, the shorter a genetic unit is, the longer - in generations - it is likely to live.  In particular, the less likely it is to be split by any one crossing-over. The average life expectancy of a genetic unit can conveniently be expressed in generations, which can in turn be translated into years. If we take a whole chromosome as our presumptive generic unit, its life story lasts for only one generation. What about the life span of a smaller genetic unit, say 1/100 of the length of your chromosome 8a? This unit came from your father, but it very probably was not originally assembled (i.e crossed over) in him. There is a 99 per cent that he received it intact from one of his two parents. Suppose it was from his mother, your paternal grandmother. Again, there is a 99 per cent chance that she inherited it intact from one of her two parents. Eventually, if we trace the ancestry of a small genetic unit back far enough, we will come to its original creator.

**The smaller a genetic unit is, the more likely it is that another individual shares it - the more likely it is to be represented many times over in the world, in the form of copies.**

Genes do not grow senile; they are no more likely to die when they are a million years old than when they are only a hundred. A gene leaps from body to body down the generations, manipulating body after body in its own way and for its own ends, abandoning a succession of mortal bodies before they sink in senility and death.

The genes are the immortals, or rather, they are defined as genetic entities that come close to deserving the title. We, the individual survival machines of the world, can expect to live a few more decades. But the genes in the world have an expectation of life that must be measured not in decades but in thousands and millions of years.

The gene is defined as a piece of chromosome which is sufficiently short for it to last, potentially, for *long enough* for it to function as a significant unit of natural selection. Exactly how long is '*long enough*'? It will depend on how sever the natural selection pressure is. That is, on how much more likely a bad genetic unit is to die than its 'good' allele counterpart. This is a matter of quantitative detail which will vary from example to example. The largest practical unit of natural selection - the gene - will usually be found to lie somewhere on the scale between cistron and chromosome.


What are the properties that instantly mark a gene out as a 'bad', short-lived one? There might be several such universal properties, but there is one that is particularly relevant to the book: at the gene level, altruism must be bad and selfishness good. This follows inexorably from our definitions of altruism and selfishness. Genes are competing directly with their alleles for survival, since their alleles in the gene pool are rivals for their slot on the chromosomes of future generations. Any gene that behaves in such a way as to increase its own survival chances in the gene pool at the expense of its alleles will, by definition, tautologously, tend to survive. **The gene is the basic unit of selfishness.**

Another general quality that successful genes will have is a tendency to postpone the death of their survival machines at least until after reproduction. No doubt some of your cousins and great-uncles died in childhood, but not a single one of your ancestors did. Ancestors just don't die young!


Evolution is the process by which some genes become more numerous and others less numerous in the gene pool. Sex and chromosomal crossing-over have the effect of preserving the liquidity of the modern equivalent of the soup.


### Aggression
Survival machines of different species influence each other in a variety of ways. They may be predators or prey, parasites or hosts, competitors for some scarce resource. They may be exploited in special ways, as for instance when bees are used as pollen carriers by flowers.

Survival machines of the same species tend to impinge on each others' lives more directly. This is for many reasons. One is that half the population of one's own species may be potential mates, and potentially hard-working and exploitable parents to one's children. Another reason is that members of the same species, being very similar to each other, being machine for preserving genes in the same kind of place, with the same kind of way of life, are particularly direct competitors for all the resources necessary for life. To a blackbird, a mole may be a competitor, but is not nearly so important a competitor as another blackbird. Moles and blackbirds may compete for worms, but blackbird compete with each other for worms *and* for everything else. if they are members of the same sex, they may also compete for mating partners. For reasons that we shall see, it is usually the males who compete with each others for females. this means that a male might benefit his own genes if he does something detrimental to another male with whom he is competing.


Why is it that animals do not go all out to kill rival members of their species at every possible opportunity?  
We can explain it with [[Games Theory]], and in particular with the essential concept of [[Evolutionarily Stable Strategy]] introduced by John Maynard Smith.


### Genesmanship

The key point of this chapter is that a gene might might be able to assist replicas of itself that are sitting in other bodies. If so, this would appear as individual altruism but it would be brought about by gene selfishness. The whole mechanism is called [[Kin Selection]] and has been first described by Hamilton.
