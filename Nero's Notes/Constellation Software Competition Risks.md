### I have been digging into Constellation more, how it works on the inside and how sustainable things are. We can start with how you got to Constellation, what you did while you were there and why you left?

I joined Constellation in 2010, as an intern. I was still an undergrad and then I joined right out of school in 2011. I was on the investment team in Volaris Group, where, over 10 years, I spent time doing execution and origination. My boss and I built the first dedicated origination team inside Volaris in 2012. I left Constellation in 2021 because I wanted to invest in higher growth assets and work with more ambitious management teams. A GP environment felt like the better place to do that, so I joined a London-based private equity who hold assets for five years before exiting. We are still looking to do our first deal and are raising capital for deals as they arise.

### When you say more ambitious management teams, are you referring to the management teams of the companies Constellation owns, the little guy?

Yes.

### I imagine that's a sleepy bunch?

> Constellation focuses on a great segment of the market which is niche businesses that are typically later stage. Because it's a full buyout without any further liquidity event for management, it self-selects the type of assets Constellation invest in. In our environment, there is a five-year exit horizon and, as a result, you can align the management's incentives to drive towards that exit.

### You mentioned the first dedicated origination team; does that mean you were only involved in looking for deals and when they came in you passed them on?

Initially, everybody did everything from sourcing deals to underwriting, then we saw an opportunity to split the two roles and have a team whose sole focus was to source deals and make a first call to a founder or shareholder to do the initial screening of whether it was a fit for Constellation. We primarily hired enterprise salespeople instead of those with a business degree or financial training.

### What was your take on the Asian opportunities for Constellation?

Australia is fertile hunting ground because it's isolated, the cost of labor is expensive, the need for automation is strong and they are also technically strong. The other East Asian countries, not so much. Each of them are different but the punchline is that we were too early in the Southeast Asian countries where the tech is primarily consumer-oriented and immature. Mainland China has no IP protection so it is very tough to do business there. The only place we found light was Japan, but it's a very different culture. Constellation has a joint venture relationship with Hikari Tsushin, but they have done few transactions. We were trying to do more but it is difficult culturally and you have to have local presence. We ultimately decided to stop that investment and, instead, prioritized Europe and North America. I was in charge of the global team and figured we would make more investments in Europe.

### We own Topicus, where I'm trying to get a better handle on exploring what the opportunities in Europe look like, whether they are as big as North America and what the hurdles are. Could you talk about the M&A process in European markets?

The process is the same but there are quirks in each of the markets. More face time and relationship building is required in Europe, and they like it if you can speak their language. In the US, it's transactional and you can do many initial meetings and even pricing discussions over the phone in the early days. Eventually, we started using Zoom and Teams, whereas Europe is much more high-touch. Germany is the hardest nut to crack in Europe and the one where you need the most face time. You need a German to do the target-facing part of the process, whereas France is open to people who look and speak a different language and still run the process.

### What are your thoughts on European competition?

The US is more competitive than Europe but there are different pockets. The Netherlands has Topicus, TSS and Main which is private equity. It's also more competitive in the Nordics. Germany has more software PE shops focused on the region. PE doesn't work that with the type of businesses Constellation would invest in, because it's hard to make three times money in five years using the PE play book. The competition tends to be PE-backed strategics such as Vitec in the Nordics and DL Software in France. Germany don't have direct competitors like Constellation, but there are consolidators who focus on particular verticals, such as healthcare. The pitch Constellation use is that they can give you global insights from industry experts. If we were looking at an insurance asset, we could learn many lessons form a bigger insurance company in our US portfolio. In rare circumstances, you get cross-pollination in terms of trying to help a German business get market access into the US.

### Part of Constellation's advantage is they have many similar businesses to the ones they acquire, which plays into the offer?

Absolutely. Part of the origination process to help build credibility would be to set up a meeting between a head of our insurance group and our target acquisition.

### What does Constellation do that is hard to copy?

One is reputation, which only matters in certain circles. Another is money, as they have plenty of cash to deploy. The final thing is process execution. In a way, all these things can be copied to a certain extent. Mark Leonard will be the first to admit we don't have the most enduring source of competitive advantage. With the right teams within Constellation – and there's large variation there – it's a well-oiled machine to deploy capital, and they have often already built a relationship with a target company. They obviously have the cash and they can point to hundreds of acquisitions they have done before. They bring former owners to the discussion to talk about their experience in any vertical and geography. The part which varies is the execution. The right teams know what they're doing and can do the due diligence quickly and are pragmatic about negotiating docs, which is difficult for the new kid on the block to compete against.

### Constellation did 134 acquisitions last year; how long can that continue?

> I've wondered about that for many years. I was talking to an auditor, in 2012, who told me it couldn't go on forever. While interest rates have been low recently and people were doing stupid things, the pace of new company creation exceeded acquisitions. I don't have exact numbers to prove this but that's what I feel. The database of tracked software businesses was increasing every year up until the time I left. We weren't scrubbing the database clean but it was in the hundreds of thousands of companies. Maybe a third of those weren't a great fit, but the number was growing, not shrinking.

### Was that because of adding new markets or even within markets, like North America?

Even growing markets within North America. I was surprised to find a new business in Toronto with $5 million revenues that no one ever heard of because they never updated their website. There are also $5 million software businesses created four years ago we never heard of, but those probably won't be a transaction for Constellation if they are still on a growth curve. VC money is drying out and nobody wants a down round, so it could be the right time.

### Were hurdle rates a frequent topic of discussion or pressure in your time?

Constellation is extremely disciplined with hurdle rates. Larger deals can accept lower hurdles but nothing has changed on the bread-and-butter deals. What has changed slightly as Constellation scaled – because Bernie and Mark no longer look over every deal – is the quality of underwriting and due diligence in the smaller deals, some of which aren't very good. Some of them maintain as before, but that's where you get some varied experience, but those are drops in the bucket for Constellation.

### You mentioned hundreds of thousands of companies in that database, how is that managed internally? Did you bump up against other Constellation units when you were looking at deals?

There are rules of engagement to prevent direct competition and actions which would not be beneficial to Constellation as a whole.

### What are the risks of this model or process besides some obvious ones? Running out of targets won't happen and the execution seems to be nailed down firmly.

> Things are getting more competitive, and there's a question whether other competitors will accept a five percentage point lower hurdle rate than Constellation. If that is acceptable, it becomes a race to the bottom. Constellation have a strong enough reputation and they have the capital, which attaches a premium to selling to them, but that only lasts so long. There could be a lowering of returns over time. Another risk is the quality of software businesses Constellation buys, which has declined on average since I was there. That doesn't show itself in the first few years; it shows up much later. These are businesses with antiquated legacy software with a handful of customers, which is like buying an annuity stream or a mine which gets mined dry over time. The risk there is their organic growth rates are not great. If that turns negative at some point, it will be a challenge to manage.

The nut Constellation is trying to crack is how to drive the businesses, most of which have enviable positions with customers, to modernize and invest in organic growth. That's another risk but also an opportunity. Constellation has an incredible culture and values and there's a lot of flexibility working for the organization. You don't need to be in the office and do XYZ because the company has a decentralized approach. Numbers and metrics matter because they are data-driven and logical.

> The issue is preserving the people. They have a strong culture with strong intrinsic motivation, but the extrinsic is missing, which is why I left. They couldn't keep up with compensation in the market. Decentralized decision making means it's up to managers of the operating companies or portfolios to figure it out, and there wasn't a lot of proactivity to do that. That is problematic for M&A which is the bread and butter of Constellation and you've seen several departures there. Times are no longer so good, so Constellation could suddenly be a great place to be. The trickier piece is how to incent CEOs and management teams to focus on organic growth, because the compensation scheme is not set up to motivate that type of behavior.

### Mark Leonard talked about organic growth when he acquired TSS, because they were good at that for whatever reasons. That acquisition was maybe to figure out the secret sauce there and get organic growth rates higher. When Constellation acquires a company, they implement price increases and value-based pricing, which should give organic growth a bump, but you don't see it on an aggregate basis, and as you pointed out, everyone knows the organic growth numbers are low.

Price increases aren't in all deals but remain the biggest value creation driver. Organic growth would be negative if you excluded price increases.

### I've heard people say that Constellation will acquire something that is slowly declining but they can still get the IRR to work?

That is correct but my portfolio avoided that. There are near term benefits but you hurt yourself in the long run. The compensation model is based on ROIC and revenue growth, and buying a shrinking asset hurts one side of the equation.

### You mentioned the quality of software businesses has declined; what points you to that and what do you mean by lower quality?

A high quality business is one in a growing market, it’s a mission critical application, has solid retention rates and good unit economics. That industry is early in technology adoption, so additional modules can be built and sold to the customer base. They also have a good product organization to do it with modern technology and are diversified. Constellation will avoid those deals because they are growing quickly and would attract a lofty valuation, which makes it hard to compete and to incent management.

The top-quality business inside Constellation are in very niche markets with TAMs between 20 and 100 million, and businesses you buy are already market share leaders in that niche. There won't be much competition because VCs won't invest as the TAM is so small. Because it is a mission critical application with great retention rates, you can drive it to be a high margin business. A low-quality business is the same minus the mission criticality and strong retention rates. The business could have had great retention rates over the past few years, but the minute there's a catalyst, such as a recession, churn goes through the roof. We want to avoid those businesses but deals are still getting done.

### There has been turnover due to compensation issues. Are they aware of that internally because I've also heard they monitor employee turnover and if a business has more than a certain turnover it's flagged as a problem?

People are aware of the issue. Inside Volaris, there was discussion around it and creative ideas suggested, but nothing implemented so far. There's a resistance to changing the model, but in certain cases people try to augment it. We might see a reckoning in the current environment with regards to candidate shortages, or it might persist to be a problem and there continues to be a brain drain. There are plenty of copycats looking for talent so time will tell. They could have addressed that earlier, to prevent the copycats gaining traction, but that won't destroy the shareholder value.

### Did you have any interactions with Mark Leonard or the team at HQ?

I met Mark six months after I joined and every year at the M&A summits. We were also in several post-acquisition review workshops. He is a smart intense guy who obviously built a fantastic organization the right way. I have huge respect for him.

### What about the other execs around him?

I spent a lot of time with Mark Miller who heads up Volaris. I also spent time with Bernie on deals and in post-acquisition reviews. I did not spend much time with Jamal. Mark always had an analyst, so I've spent time with several iterations of the Mark Leonard analyst, who have all gone to different operating groups or are no longer at Constellation.

### Do you have any thoughts on the TSS Topicus spin off?

Topicus TSS is interesting as they're not wholly-owned by Constellation, so they always had a slightly different spin. They didn't play by the Constellation rules, but Mark says those rules are there as guideposts. There's obviously proper governance where it is due, but they never had to source deals a certain way. Some of the wholly-owned groups misinterpret that over time. Because of the recency of TSS and their leadership, they did an excellent job in learning how Constellation does what they do, and used all those learnings to reflect on the geographies they play in.

The acquisition of Topicus and spin out showed the other operating groups what was possible in a way. Topicus is, by Constellation standards, a good, fast-growing business. They would buy businesses in a much more heavy-handed way to create revenue synergies, which is a dirty word inside Constellation. They were able to do it and part of the deal was to try to learn from that. The spin out also creating another listed entity with liquidity, which also showed others inside Constellation what was possible. They recently announced the Lumine WideOrbit spin out.

### These spin outs are possibly ways to re-energize or re motivate people because instead of having to make an impact on overall Constellation, you can impact a much smaller group, which might also help.

Yes, absolutely.

### What does Constellation 2.0 look like? Will they go into different areas or horizontal software or new avenues of capital deployment?

> That's a billion-dollar question. Constellation is already in horizontal software businesses. I wasn't opposed to doing those deals and we looked at some, but the challenge is valuation and how to build a sticky business with a great moat that will generate good profitability in the near term. That is hard to do when many of the horizontal plays are going after bigger TAMs, but they have already starting doing that. The model could be replicated in professional services if you can tech-enable those businesses. For example, wealth management has a degree of specialization and regulatory hurdles, it is local and all of those things provides a certain barrier of entry. Those businesses have predictable recurring revenue streams and tech-enabling those could drive better margins. You could then rinse and repeat and buy and build. There are other services businesses on the managed IT services, MSSP and MDR side that have similar characteristics. The trick will be finding the entry point and avoid going head-to-head with private equity.

### The challenge is finding something with similar returns to VMS. Those vertical market software companies are hard to find without inviting competition.

Constellation still have a tremendous amount of competitive advantages. More companies are getting created in different jurisdictions as they mature. The last deal I did was a Singapore business, and I didn't think I would find a business in a small island with a few million people. As places like Vietnam, India, Korea and Japan mature, more B2B software SaaS businesses will be created. They get venture funded and reach a ceiling because their TAM is small, and those are ripe for the picking. Over time, there will still be fertile hunting ground. The challenge with Constellation is, as they get bigger, more capital needs to get deployed, so they have to do a mega deal or get into a new market where they can keep up with the pace. The balance is trying to figure out whether enough software companies get created quickly enough for the capital to be consumed. If not, how much capital needs to be consumed in other areas otherwise they need to return the capital to investors, in which case the valuation won't be as punchy as it is today.

### That's a good place to end because that's, in a nutshell, the whole challenge. Whether they can meet it we'll have to wait and see.
