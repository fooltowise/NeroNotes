The implementation of a heap in the Java collections framework is referred to as a priority queue; 
the class is *PriorityQueue*. The key methods are:
- add("Gauss")
- peek()
- poll()

They are straightforwards, the latter two returning null when the heap is empty. It is possible to specify a custom comparator in the heap constructor.
