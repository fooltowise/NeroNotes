# Lessons from Nick Sleep and Qais Zakaria


- "The art of being wise is the art of knowing what to overlook."
- Sleep notes that information, like food, as a "sell-by" date. But some of it is especially perishable, while some has a long shelf life. This concept of shelf life became a valuable filter.


- When they analyzed companies and interviewed CEOs, Sleep and Zakaria probed for insights with a long shelf life. They sought to answer such questions as *What is the intended destination for this business in ten or twenty years? What must management be doing today to raise the probability of arriving at that destination? And what could prevent this company from reaching such a favorable destination?* They referred to this way of thinking as "destination analysis".

- For example, they wanted to know, *Is this company strengthening its relationship with customers by providing superior products, low prices, and efficient service? Is the CEO allocating capital in a rational way that will enhance the company's long term value? Is the company underpaying its employees, mistreating its suppliers, violating its customers' trust, or engaging in any other shortsighted behavior that could jeopardize its eventual greatness?*

- Sleep and Zakaria began to wonder what characteristics account for the success of companies with unusually long shelf life, and they would reach the revelatory conclusion that one business model may be ore powerful than all the rest. Their term for it is *scale economics shared*.


### Five lessons with a long shelf life:
- First, Sleep and Zakaria provide a compelling example of what it means to pursue quality as a guiding principle in business, investing, and life - a moral and intellectual commitment inspired by *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.* It is easy to dismiss quality as a vague and subjective notion, but it offers a surprisingly useful filter for many decisions. For example, it was obvious to Sleep and Zakaria that a low annual management fee that merely covered Nomad's operating costs was a higher-quality option than a fatter fee that would enrich them regardless of how they performed.
- Second, there is the idea of focusing on whatever has the longest shelf life, while always downplaying the ephemeral. This principle applied not only to the information they weighed most heavily, but also to the long-lasting companies they favored.
- Third, there is the realization that one particular business model - scale economics shared - creates a virtuous cycle that can generate sustainable wealth over long periods. Sleep and Zakaria took this one great insight and profited massively from it by focusing on a few high-quality businesses that followed a similar path. Paradoxically, they also argued that it was less risky for them to own a small number of stocks (usually about ten) than to own hundreds - a standard strategy that would inevitably have produced less dazzling returns. "We knew that we didn't know many things", says Sleep. "So it made sense to us only to have a few shares because those were the only things we ever understood and ever really knew."
- Fourth, it's not necessary to behave unethically or unscrupulously to achieve spectacular success, even in a voraciously capitalistic business where self-serving behavior is the norm.
- Fifth, in a world that's increasingly geared toward short-termism and instant gratification, a tremendous advantage can be gained by those who move consistently in the opposite direction. This applies not only to business and investing, but to our relationships, health, careers, and everything else that matters.
