If an animal is brilliant at survival, has an efficient metabolism, resists all diseases, learns faster than its competitors and lives to a ripe old age but is infertile, then its superior genes are simply not available to be passed on. 

**Everything can be inherited except sterility.**

Reproductive success is the the examination that all human [[Selfish Gene| genes]] must pass if they are not to be squeezed out by natural selection.
