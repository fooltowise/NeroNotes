We all spend a considerable amount of time and money [[signalling]] to *ourselves*: many of the things we do are not intended to advertise anything about ourselves to others - we are, in effect, advertising to ourselves. 

This is self-placebbing. We use the [[Placebo effect]] to convince our unconscious mind that we are high status and worthy of poursuit.
