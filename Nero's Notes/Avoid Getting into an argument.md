# Avoid Getting into an Argument

The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.

You can't win an argument. You can't because if you lose it, you lose it. And if you win it, you lose it. Why? Well, suppose you triumph over the other man and shoot his argument full of holes and prove that he is *non compos mentis*. Then what? You will feel fine. But what about him? You have made him feel inferior. You have hurt his pride. He will resent your triumph. You will have taken away his [[Always make the Other Person Feel Important| feeling of importance]].

*A man convinced against his will*
*Is of the same opinion still.*
