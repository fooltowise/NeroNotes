# Semi Conductor Industry

### Artificial Intelligence is a tailwind for the semi-conductors industry
- Until now, software written by humans were highly optimized to use the CPU in the most efficient way
- Neural Networks and AI in general is a bit different:
	- AI algorithms are not new and exist since the 1980s
	- What is new is the amount of data available and computing power
	- Training a neural network means doing a lot of simple steps at a huge scale, and GPUs are very well suited for this.
	- It is estimated that to improve the quality of a AI software by a factor of two, you need to train it with ten times more data and this needs as well ten times more computing power.
	- As a result, AI is usually six to seven times more computing intensive than software written by humans
- The computational intensity of AI makes it a tailwind for the semi-conductor industry.


### Cartography of the industry
- Intel is historically the big player. It makes principally CPUs and has the enormous advantage that until now all the software in the world were optimized for its x86 processor architecture.
- However, GPUs are becoming more and more important. They were initially developed for games graphics, but are now very well suited for AI and cryptography applications. The biggest player is NVidia, followed by AMD.
- Another big trend is ARM processors, found mainly in smartphones (and now in Apple laptops)

- Intel makes manufactures its own CPUs (and soon GPUS) from scratch, while AMD, ARM and NVidia outsource the manufacturing to Taiwan Semiconductors. However, recently Intel lost its advantage of always being one generation of processors in advance in regard to Moore's Law. Intel made the wrong technological bet for the 10nm technology, while Taiwan Semiconductors was successful with EUV lithography thanks to AMSL machines. As a result, Taiwan Semi is ideally positioned to become the principal manufacturer of semi-conductors in the world. If Intel is not able to come back from a technological point of view, TSMC will have a quasi-monopolistic position.


### What i do not like about the industry
- The industry is extremely capital intensive, and every two-three years you have to outlay huge amounts of capital to advance to the next generation of semi-conductors. If it is successful the payoff is massive, but if not the capital can be wasted in vain. How does it affect owner earnings?


### Other questions:
- How does it affect memory chips manufacturers? Why are all the famous investors invested in Micron Technology Inc, a manufacturer of DRAM memory chips? (Li Lu, Seth Klarman, [[Guy Spier]], Mohnish Pabrai, Prem Watsa, David Tepper...)
