We are wary of businesses where governments play a large role in determining corporate fortunes. Government actions, which are political and therefore often unpredictable, can both catapult a business to prosperity or cut it down. 

The issue is acute for companies that rely on fixed infrastructures such as telecom operators, utilities and oil producers, and mining companies. Since wiring, power plants, oil wells, and mines cannot readily be moved, governmental impositions - from carbon taxes to excise taxes on oil and mineral extraction - are neither predictable nor avoidable. 

Complacency about the role of government can arise when policies make a business artificially strong. Take the renewable energy industry in large parts of Europe. Before the global financial crisis began in 2008, generous government subsidies led many companies to think the renewable energy business offered great returns. The subsidies benefited the companies building vast solar parks and wind farms, and also created a tremendous boom for suppliers of everything from wind turbines to silicon wafers.

When times abruptly changed and governments realized they needed to cut costs, subsidies to renewables were ready targets. With a few small governmental decisions, renewable energy companies from Norway to Portugal went from explosive growth to near bankruptcy. Such episodes, which recur in history, are why government industrial assistance or protection should be viewed as transient, no matter how noble or long-term the government's intentions may seem.

Other scenarios calling for caution are those involving favorable government contracts. Although often lucrative while they last, such arrangements can be changed or renegotiated at government's whim, which often occurs if governments decide they are too favorable to businesses. The effect cap the economic upside in many areas when the government is counterparty.

This is a perennial problem with government concessions, such as mining contracts. While in theory concession companies are handed monopolies, monopoly-like profitability seldom follows over the long term. Aside from direct power to alter contract terms, government wields an array of tools such as taxes, duties, or regulation that can wipe out contractual advantages.

Businesses whose competitive advantage is tied to prevailing legislation or regulation face particularly serious disruption from policy shifts or changing legal interpretations. Even the most privileged positions can be torn asunder by a change in law.
