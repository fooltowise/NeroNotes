# Engagement - Flow 

Flow is engagement on steroids. Flow is that state of being in which time stands still, you're totally engaged in an activity, and the challenge of that particular activity matches up with your skill - so you're neither bored because it's too easy nor anxious because it's too hard. People describe this state of engagement as "euphoric", "in the zone", and "freakin' awesome". 

Flow was "discovered" by Professor Mihaly Csikszentmialyi, who has been researching this phenomenon since the 1970s. When he first described the state of flow, he had studied the detailed activities of thousands of people going about their daily lives and was able to isolate this very special form of intense engagement. 

People in flow report the experience as having these sorts of attributes:
- Experiencing complete involvement in the activity.
- Feeling a sense of ecstasy or euphoria.
- Having great inner clarity - knowing just what to do and how to do it.
- Being totally calm and at peace.
- Feeling as if time were standing still - or disappearing in an instant.

Flow can happen during almost any physical or mental activity, and often when both are combined. 

As the ultimate state of personal engagement, flow experiences have a special place in [[Designing your life]], so it's important to get good at capturing them in a "Good Time Journal".

**Flow is play for grown-ups.** In the life design dashboard (see [[Health Work Play Love Dashboard]]), we assessed our health, work, play, and love. The element we all find the most elusive in our busy modern lives is "play". You might think that we all have too many responsibilities to have much time for play. Sure, we can strive to have our work and our chores engage skills we like using, but face it - it's work, not play. Maybe. maybe not. Flow is one key to what we call adult play, and a really rewarding and satisfying career involves a lot of flow states. The essence of play is being fully immersed and joyful in what you're doing, without being constantly distracted by concerns about the outcomes. When we're in flow, that's exactly what's going on. We are fully present to what we're doing, so present we don't even notice time. Seen this way, flow is something we should strive to make a regular part of our work life (and home life, and exercise life, and love life... you get the idea.)
