## Sam's strategies for building a newsletter 


### The value of a media business

- The value of a media company is determined by the equation:
		How many people are in your audience x How much money do they have x How much can you influence them
Therefore, you should try to:
- reach a maximum of your audience
- make sure that you are in a niche where people have a high disposable income
- Be good at selling and convincing so that you can put in your brain what you want them to do (i.e [[Copywriting]])

### How to think about what you will write

Before writing any article, Sam will try to figure out, in this order:
	- Start with distribution: Who do I want to reach, and where are they?
	- From which medium are they going to come from? from search, from FB, Twitter?
	- What's the headline?
	- What's the story? Not only the story, but what is the emotion i am going to make someone to feel?

### How to choose your topic

How Sam finds which topics to talk about:
- He would look at subreddits related to his niche
- He would look at the top posts over last month in the subreddit, and also the most upvoted comment
- "I want to know what people are already talking about. What type of content is trending in my audience? And I am going to make my article touch on that, but be a bit different."

### On distribution

- Find first the communities where your target audience is
- Before doing anything, contribute to the community, and don't talk about your newsletter
- Write ten times good contributions that do not promote any product of yours
- After people have learned to consider you a legit member of the community, you can start posting good content in the community that will truly deliver value. "Hey, I've been following here for a long time, I run one of these companies, I think this subreddit is amazing and I actually noticed something that is really important/that everyone here is doing wrong." And then you post your content or a link to your newsletter.
- This should help a lot to grow organically -> you need to provide value!
- "Oh, and by the way, you don't want to click on the link to my site? That's fine, i actually copy and pasted it in this subreddit post. But if you do want to read it, the link is down here."






## Sam's process for his content strategy

- Your goal: make people FEEL. If they feel then they will act.
- Using first person is OK, sometimes even preferred.
- Your content is a journey. As if you're writing an episode of LOST. 

**The process (see also [[Write like the Hustle]]):**
1. Write the headline. It all starts here. 
2. Write the description
3. First draft
4. Incubate
5. Edit
6. Create the slippery slope
7. Cut
8. First sentence
9. Write simple
10. Post length - below 800 words or over 1'500. Not in between.
11. Short sentences, paragraphs
12. Don't use adverbs
13. Go back to your headline
14. Pick your image
15. Facebook
16. Copywork
