# Human norms depend on society structure

Our hunter-gatherers ancestors were very egalitarian. Hierarchy is alien to the forager way of life. But humans have demonstrated a cultural flexibility to evolve with their local environment. 

This flexibility enabled our ancestors to implement the huge behavior changes required to turn hunters and gatherers into farmers and herders roughly 10'000 years ago.

Farmers have [[norms]] supporting marriage, war and property, as well as rough treatment of animals, lower classes, and slaves. To help enforce these new norms, farmers also had stronger norms of social conformity, as well as stronger religions with moralizing gods.
