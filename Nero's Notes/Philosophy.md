# Philosophy


The word *philosophy* is derived from two Greek words, usually translated as "love" and "wisdom". A philosopher, then, is a person who loves wisdom and is dedicated  to the search for meaning. The pursuit of wisdom is an active, unending process of discovery. The true philosopher is filled with the passion to understand, a process that never ends.

Strictly for organizational simplicity, we can separate the study of philosophy in three broad categories.

First, critical thinking as it applies to the general nature of the world is known as *metaphysics.* Physics is the study of the physical world, tangible objects and forces in nature. It is the study of tables and chairs and their molecular components, of inclined planes and free-falling balls, and of the laws of motion that control the sun and the moon. Metaphysics means "beyond physics." When philosophers discuss metaphysical questions, they are describing ideas that exist independently from our own space and time. Examples include the concepts of God and the afterlife. These are not tangible events like tables and chairs but rather abstract ideas that exist apart from our natural world. Philosophers who debate metaphysical questions readily concede the existence of the world that surrounds us but disagree about the essential nature and the meaning of that world.


The second body of philosophical inquiry is the investigation of three related areas: aesthetics, ethics, and politics. Aesthetics is the theory of beauty. Philosophers who engage in aesthetic discussions are trying to ascertain what it is that people find beautiful, whether it be in the objects they observe or in the state of mind they achieve. This study of the beautiful should not be thought of as a superficial inquiry, because how we conceive beauty can affect our judgments of what is good or bad. 

Ethics is the philosophical branch that studies the issues of right and wrong. It asks what is moral and what is immoral, what behavior is appropriate and what behavior is inappropriate. Ethics make inquiries into the activities people undertake, the judgments they make, the values they hold, and the character they aspire to achieve. [[Stoicism]] for instance is a branch of Ethics.

Closely connected to the idea of ethics is the philosophy of politics. Whereas ethics investigates what is right or wrong at the societal level, political philosophy is a debate over how societies should be organized, what laws should be passed, and what connections people should have to these societal organizations.

Epistemology, the third body of inquiry, is the branch of philosophy that seeks to understand the limits and nature of knowledge. The term itself comes from the Greek words *epiteme*, meaning "Knowledge", and *logos*, which literally means "discourse" and more broadly refers to any kind of study or intellectual investigation. Epistemology then is the study of the theory of knowledge. To put it simply, when we make an epistemological inquiry, we are thinking about thinking.

When philosophers think about knowledge, they are trying to discover what kinds of things are knowable, what constitutes knowledge (as opposed to [[Beliefs]]), how it is acquired (innately or empirically, through experience) and how we can say we know a thing. They also consider what kinds of knowledge we can have of different things.
