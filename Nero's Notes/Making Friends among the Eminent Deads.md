Charlie Munger's affinity for Benjamin Franklin's expansive career in government, business, finance, and industry, can be found in his many speeches and whenever he holds an audience, large or small. At the seventy-fifth anniversary of See's Candy, Charlie said:

> I am a biography nut myself. And I think when you're trying to teach the [[Mental Models| Great concepts that work]], **it helps to tie them into the lives and personalities of the people who developed them. I think you learn economics better if you make Adam Smith your friend.** That sounds funny, making friends among "the eminent deads", but if you go through life making friends with the eminent dead who had the right ideas, I think it will work better for you in life and work better in education. **It's way better than just giving the basic concepts. **
