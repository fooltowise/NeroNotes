### Can you share some context to your role when you first moved into the buying team at [[Costco]]?

I was with [[Costco]] for 30 years and, about a year and a half into it, I decided that I wanted to make a career there. I went and spoke to my operations manager and let him know that I was interested in moving into buying, which meant relocating. He orchestrated some meet ups with that personnel and leadership, for me to tour the warehouses. Shortly after some of those meet ups, I was invited to fly to Washington, to interview for a couple of positions and I landed one of the two positions and started my career in buying.

### What made you realize that you wanted to build a career at [[Costco]], in those early days?

My friend was working at [[Costco]] and he said, there’s this new company in town. It pays really well; it’s a super cool environment and is like nothing you’ve ever experienced before. I went to see the manager. I walked in, all dressed up in the newest fashion, not realizing the exact environment, because I had never seen it before. They hired me on the spot. It was only temporary, to fill in, until I finished school. But I fell in love with the culture; it was amazing.

The camaraderie, everyone having each other’s backs. Super supportive and really a joyful place to work. I realized I wanted to make my career there but knew I didn’t want to make my career in the operations division. I wanted an office job; something that would exercise my brain more than my body.

### What was it about [[Costco]] that fostered that culture of camaraderie and everyone having each other’s back?

There was a great sense of appreciation for everybody’s contributions, every day. I remember clocking out from my shift, high fiving my team mates and having my manager thank every single one of us, as we left the building, for our contributions for the day. I had never experienced that before.

### It almost sounds so simple.

Yes; it’s super simple. But it just isn’t prevalent. It didn’t feel transactional. It didn’t feel like and employer employee transactional relationship. It felt meaningful.

### Why do you think [[Costco]] is unique in having that culture?

Jim Sinegal. He’s the Grand Poobah. He had one simple slide, every presentation he ever gave. He had multiple slides but one simple slide existed in every presentation; teach, teach, teach. If you don’t get that 98% of your job is teaching, then you don’t get your job.

### Teach what?

Everything; all of your knowledge. Anything you learn, you share, you teach, you propagate. We’re stronger together than we are individually. It fosters camaraderie and teamwork and breaks down the building of fiefdoms. Knowledge is power and he did not want power struggles, when he was trying to build a corporation.

### What was so unique about Jim specifically, that really enabled everyone to believe in or follow him?

When I first moved to buying, from the warehouse to Seattle, it was the time it was in Kirkland, and it was a two-story building. The bottom floor was accounting and IT and there was a café and atrium. There was then a staircase that was open, down to the atrium, with offices around it. There was a landing above it, on one side, which was the entry to the building and that’s where the receptionists were. You walked around to the left and there were the stairs down and a bit further down, on a landing area, he decided that open area, where everybody had to walk by, to either to the stairs to go downstairs, to get to the café, or go to their respective area in the company, that was his desk. He sat right in the center of that.

He was approachable, said hello to people and was ever present. He went downstairs and got his own lunch and mingled with everybody. He made it a rigid rule that he visited every warehouse, at least once a year, and listened to the employees in the warehouses, to hear what they needed and how they were doing, so he always knew the talent pool and they always knew there was an open-door policy. That open-door policy is written in the handbook, to this day. The walls were down; none of the executives have doors on their offices. Some of the high-ranking executives have conference rooms next to their offices, if they need to have private conversations. It’s a hot commodity to be able to find a conference room to go to because the whole thought is, it’s open concept, so everyone can overhear one another’s conversations. It’s an environment of teaching and gleaning, all the time.

### How did you see the culture change, over the years, as Jim moved on?

It has changed, for sure. Jim would never acquiesce to the shareholders, which were called the Street. He would get a ton of pressure, from the Street, to reduce wages or not give as high wage increases. He would get a lot of pressure to reduce benefits and that the benefits were just too lucrative; it was unnecessary to offer such magnanimous benefits to the employees. He would also get a lot of pressure from the Street to raise margins because the marketplace would buoy sales because the slope for value, for the shopper, would still exist if he took two, three or four more points, and he would be able to deliver greater shareholder value.

He wouldn’t do it. He would take his beatings, let the stock be beat to the ground, before he took it out of the backs of the employees or out of the baskets of the members. He would send memos out, talking about the pressure he was under and saying, I’m not doing it; you’re going to hear about it and the stock is going to suffer and I want everyone to know it’s the right thing to do for the long term. This is a decision that is part of our moral compass and it is a decision that the company is making, so we’re going this way. Nobody was afraid when the stock got pummeled.

### What’s different now is that the current CEO believes, and professes, his first boss is the shareholders.

Jim put the employees above the shareholders.

That’s the mission statement. The tenets of the company are, obey the law, take care of your members, take care of your employees and, ultimately, you will reward your shareholders.

### What makes you believe that the culture has now changed to put the shareholders above the employees?

I lived the transition. I felt it, because I started 32 years ago, with Jim being my CEO and having a tremendous amount of access to him. I also had a very strong and good relationship with Craig. After he took over the CEO position, Craig and I met to discuss something, and I had some concerns on a couple of key business topics. He said, I have a boss too; do you know who my boss is? He said, the shareholders are my boss. Jim would never have said that in a million years.

### What did Craig not understand about how Jim ran the business, that makes him feel like that?

I think, perhaps he remained silent through some periods and went along and supported Jim’s efforts. But that doesn’t translate into you necessarily believing in them.

### Also, it’s maybe just too tempting, in terms of serving the shareholders and trying to boost the stock price and getting caught up in that Street game?

In 2006, the economy was in a perilous condition; the government was bailing out car manufacturers and banks. At that time, Jim was so concerned about the members and the employees, that he reduced prices. It was a very small amount, at first, on key items such as butter, milk and chicken breasts; what are the items that people need to feed their families? We are a solvent company because we are fiscally conservative and we can weather this. We can afford to invest in margin and give it to our members. Our employees shop with us too, because everyone who works there gets a free membership.

When everyone started realizing this was a longer situation than originally thought, after about 90 days, he came back and said, I know we’ve done 10 items and then 20 items; I want 300 items. Granted, we are a limited SKU environment with 3,000 items. He wanted 10% of the items cut down to 5% margin or less. Before, it was reduced by 5%. Some of the items made 12% or 13% margin but, for that period, nothing could be over 5%. Some of them even went down to 2%.

It got to the point where he wanted some of them to be at cost and he wanted us calling our vendors, to find out about their solvency to see if they can lower their prices to us, so we can lower them even more. He wanted everybody working on this; it was our main mission, at that point, because the people needed it. He said that we owed it to our loyal members and employees, to be able to deliver these savings to them, because everybody was getting stretched thin and there was a lot of fear. People’s 401ks were collapsing.

Fast forward; he retires and Craig takes over. Fast forward again and the pandemic hits in 2020, 2021. No prices were reduced. If you read the reports during the pandemic periods – I know the work that was done because I was there for a portion of the pandemic and it was very difficult for the supply chain – no prices were reduced. Craig was very late to let employees work from home, even though there was no travel happening. Everybody was perfectly capable of working from home, doing well, being productive, feeling safer and reducing fear, stress and anxiety; all those things that have diminishing returns on people’s performance and their health and well-being. But he didn’t reduce any prices for the members.

He expanded some hours and made some shopping concessions, but there was no value given and people were losing their jobs. Many people went on unemployment, which meant significant reduction in salaries. There was no concern for people’s fiscal well-being.

Read the earnings reports for [[Costco]]; there were some of the highest sales and highest margin – not just margin dollars, but margin percent – delivered to the company, over that period of time. The stock was on fire. The employees were stressed out. Eventually, he let people in the office work from home, especially in certain divisions. When he started having them come back to the office, which he did, everyone was quitting.

### Post-Covid, it was 100% work in the office?

Yes; he called them back and they’ve been back nine months.

### Five days a week?

Yes. He called them back nine months ago or more.

### Why?

Because he wanted to be equal to the warehouse personnel who needed to go the warehouse, to interface with the members, so they could have operations open. In my mind – this is my opinion and my perspective – you put everybody at risk because you want to make sure that those that need to be at risk feel as if everybody is in it together. I believe we could have sent out a very different message.

### What was Craig’s rationale in not changing pricing during Covid when, as you said, sales were exploding?

He owed it to the shareholders to ensure the solvency of the company. There were so many unknowns that it would have been too high risk for his appetite to reduce prices. Also, part of the perspective was that [[Costco]]’s members are above the mean point where people were losing their jobs. They’re not the impacted people.

### Which, I guess, is also true, from the numbers they report?

More people became [[Costco]] members during the pandemic. There was an increase in memberships because people were looking for goods and the grocery stores were out. So why not capitalize on that?

### You’re saying more of the average earning demographic came into [[Costco]] because of the lack of supplies elsewhere and they want cheaper goods. Therefore, you represent more of the overall demographic anyway, so he should have decreased the prices, like Jim did?

I would say so; comparatively speaking, yes.

### How does he communicate, versus Jim? Given that it is a different philosophy, how does he rationalize or communicate that to the employees?

He doesn’t. There is an absence of communication. He doesn’t owe that explanation to the employees.

### Where did Jim even get this philosophy from?

I think it was his moral compass. He worked for Sol Price for a long time and he loved Sol’s business idea, but he hated the way Sol treated people. He wanted that business idea with the antithesis of Sol’s behaviors. He knew that Sol meant well, but he knew that you didn’t have to get results out of people by berating them. He knew you could get results out of people by respecting their humanity and he wanted to be able to do that.

He became CEO by meeting Jeff Brotman and Jeff liked the business idea. They got a bunch of people together, to get money, to open their first and only warehouse in Seattle, with the office on top. They thought, if we do 10 or 15 warehouses, we’re going to call it a huge success. Between all these people, there was a decision as to who was going to be CEO. Jim got two votes because someone voted for him and he voted for himself. It was important to him that the philosophy he had in mind became the moral compass of the company. It was fundamentally important to him.

He was a Christian and Jeff was a Jew; they both had strong moral compasses. It was just important to them that they spread more love, grace and loyalty than a transactional business relationship.

### What do you think Jim saw in Craig?

Business acumen, for sure. He thought that there were enough people that had been taught the core values of the company, that would be perpetuated and taught, that Craig had what was needed to ensure the solvency and strength of the company for the future. He thought that his moral compass wasn’t so bad that he would destroy the company or do something egregious to tarnish it and there were enough leaders and rank and file that embodied what Jim had taught. There was enough equity there to ensure that it would be perpetuated.

### Do you think he would look at that in a different way today?

I think that Craig spends Jim’s equity. I like Craig, as a person. I had an extraordinarily strong relationship with him. He is just not Jim. Nobody is Jim but he just doesn’t embody the same moral compass that Jim did. Once he got into significant power, it very much started to show up.

### How would you compare the way the executive team was structured and behaved around Jim versus Craig, today?

Jim was so loyal and so extraordinarily smart, but not intellectually smart in a superior way, where it was a condescending presence. Everybody sought to stop and listen to what he might say. He always presented it in a very gentle way. I can remember, one time, him being irritated with me, in a room. Because I spent so much time with him, it was not damaging. But I remember his gentleness was that he stopped reading what he was reading, because I was presenting him something, and I said something a little bit off-color. He stopped and he didn’t even move his head up. He looked over his glasses at me and looked at me right in the eyes.

I always felt like he was very fatherly to me, because I was so young when I started at the company. I felt as if my formative years were really under Jim’s leadership. I reflect on that and think, I am the person I am today and I am the person who raised the children I raised, because of the effects of Jim’s leadership in my life. They were so shaping. I feel so grateful that I fell backwards into this pile of goodness, to be able to be led by him for so many years.

My point being, he didn’t have to say a word to me. He just made it clear that he expected more from me than that by just looking in my eyes over his glasses. But then later, he would come up to me and put his arm around me. There was no shame. It was just always the sense of, I expect so much from you. If your parent gets mad at you or you disappoint them, what’s worse? He was really good at showing you he was not made at you but, boy, that’s sure disappointing.

### There are also incredible stories of him, about raising prices of the hot dog for example. Do you have any other instances that really stick out in your mind, of your interactions with Jim, that just define him, his culture and his philosophy?

People would say, why don’t your buyers raise the prices on this particular item; there is such a huge gap from the marketplace. He said, yes; my buyers could make $15 more on these jeans, and we’d still have a huge value. Fortunately, they know the rule about only making this much margin and they are dogged about always getting lower and lower costs, so they can have lower sell prices, so they can continue to have smashing authority in the marketplace.

If my buyer ever came to me and said, I can make this much more and we have this much margin and I can deliver this much more to the company, he said, I would look at them as if they had two heads and think, you’re working for the wrong company and how did we ever promote you to be a buyer. At the shareholder meetings, he would stand up and tell stories like that, because the shareholders wanted [[Costco]] to make more margin. He said, that is not what we do.

### Back to this question about culture and its evolution at [[Costco]], how have you seen Craig’s approach change around pricing, for example, and that gross margin target?

For instance, the Kirkland Signature water, the buyer, the AGM and the assistant buyer worked tirelessly, with the vendor, on this item, which goes in 98% of the carts, in the 16.9oz bottle of Kirkland Signature water that is in the 40 pack. They worked tirelessly to get to $2.99. This became the Holy Grail because $2.99 is unheard of. But the vendor wanted to make more margin and Craig let them take a 20-cent price increase – which is a huge percentage of $2.99 because the cost is $2.80 or $2.83 – and sold the product for $3.19. Jim would never have allowed that in a million years.

When you are building Kirkland Signature is all cost plus and there is visibility. Jim would have got involved and asked for update after update of how much of this is real and asked the vendor to give some and make less margin, because they were still getting rich. He would have had [[Costco]] make less margin because he wouldn’t have broken that price point and he wouldn’t have allowed the vendor to take that large of a price increase nor [[Costco]] to take that large of a price increase.

In addition, every item, in every region, in every geographic area stands on its own; that’s how [[Costco]] functions. Some regions make 12% on an item and some regions might make 8% and some might make 13%, depending on the distance from manufacturing. Craig let one of his SVPs, an executive of a division, talk him into weighting the average of the margin – not the cost, not the sell – to reach, say, 13% on an item if it showed a significant value in the marketplace. That meant some regions might make 10%, depending on their volume and some regions might make 16% or 17%, which is outside the bounds of the philosophy of the company that has been in force for over 40 years.

It created so much confusion for the executives in the regions, the buying teams in the regions as well as the executives and buying teams at corporate, that there is now this huge deviation from the guiding principle of the company, that used to be talked about as a Holy Grail and that a buyer wouldn’t even belong in the system if they did something like that.

This was all to be able to deliver margin, where the company always delivered value. They were a topline company in sales, so delivering value drives sales. But if you can take a little for yourself, it’s a huge deviation from the philosophy, the bedrock, the foundation.

### What persuaded Craig?

Shareholder value. Some regions were being penalized on some high-volume item because of their geographic distance to manufacturing versus others. In order to benefit that region’s P&L – although they operated under those expectations, they had all their goals based on historical data, which means they weren’t challenged to make more margin; they were always challenged to drive more sales – let’s deviate from a philosophy that is a driving principle of the company.

### For all these other managers that have been at [[Costco]] for 20 or 30 years, or longer, what do they think about these big things that are happening?

Some of them were like, so we’re doing that now? What am I going to tell my people? This is something that we have told them forever. We have legacy buyers that have been buyers for 25 or 30 years. Now I have to train my people that this is okay. At what point do we stop negotiating with our vendors, to get better pricing and deliver it in more sophisticated way to the market, to shave pennies out of the cost, to get a little more out of our margin, instead of marking goods up, in a price opportunistic price change period, so that we can have an amalgamated average margin and that region can have more money?

### Did he only do that for water or were there other products that rolled out to?

There are enough manufacturing sites for water. The point on water was taking a price increase and breaking a critical price point, such as the $1.50 hot dog. The $2.99 water was a Holy Grail, like the $1.50 hot dog.

### In your mind, with this weighted average pricing, there could be a risk that this is rolled out to many categories or many SKUs, across [[Costco]]?

Yes; it’s an erosion of philosophy.

### How does the buying team structure working with the merchandising team at [[Costco]], historically? How does that fit together?

At [[Costco]], merchandising is buying. Operations is the warehouses and merchandising is the buying division.

Merchandising is buying, so assistant merchandise manager is the manager over the buyers and their teams. I was a buyer, for some time, and then I got promoted to be over the buyers and their teams. I travelled with them, all over the world. I travelled all over the world and taught in all of our international regional offices. I would teach buying tenets. I was a foremost merchandiser for the company, to be honest.

### What are those core principles that you learned about, buying under [[Costco]]?

Quality, plus cost, equals value, which is not the same measurement of value for a lot of companies. That means that you should always be using a more sophisticated thought process and to be making the supply chain more efficient, so you can strip pennies out. Pennies matter and they add up, over time. You need to be in the manufacturing sites, with your manufacturers, looking at how they can become more efficient, because they should also share in those efficiencies. If you are able to find five pennies, through that portion of the supply chain, maybe the manufacturer keeps three and gives two to [[Costco]]; or maybe vice versa.

Always looking at, is this the best way to transport the goods to the marketplace? Transportation is very expensive and a really heavy load on the cost of goods. Never compromise on quality to get to those lower costs. It is always about creating efficiencies. It is always about a more sophisticated way of looking at things.

You don’t strip out quality to get to a lower cost. Ever.

### How do you measure quality?

You would measure quality compared to like items in the industry. There is a full-scope lab, on site, at the corporate headquarters. They would in the Kirkland Signature item, or the brand item, and then other similar items in the category and makes sure that all of the claims were accurate and check the efficacy of anything that was supposed to be deliverable and effective in and product, to ensure that it did, in fact, meet or exceed those metrics.

### Let’s say I’m a big branded supplier, such as Nestlé – someone in the snack or chocolate goods category – obviously, I’m a huge brand and have power. How would you approach a negotiation with me, in terms of sourcing product?

It depends on what the category captain was, from Nestlé, because they are across many categories. Let’s just talk about chocolate; say it’s a Nestlé Crunch Bar. That is maybe the category captain for them. You would do a competitive shop, across the marketplace and find out what the retails and deal times were. When you had them in to talk to them, you would talk about [[Costco]]’s volume and what kind of efficiencies that would drive for their system. You would talk about what kind of a gap could be created to reward [[Costco]] for those efficiencies in getting those goods to market, versus other outlets, where they are delivering goods in significantly less efficient ways and, probably, lower volume.

You would lever all of the benefits that your business provides to that supplier, against what any other one of their customers provides.

### If I’m Nestlé, I would have a SKU or a packaging or product size for the grocery channel and for the club channel, and the club channel would be [[Costco]] and Sam’s. How would you look to position [[Costco]], in the club channel, versus Sam’s?

There’s a law – called Robinson-Patman – and it’s channel specific. You have to demonstrate that you have key metrics that create efficiencies, that drive cost decreases, in order to get those, versus any one of your competitors in your same channel. You can also put your channel of trade against other channels of trade, demonstrating the same differences. If you have metrics that measure to your benefit, and you can demonstrate that, then legally, you can get a better cost.

### Which metrics?

More efficient packaging; more efficiencies in getting it to market; more efficient volume. For instance, if you are just going to run one SKU for [[Costco]], and you’re running 15 SKUs for a grocery store, and their volume on those 15 SKUs doesn’t even match your one SKU for [[Costco]], you’ve got 10 hurdles right there, that you’ve just crossed. Each one of those hurdles can have a value of X.

### How much does the packaging and getting it to market actually really matter, versus just the volume being so much better because it’s only one or two SKUs, versus 10 or 20?

Package is a really big load on the cost of goods. As a percentage of the goods, it’s significant. You’ve got the outer wrap and, usually, you would have some sort of cellophane. Then you may have some sort of a box and then each individually wrapped piece that the person was going to eat, which usually had two wrappers on it. For instance, say you have a 12 count that is going to the grocery store and you are going to sell it to [[Costco]] and you have a 36 count, you just cut your tertiary packaging costs by one third, because you are spreading it over three times as many candy bars.

Instead of putting it in boxes that need to be broken open and put on the display, you’re going to palletize it, which means you reduced the additional tertiary packaging, the costs associated with it and all of the handling costs associated with putting in on the line and putting it in one more package; who knows what other packaging it might go into.

Often, these stores don’t buy full pallets; they buy six cases. [[Costco]] is going to buy a finished pallet, in a full truckload, to one destination and then they will distribute it themselves. [[Costco]] distributes only in pallet quantities. They display in pallet quantities; they sell goods off pallets. Very efficient.

### At [[Costco]], do you have certain KPIs, as a buyer, that you have to meet, per SKU?

In sales or in value slope?

### Both.

Yes, you sure do.

### You would have sales, per pallet, per SKU?

A pallet has to earn its keep because the real estate on the [[Costco]] selling floor is very expensive. You would want to make sure that you had absolute pricing authority, all the time, on any item that you bring in. Then, that item needs to sell. It’s either a known brand that you already know has great market share and the members are looking for it, or it’s a new innovative item, that the member will be happy, excited and stimulated to put in their cart and take home. It’s called the treasure hunt environment.

### For example, it could be $5,000 per pallet or category that you have to hit every X number of times?

Every week. Sales are measured weekly and, in many categories, an item needs to sell $1,200 or more, every week, in one location. Put that across 700 locations. It’s a big business.

### You mentioned the value slope, so there has to be a minimum discount on that product versus the market?

For Kirkland Signature, it needs to be a minimum of 20% value to a branded item, either at [[Costco]] or at retail. A branded item, from [[Costco]] to retail, should have a similar slope. You have got to show pricing authority because your member, who is shopping with you, is paying to shop with you. There has to be an incentive for them to come and shop with you. They’re not going to come and shop with you if you are giving them the same price, on the same goods, that everybody else is offering.

They’re not going to shop with you if you are offering the same price calculated for a bigger sell unit, than they can get at retail, because you are asking them to invest more.

### Do you mean a bigger package size? Is that what you mean by sell unit?

[[Costco]] offers larger package sizes than retail, because those are more efficient. There is more usable content. As I said when talking about the candy bar situation, you might have 12 in a grocery store box, where you have 36 in a [[Costco]] box. It’s a bigger investment for the consumer, but they should be saving significantly on that because you’ve driven all of these tertiary costs out of the sell unit that you are offering them at [[Costco]].

### It has to be 20% at a unit level, not at just the package level?

Correct; candy bar to candy bar, for instance. It could be ounce to ounce, depending on what it is.

### What happens if you don’t hit that $1,200 per week target, per SKU?

You would get the vendor to mark it down, clear it out of the system and don’t buy it again.

### How does that negotiation process go with the big brands? Let’s say, you’re trying to cut cost and I’m Nestlé and I come to you and I want to take better margins, similar to the 20 cents water example? What is [[Costco]]’s philosophy in negotiation?

The vendor has to justify it. You can’t just come in with a cost increase because you want one. What creates confusion for the buyers now, with the little bit of break in philosophy doing the weighted average, is that they would push back on vendors if they came in with cost increases because they needed to reward their shareholders. For instance, say your sales growth is 2%. If you raise your sales price 2%, on top of that, next year, you are going to post a 4% sales increase.

Buyers are supposed to be sophisticated enough to understand what the vendor is trying to do and say, not in my house. You go and do that elsewhere; you’re not doing that here. Our member is buying a membership, to shop here, to get better value and they reward you by buying that inventory here. You go and take those price increases elsewhere.

### What about today when there is 8% inflation?

That would have to be justified because a very smart manufacturer has bought futures; they have inventory already put up their system, they have inventory on paper and they have futures that they can exercise. If they know that an inflationary period is coming up, their buyers should be sophisticated enough that they have futures in a large portion. They can either cost average with their lower cost goods that they already own and have manufactured, possibly with ingredients as well, or they could just ride it up. You work with them to understand their philosophy.

In order to make it to the buyer position at [[Costco]], you need to be sophisticated enough to understand the things that I’m articulating.

### How do you think pricing is going to change in [[Costco]], given we are seeing very high inflation today?

They should have been having these conversations with the vendor as they heard rumblings it was coming. They should have contacted the vendor to find out what kind of futures positions they were taking. What kind of positions are they taking now? Can they contract? What are their plans? Are they planning to cost average up or are you planning to ride it out until you absolutely have to take a price increase?

### Can you remember any examples of really high inflation and how [[Costco]] dealt with that?

I know inflation in some categories; certainly, in some commoditized categories, where there is pressure. Say there is a bird flu outbreak and everything that is farmed, that is a bird, gets slaughtered and so they have to regrow. You just work with the vendors. Consumers understand that, when those events happen, when you have wholesale inflation and you also have opportunistic price gouging – which is happening and it’s in the news and lots of corporations are getting called out for it – the [[Costco]] buyer is the gatekeeper for the member and they need to be having those very candid conversations with the vendors.

### What is the biggest challenge, as a buyer, at [[Costco]]?

There are probably two biggest challenges. Firstly, training your staff to have as sophisticated thought processes as you do, so that you can reduce your own workload and give categories to some of your staff that show promise, so that they can grow their buying and development skills and reduce some burden off your desk. That’s all part of the teaching process. In that, secondly, ensuring that your department, overall, all performers are working together, to meet the prescribed and approved KPIs for that year.

### How would you say that the role of the buyer has changed, at [[Costco]], under Craig, versus Jim?

I believe that there is so much pressure on the volume and moving goods from manufacturing to the market, that it used to be an inventory control specialist job and the buyer is spending more and more time helping the inventory control specialist chase trucks and get trucks to put under goods, to get to market. That means it takes their time and energy away from buying.

### Is that just a temporary problem, with the supply chain challenges that we are having?

There has actually been a snowballing effect that was happening even before Covid hit. It really snowballed over Covid and now it’s very consuming, post-Covid, because of how many drivers have resigned. There are not enough drivers, tractors, trailers or everything that is needed to get goods to market.

### Does [[Costco]] just use third-party haulage companies?

It does. It has depot trucks, drivers, tractors and trailers, but that is going outbound, from the depot, to the buildings. Coming from manufacturing, to the depot, that is all commissioned carriage.

### Just third-party players?

Everybody is in that pool. Clearly, [[Costco]] is a preferred commissioner but part of the problem is, because they are a low-cost operator, they don’t pay the premiums that people want. There is a lot of premiums being levied right now because there are so many people that can drive or carry a load. They are going to charge what they can because they know that they’re valuable.

### I just want to touch on Kirkland; one of my favorite brands.

Me too.

### Take any category that you managed, was there a certain target of Kirkland mix, as a percentage of total sales, that you would aim for or there would a limit on, in Jim’s time?

Kirkland Signature is built under a handful of tenets. One of them could be that a buyer has dreamed up an item, that no manufacturer makes, and they think it’s super important to bring to the marketplace. It’s going to go under Kirkland Signature and now they have to find a contract manufacturer and all those things happen. That comes out of innovation.

Another one could be that this category, or several items in a category, that pre-exists, but nobody is willing to take that item to the level of quality that the buyer wants to afford the member. They will then go to a contract manufacturer and say, here are all these branded items and I want these key elements, but I want to take it to the next level.

A third one is that there is a branded item where the buyer or cohort of buyers have just struggled and struggled to work with a manufacturer, to have not so much brand equity built into the cost of goods that they know there are significant savings to be had. They know that if the Kirkland Signature buyer couldn’t find a contract manufacturer to create the item that is just as effective as the brand, then it could be demonstrated to the brand, we know that it doesn’t cost what you are charging us to create this item and we believe our members deserve to have something just as effective as you have, and not pay as much.

Sometimes, when that happens – because it happens a lot – the Kirkland Signature buyer is able to leverage that item against the brand and get the brand to concede on pricing, to some level. If it is not a level that is the final level, or for a final period of time at the final level, then they will remain in Kirkland Signature, to continue to apply that pressure to that brand.

If it gets to a final level and it’s in perpetuity, then they may be willing to get out of Kirkland Signature. But the brand would have to sign documents saying, we’re not screwing around.

### What is that conversation like? You’re at [[Costco]] and you come to me, Nestlé, and you say, this is your price; I’m going to undercut you and I want you to manufacture it?

You do give the brand first right of refusal and say, I am searching for a contract manufacturer in this category; are you interested? That is the first knock; they should wake up and know, shoot. I know [[Costco]] has been talking to us about our price for a long; they are going to get after this category with their own Kirkland Signature. 9.9 times out of 10, the brand says, no; I don’t want to manufacture that; good luck.

### They don’t actually give in?

No, they don’t give in. Sometimes, they don’t give in until you launch and then you start eroding their sales. They then come back and say, we’d like to talk to you about a price decrease. They don’t say, it’s because you’re kicking us in the knees. They say, we were able to find some efficiencies and we want to honor the fact that you’ve been such a great partner, for so long, we came to you first.

It’s all high-stakes poker. All of it.

### In your experience, which brands were the toughest and which were the hardest to replicate, in terms of their products?

There are so many tough brands. They have built these big banners and there is so much pride in that. I would say that Tide, from Procter & Gamble, is probably one of the proudest brands I have ever known. Ever.

### Can you replicate their product?

Yes. [[Costco]] has Kirkland Signature laundry detergent and they have several different ones. They are very good and I don’t buy anything other than Kirkland Signature laundry detergent. It is just as effective as the Tides are.

### And cheaper.

Tide is $25 now. It is double the price. It’s ludicrous. [[Costco]] does show a significant value on the Tide they sell, versus the Tide that is sold in other channels of trade, such as retail. There is a justification there. There are some people that are so brand loyal to Tide, they won’t use anything else on their clothing. There is so much equity. The millions of dollars they spend, building this persona of their brand.

### What about snacks brands that you tried to go after and you couldn’t replicate and get the quality?

There are none that we tried to go after and we can’t replicate. There are zero. There are some very proud snacks brands, but there are none that [[Costco]] went after that they couldn’t do as well as, if not better than.

### Coca-Cola comes to mind as one where you can’t replicate the recipe. Coca-Cola does taste different from the private label stuff?

Actually, in blind tastings, that’s not true, and we did a lot of them. We did them with employees and we did them with members. The Kirkland Signature cola beat – just pummeled – both Coke and Pepsi. But because their brand has such heritage and it’s really divisive – it’s almost political, like the blues and the reds – that once you took the sleeve off and people realized that it wasn’t the blue or the red, they wouldn’t buy it.

### Would you know the supplier’s gross margin that they were earning on your products?

When they are manufacturing Kirkland Signature or their own brand?

### Their own brand that they are selling to you at [[Costco]] and you are haggling for price?

They rarely share that with you, but if you build Kirkland Signature in that category, you will know. You don’t know all of their manufacturing efficiencies or all of their costs to go to market. You give them a little on that but, generally, you know.

### What else is going to change at [[Costco]], in your mind?

I know that they are hiring leadership from the outside, where it used to be only promotion from within. Only, only, only.

### Hasn’t the board been there for a while?

Yes, the board is, but this is a philosophical difference from the senior leadership making decisions about, are we going to promote or are we going to hire from the outside? Part of it is healthy and part of it is not. They thought, are we cross-pollinating? Are we becoming too tribal? You want some cross-pollination for fresh ideas, but you don’t want adulteration. There is this balancing act that has to occur.

### But the model is so powerful and hard to replicate.

For all intents and purposes, and all the intentions Jim and Jeff had, it is fascinating and I don’t believe anybody has ever replicated it and I don’t know that anybody can. Truly, just going to market, to be in commerce, but doing the right thing by people first, is so lost in today’s marketplace.

In my mind, [[Costco]] is still years, in depth and breadth, ahead of any other corporation, even with the minor slip ups that they’ve been doing. Those minor slips, in [[Costco]], feel so big because it’s comparative to who they were. But comparative to everybody else, they are still in the Little League.

### How would you describe morale, broadly, at [[Costco]], when you left?

I’d say it was better than any other company. I would say there is an erosion of morale but there is also an erosion in morale across the United States, because of the pandemic and all the stresses that have occurred. You have to strip away some metrics to get to what is really going on.

They just did a raise for the employees but it is not meeting COLA so there are some concerns there. I think some of the negotiations that were happening on this occurred before the Fed started raising rates and there were changes in inflation. Although there were rumors it was coming so I don’t think handbook needed to be published, but I’m no longer there so I’m not an influencer in that. I do think they are going to have to do another one, sooner rather than later. They have enough money to do it and, I’m telling you, the employees are talking about it. They’re saying, we’ve gone big on our earnings; we have better sales; where is our leadership that says the employees matter first? We need COLAs.

It’s sad when you start hearing more than a minority of [[Costco]] employees saying, I have to get a second job. That was never the way it was.

### Don’t they still earn more than most other companies?

Yes, but the cost of living is so high now. Housing, transportation; everything. Is it incumbent upon [[Costco]] to bridge that gap for their employees? Jim certainly though it was. [[Costco]] is extremely solvent. They have a ton of cash on the books. Craig was just recently challenged with the question that, they have so much cash because of the earnings over the pandemic – not just shareholder earnings, but sales earnings – what are you going to do with all of that additional cash? You are already cash heavy; now you’re really cash heavy. He said, we have plans to spend it. The employees are saying, can you spend some here?

### Where do you think he’s going to spend it?

Expansion. New countries.

### What about online?

They’ve already spent a fortune on online. I won’t tell you the numbers because they are not published. It’s hundreds of millions of dollars.

### On the acquisition they made?

No; they did the acquisition but they built infrastructure to service online. They’ve expanded the team. They have hired very expensive talent from the outside.

### What is your view, broadly, on how [[Costco]] can navigate online, with their structure and their margin profile?

I think there is a lot of room to improve. I think there are several KPIs where there can be improvement. I think it is also a model that the senior leadership – such as Jim – were very honest about the fact they were late to the game. He didn’t realize it would actually have the staying power and the growth that it did. Craig is interested and involved but it’s just not their bailiwick, so it makes it very hard.

### How does the model work if you’ve got 14% gross margin and it’s a completely different supply chain? You’re packaging it and shipping it last mile. How does that work?

Pretty clunky.

### They’re offering two-day grocery now?

There is same-day and two-day. Same is Instacart. [[Costco]] was part of a big push to hire 110,000 Instacart drivers, across the nation. That happened in late 2019, early 2020. Those kind of side gigs are such a tough workforce.

### Let’s say it’s 2030, eight years’ time, what does [[Costco]] look like to you, in terms of store and online mix and how they are running online, specifically?

I don’t the stores are going to change much. I think they are going to keep percolating on the way they are. They are going to grow and be strong. I think that they have significant resources being dedicated to online. With Amazon suffering a pretty big blow, I think they would be wise to take good note. They are concerned about leakage from foot traffic and basket size in the warehouses – because those are brick and mortar – to online. It is my opinion that they should stop being afraid of growing online.
