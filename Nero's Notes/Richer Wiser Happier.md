# Richer, Wiser, Happier

by William Green

## [[Mohnish Pabrai]]

- **Clone like Crazy. Identify the most skillful player, analyze why he is so successful, then copy his approach with scrupulous attention to detail.**
- **Hang out with people who are better than you.**
- **Say no to almost everything.**
- **Treat life as a game, not as a survival contest or a battle to the death.**
- **Be in alignment with who you are; don't do what you don't want to do or what's not right for you.**
- **Live by an inner scorecard; don't worry about what others think of you; don't be defined by external validation.**

## [[John Templeton]]

- You have to buy at a time when other people are desperately trying to sell.
- Templeton had an unemotional appreciation for a mispriced bet that offered an asymmetry between risk and reward.

Six principles:
1. First of all, beware of emotions. Most people get led astray by emotions in investing. They get led astray by being excessively careless and optimistic when they have big profits, and by getting excessively pessimistic and too cautious when they have big losses.
2. Beware of your own ignorance, which is probably an even bigger problem than emotion. So many people buy something with the tiniest amount of information. They don't really understand what it is they are buying.
3. You should diversify broadly to protect yourself from your own fallibility.
4. Successful investing requires patience.
5. The best way to find bargains is to study whichever assets have performed most dismally in the past five years, then to assess whether the cause of those woes is temporary or permanent.
6. One of the most important things as an investor is not to chase fads.

## [[Howard Marks]]

- If you want to add value as an investor, you should avoid the most efficient markets and focus exclusively on the less efficient ones.
- Any asset, however ugly, can be worth buying if the price is low enough. Indeed, Marks believes that "buying cheap" is the singly most reliable route to investment riches - and that overpaying is the greatest risk. Thus, the essential question to ask about any potential investment should be "is it cheap?"
- The future is influenced by an almost infinite number of factors, and so much randomness is involved that it's impossible to predict future events with any consistency.
- When analyzing any asset, what Marks wants to know, above all, is the "amount of optimism that's in the price."
- We have to accommodate to the fact that the environment changes.
- The environment is what it is. We can't demand a more favorable set of market conditions. But we can control our response, turning more defensive or aggressive depending on the climate.

Five critical ideas come up again and again:
1. The importance of admitting that we can't predict of control the future.
2. The benefits of studying the patterns of the past and using them as a rough guide to what could happen next.
3. The inevitability that cycles will reverse and reckless excess will be punished.
4. The possibility of turning cyclicality to our advantage by behaving counter-cyclically.
5. The need for humility, skepticism, and prudence in order to achieve long-term financial success in an uncertain world.

## Jean-Marie Eveillard

Five rules for resilience:
- First, we need to respect uncertainty. Let's identify and consciously remove (or reduce) our vulnerabilities.
- Second, to achieve resilience, it's imperative to reduce or eliminate debt, avoid leverage, and beware of excessive expenses, all of which can make us dependent on the kindness of strangers.
- Third, instead of fixating on short-term gains or beating benchmarks, we should place greater emphasis on becoming shock-resistant, avoiding ruin, and staying in the game.
- Fourth, beware of overconfidence and complacency.
- Fifth, as informed realists, we should be keenly aware of our exposure to risk and should always require a margin of safety.

## [[Joel Greenblatt]]

1. You don't need the optimal strategy. You need a *sensible* strategy that's good enough to achieve your financial goals.
2. Second, your strategy should be so simple and logical that you understand it, believe in it to your core, and can stick with it even in the difficult times when it no longer seems to work.
3. Third, you need to ask yourself whether you truly have the skills and temperament to beat the market.
4. It's important to remember that you can be rich and successful investor without attempting to beat the market.

## [[Nick Sleep and Qais Zakaria]]

There are five key lessons from Sleep and Zakaria:
1. First, they provide a compelling example of what it means to pursue quality as a guiding principle in business, investing, and life - a moral and intellectual commitment inspired by [[Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance]].
2. Second, there is the idea of focusing on whatever has the longest shelf life, while always downplaying the ephemeral.
3. Third, there is the realization that one particular business model - [[Scale Economics Shared]] - creates a virtuous cycle that can generate sustainable wealth over long periods.
4. Fourth, it's not necessary to behave unethically or unscrupulously to achieve spectacular success, even in a voraciously capitalistic business where self-serving behavior is the norm.
5. Fifth, in a world that's increasingly geared toward short-termism and instant gratification, a tremendous advantage can be gained by those who move consistently in the opposite direction, that of delayed gratification.

## [[Tom Gayner]]

- Resounding victories tend to be the result of small, incremental advances and improvements sustained over long stretches of time.
- Make your mistakes non-fatal. It's so fundamental to longevity. And ultimately, that's what success is in this business: longevity.
- "*If you can continue to satisfy and be reasonable, there's all kinds of people that are going to fall away along the path, and it's amazing how high up in the percentile rankings you'll become. I was never the number one at anything. I've always just been steady and competent and able. But as my father said, the best ability is dependability. So to do it over and over and over and over again, it keeps you in the game. And it's amazing how you do sort of become number-oneish over time, just because the competitive field thins out so much...*"
- You don't need to be extreme to achieve exceptional long-term results. On the contrary, people get themselves into trouble with extremes.
- **It is the aggregation of marginal gains that's so powerful.** Moreover, the modest benefits generated by smart habits continue to compound over many years.
- **What we need is a selection of sensible habits that are directionally correct and sustainable - habits that give us a marginal advantage that will compound over time.**
- If there is one habit that many successful investors have in common, it's this: **they focus almost exclusively on what they're best at and what matters most to them. Their success derives from this fierce insistence on concentrating deeply in a relatively narrow area while disregarding countless distractions that could interfere with their pursuit of excellence.**
- **The art of substraction is incalculably important, particularly in an age of information overload when our minds can so easily become scattered.**
- The more distracted others become, the more of an advantage it is to subtract mental clutter, technological intrusions, and overstimulation.

## [[Charlie Munger]]

- He strives consistently to reduce his capacity for "foolish thinking", "idiotic behavior", and "standard stupidities".
- This is the first mental trick we should learn from Munger as a safeguard against stupidity: Imagine a dreadful outcome; work backward by asking yourself what misguided actions might lead you to that sorry fate; and then scrupulously avoid that self-destructive behavior.
- For a start, don't pay too much. Don't go for businesses that are prone to obsolescence and destruction. Don't invest with crooks and idiots. Don't invest in things you don't understand.
- The habit of actively collecting examples of other people's foolish behavior is an invaluable antidote to idiocy. In fact, it's the second great anti-stupidity technique we should learn from Munger.
- Nothing matters more than averting obvious errors with the potential for catastrophic consequences.
- Adherence to process is an indispensable safeguard. Always honor it because that' going to keep you out of trouble.
- The scientific literature shows that **hunger, anger, loneliness, tiredness, pain, and stress** are common "preconditions for poor decision making." Shubin Stein uses an acronym, *HALT-PS*, as a reminder to pause when those factors might be impairing his judgment and postpone important decisions until he's in a state in which his brain is more likely to function well. 
- There are four things that we know improve brain health and brain function: 
	- Meditation
	- Exercise
	- Sleep
	- Nutrition
