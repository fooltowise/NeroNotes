_Whose bread I eat, his song I sing._
*Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives.*


It always pays to consider the real incentives that are influencing our choices. We often tell ourselves that our motivation is based on goodness, or doing the right thing, when actually we are incentivized by the allure of rewards.
 
It is a problem for humans that we have a hard time turning down the pleasure of immediate gains, like a hit of sugar or a windfall in our bank account, in favor of future satisfaction and rewards. We often instead make choices that result in long term negative consequences. 
 
A doughnut may provide an immediate energy reward, but a doughnut a day for years will lead to long-term health problem. Making choices to maximize your satisfaction today often leads to less rewards down the road. 

Sometimes, then, it is beneficial to frame your choices in terms of the eventual reward you desire and evaluate incentives in term of their ability to get you there.

Knowing how incentives work to motivate us can help us be less easily manipulated. Advertisers know when we are more likely to be vulnerable and bombard us with incentives for short-term pleasure. Sometimes it is OK to give in. 

You're hungry, and those doughnuts look really good. We need, however, to be mindful of the power of incentives over ourselves and others as we navigate through the incentive laced territory of daily life.
