One common trap is thinking that having a differentiated product is a [[Competitive Advantage]]. While selling a commodity (i.e an identical product to price-sensitive customers) is to be avoided, differentiation is not a sure way to superior returns.

**What matters is barrier to entry**. You can have a differentiated product commanding a high price, but if there is no barrier to entry, many competitors will join your market. Even if there is no price war, your sales will diminish (because you will have a lower market share), and thus your fixed cost per unit will increase. This leads to decreasing profit margins, up to a point where nobody is able to extract a superior return from the industry.

This is what happened in the quality automotive market. While Mercedes is well differentiated and command a higher price, there is no real barrier to entry in this segment of the industry. As a result, many competitors entered the segment, such as Jaguar, BMW, Acura, Infiniti and Lexus. None of these automakers is enjoying superior returns. 

As a result, [[Brands]] are not enough to get a competitive advantage.
