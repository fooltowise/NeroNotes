### Paul, can we take a step back to the early 2000s when Tesco and online was first being launched. How was Aldi looking at ecommerce, back then?

Actually, Aldi was ignoring it. It was pretty obvious, right from the start, that delivering groceries to people’s stores or even simply picking themselves in the stores would add some cost. The Aldi mantra was, doing business at the lowest possible cost available. That didn’t include picking the products for the customers or delivering them to their home.

### Do you think their thinking around online has changed?

Yes, I think it has. First of all, the popularity and the consumer demand is much, much greater than it was 20 odd years ago. Technology has moved on so costs have become lower. I think that now, Aldi – and Lidl for that matter – see that maybe there are some products that they can’t sell through their retail stores, but they could sell online, so it’s actually an enhancement of the offer. Plus, of course, when you are an online retailer, you know much more about your customer than if they come and visit you. That’s is also attractive, in terms of what you can do with that data and how you can use it to help you run your business more successfully.

### How do you look at the potentially changing consumer habits around grocery? With immediacy players, such as Getir and Gorillas and other on-demand grocery, how do compare the shift between the weekly traditional shop and the more convenient, smaller basket sizes and more frequent shopping?

That’s an interesting question because there are two things playing out at the moment, one of which has been around for about a year and a half and that’s Covid. What has happened there is that the fear of mixing with other people has driven the consumer to shop less often and buy bigger baskets. That is a trend which is simply 18 months old and it appears to me that it is totally driven by Covid. If you look at the previous 10 years, it was going in the other direction. The consumer was coming more often, buying more fresh foods. They were more conscious about waste and, therefore, not willing to pick up large quantities. Pack sizes were also shrinking, so the whole thing was going in one direction and then, boom, along came Covid and changed everything.

At the same time, what Covid did was to offer consumers a way to get their shopping without actually going and mixing with people at all, by ordering online. For the first time, which is really critical for food retailers, they saw that customers valued this service. What I mean by that is, they are willing to pay for it. They are willing to pay something to have the delivery come to their home. Previously, there was a reluctance by many. That reluctance has certainly dropped, as a result of Covid. Now people have experienced not having to go and do their shopping, there is a percentage that quite like it and are continuing on with that.

All of that becomes a game-changer for a bricks and mortar food retailer. They could imagine, in the future, that people are prepared to pay for services such as delivery and that restores the profitability that was looking as if it was lost. If you had a perfectly happy bricks and mortar offline customer, that same customer, doing the same shopping, was less profitable if you had to deliver the groceries. That was really a problem for retailers. They were defensive in what they were doing. They were doing it because others were doing it and they didn’t want to lose important customers, as opposed to being really happy to do it.

The point you made about the guys who were doing the delivery service, these have also swarmed dramatically, out of Covid. If they weren’t delivering before online, it is actually quite difficult for a bricks and mortar retailer to get everything set up, to just plug and play with an operator who is doing it for many different businesses or even industries. Many of these players are delivering restaurant takeaway foods as well as groceries.

Of course, that means that their services are at a lower cost, because they’ve got a bit more scale to play with. I’m not surprised that that business has just shot out of nowhere, in the last two or three years, again, driven by Covid.

### Over the next five years, do you expect a higher proportion of sales volume to be the more smaller, convenience, topping up the fridge shops, as opposed to the weekly shops?

I think there is always going to be both. Quite where it lands is a bit difficult to say because Covid changed everything. That appears to be subsiding. All of the retail businesses that I am involved in now are seeing a gradual return to a more frequent shopper, with a smaller basket. We are not back to anywhere near 2019 yet. But neither are we at the peak of October 2020, when visits to supermarkets were cut by a third, and basket sizes increased by a third, which is really dramatic. It really changes a lot of things about running a supermarket.

This, coupled with the fact that all these new services have appeared, and they are probably adding 10% or 12% to the basket. But given that we are often talking about items under £15, that would only be £1.50 and it appears to be going unnoticed, from the consumer’s point of view, even though they are getting the service. I can’t tell where it will end, but it’s not going away, that’s for sure.

### Do you think the Getirs and Gorillas, these on-demand convenience players, pose a risk, longer term, for the big four and traditional grocers?

No, I don’t. I think it’s a service which retailers are watching and are part engaged in, because they are often providing the product, at least for some of these players. I am expecting that, if there is enough business in it, particularly in big cities, you will see acquisitions. You will see big bricks and mortar retailers just buying some of these players and absorbing them as part of their overall offer.

### Couldn’t they just roll out some of the delivery from the convenience stores?

You’re right; they can do it themselves. But when you buy somebody who is relatively small, even if you pay a large multiple for them, you achieve two things. Firstly, you get rid of a competitor and, secondly, you instantly absorb the business that they already had. Maybe it will be a combination of both, but the concept is not going away.

### Can we move on to look at selection and SKU count and range architecture? Historically, how has Aldi looked to optimize the number of SKUs?

The number of products that a discounter is selling is a critical number, to ensure lowest costs. There are several factors in play here. When a discounter sets up their business, they decide upon the range and then wraps it in a box, which are the walls and the ceiling of the store. The idea being that they don’t want to have to own or manage one more square meter than it needs to. It starts with the range size and it finishes with the store size.

Of course, once you’ve built your stores and you’ve got 1,000 of them in the UK, you are confined to that; it is not easy to just make them a little bit bigger. It can be done and most of the discounters have the opportunity to extend their stores. They are built like a Lego building block and they can put another 100 square meters. But it’s not possible to add two this week, five next week and 20 the following week. You’ve got to make a conscious decision that you are going to sell another 15% of product and extend your store.

Coupled with that, there is also the phenomenon called mixed cases. As a discounter becomes more powerful with its supply chain, it can actually sell two or three different items out of one case. That doesn’t increase the costs of the business. It puts some pressure on suppliers because they are now packing, for example, hazelnuts and walnuts in the same case; previously, it would have been one case of hazelnuts and one case of walnuts as two separate SKUs.

This mixed casing is going on a lot in discounters in terms of flavor variants and different options of similar kinds of products. If you look at the cereal range in a typical Aldi store, almost every case has got either two or three different products in it.20 years ago, that wasn’t possible to force on the supply chain without paying an additional amount for it which wouldn’t have been attractive.

### When you say case, do you mean an individual box of cereal having two different ingredients in?

When a discounter sells a product, what he’s really interested in is that product within a shipping case, because he has no intention of taking the product out of the shipping case, to present it to the customer. How it is made in the factory is how it’s sold in the shop. Whether or not that is a full pallet, which goes straight onto the shop floor and the first person who touches it is the consumer, or a full box, which is transported through the supply chain and placed on the shelf. It is hardly ever an individual unit.

Most supermarkets do it differently. They are actually taking the products out so this mixed case idea wouldn’t really be attractive to them. But for the discounters, it is a very attractive option and they optimize that as soon as they have got some scale and buying power, within the market in which they are operating.

### Effectively, you can use the same scale effects by getting multiple SKUs from the same supplier?

Yes. In effect, the store which I might have opened in 1999, with 800 SKUs, could now, being exactly the same size and exactly the same shelves and exactly the same cases, accommodate nearly 2,000 items. That increases the attractiveness to the consumer because there are more options, but it doesn’t touch the costs. The cost is, basically, moving that product through the supply chain and putting it in front of the customer.

### Does the supplier have to run two different manufacturing lines or are they just different variants?

It is almost impossible that the case doesn’t come from the same supplier. The attraction to the supplier is more volume. When you offer Rice Krispies and Coco Pops in the same box, you sell more than if you just offered Rice Krispies. Previously, you didn’t have the chance to sell 2,000 items because your store wasn’t big enough and you knew that you wouldn’t have as good a business proposition if you built the store twice as big.

The attraction to the supplier is more volume. The attraction to the discount retailer is not only more volume, but more volume without any material changes in cost.

### What is the ceiling on the SKU count, as these businesses scale?

Currently, I think we’re probably there. If you look at the diet of anybody, in any country, 20% of all the SKUs that are sold in the industry normally represent 80% of all the sales. That has been true for the last 40 or 50 years. What you see is that Aldi, Lidl or any other discounters, are able to pretty much cover that 80% of options. To start to go into the more fringe areas is not really the discount business. Once a discounter does that, it is starting to leave the path of discounting.

I don’t expect a dramatic change. You’ve seen, particularly in the UK for example, Aldi and Lidl fully mature, with their best possible offer to the consumer.

### Is that around 2,000 to 3,000 SKUs?

It’s an interesting question as to how many there actually are. There are just about 800 to 1,000 regular products. But there is another part of the discount offer which Aldi and Lidl are absolutely superb at which is, when it’s gone, it’s gone, WIGIG. In and out; special buys. They have lots of different names. Sometimes, people even refer to it as the middle aisle because it tends to be in the middle aisle of the store.

These products are on sale for between two and four weeks. They are launched at 50 per week and, in tense times, even more than that. There are about 2,500 to 3,000 products which are going in and out of that store. They are separate SKUs but they just don’t last very long. They are very seasonal and seasonally relevant and it’s a brilliant way in which the offer can be enhanced and be made very consumer-centric, because it’s what people are looking for that particular week. It encompasses food and non-food.

It is in this area that Aldi and Lidl see, with very attractive eyes, the option for online. Today, it is possible to buy a latest specification laptop, it is possible to buy quite a high specification cycle, business clothes, such as shirts and suits, and all at a pretty good quality, for a very good price. I can also see them thinking about – and they’re already doing it in some countries – fridge freezers, garden sheds and wheelbarrows. Things that would be really quite difficult to get in and out of a food store, both from the customers’ and the supply chain point of view. All of those things become possible if you have an online business.

### It’s funny, because you called it the in and out, because that’s also what Costco call their treasure hunt experience; they do the same thing. Do you see these two businesses converging, online, where they can almost buy the same products, with the same scale, from similar suppliers?

I think, if you look at the US and Australia, they already are. I’m absolutely sure that Costco are recording, each week, what Aldi is selling and expecting something similar the following year and thinking about how to compete and vice versa. This area of online looks really very attractive to the discounters.

### These in and out SKUs or products, are they typically overstock from manufacturers or suppliers or are they just seasonals?

When Aldi sells a latest specification laptop, it sells it through all 15,000 stores over the world. There is just not enough product for this to be some kind of gray market overspill. These products are bought up to a year in advance. They are carefully worked out with the supplier so that any troughs in production that the supplier might have can be utilized by Aldi, which gives them a good price. If you are a manufacturer for cycle wear, in China, you want the Aldi order because it is absolutely enormous.

### It smooths the utilization so it improves their margin?

Absolutely. It’s a very good business.

### Effectively, Aldi and Lidl can use these in and outs to really expand their range online?

I believe, and you can see that, in different countries, that it is already happening. In Germany and many of the Eastern European countries, the business is already doing that. In fact, Lidl is actually more aggressive in that regard than Aldi. They watch each other like hawks, so you will see that in the next couple of years, in quite a dramatic style.

### Which categories are the most difficult to enter with private label?

That’s an interesting question. The traditional answer would be personal care because anything that is some kind of health or beauty enhancement, the price plays a lesser role than if you are talking about an everyday food product. If you ask your wife how much she is spending on haircare, she will tell you to mind your own business because it’s not about price; it’s about whether it does the job that the consumer is looking for. Big, well-known brands dominate in these areas.

On the other hand, I have to say, it depends on the discounter’s presence and brand strength within the country. 20 years ago, if I would have proposed selling some private label hair coloring, quite rightly, the whole commercial team would have just laughed at me. Today, I think it’s possible, given that Aldi has a much stronger brand equity, that has been built up over those last 20 years. However, it is still the case that the latest developments and the R&D that comes out of the big players in the personal care area, means that they have the upper hand.

Surprisingly, by the way, pet food is also quite a difficult category. You can’t really tell whether your dog is going to live two or three years longer by feeding it the private label pet food, so maybe you had better not try; you had better go with the stuff that is always on the television. Pet food brands are very dominant.

Finally, there are one or two brands where the marketing is just so dramatic. Coca-Cola is the easiest one that springs to mind. Even if you could repeat the flavor perfectly so that, in a blind test, you can’t tell the difference, people still want Coke on the table because it’s iconic.

### Are there any examples, in the past, of categories which you entered but just failed, in food?

First of all, a discounter does a lot of research before it launches a product. I’m not telling you that there are never any failures, but there is so much testing going on, in terms of consumer testing and blind tastings, to ensure the product is to a certain standard. Every private label that a discounter launches has a benchmark. They know what they’re looking at, they know the stats from the benchmark and they are trying to repeat it. That is why the colors on the pack are, I wouldn’t say fake or rip off, but they are good at understanding how near to the line that they are near to go. In principle, a lot of research is done, to make sure that there are not many failures.

KitKat is an interesting brand and a really difficult product to make. To get the crunch of the wafer and the chocolate is really tough. 20 odd years ago, I tried with many, many attempts to get something that passed our taste tests, in comparison with the brand, and could never get anywhere near it. In the end I said, let’s contact Nestlé and tell them, in this case, they’ve got such a great product that we will sell their product. They never even returned our phone calls; we couldn’t get any kind of contact with them. I guess they thought we were rabble-rousers.

In the end, I imported the product, on the gray market, from Europe. In Europe, particularly in Germany, all chocolate has some level of hazelnut taste. But nevertheless, I imported it and sold it, reasonably successfully, in the stores. Then I suddenly got contact from Nestlé to say, they had got an enormous quantity of customer complaints about taste and that the product was contaminated with a hazelnut taste and they traced them all back to our store. As a joke, when the commercial team came to me and said, who is this company, they said, Nestlé. I said I’d never heard of them and told them not to return their call.

### Is the difficulty in making the product a mix between the ingredients, intellectual property and the machinery?

It’s a technical process. You’ve just got to do everything correctly, to end up with a chocolate covered wafer, where the wafer is not soft in the middle. Those guys are great at that and we couldn’t copy it.

### In that research process you mentioned, when you’re targeting a category or product for a private label, if you were advising a company – let’s take Goodfood or some of these online players who are trying to build an assortment of private label products – how would you advise them to go about their research process, in terms of which products or categories to target, in food?

If you’re a discounter, you’ve got a limited number of SKUs. You want the most sales out of your square meters so you go for the products that the consumer buys the most. One level further down, if you’re going to sell one ketchup, it would be anything but dumb to not sell something that is the best copy of the bestseller. This gives you your benchmark. As soon as you’ve got your benchmark, you need to make a private label which is as good as that. That is, basically, the discount private label philosophy.

There are some other ideas. There are businesses out there that pride themselves on having better than brands; fresher or organic.

### Such as Trader Joe’s?

Exactly. These guys go their own way but then, normally, you are not so conscious about costs and you are targeting a different kind of consumer. This can also work, but probably not at the same scale that a discounter would. It may be as profitable, because if there is no comparison to your product, there isn’t really a clear reason why you shouldn’t charge anything other than the profits you feel you need to earn, to make your business successful.

### Taking the Trader Joe’s model as an example, an online grocer that would go their own way. How would you compare the difficulties of building an assortment online versus offline, in that model?

The issues are similar but they are more critical online. When I go to my grocery store and something is out of stock, I’m staring at alternatives, alongside the gap on the shelf. I might be a bit irritated that my favorite product is not there, but I understand the situation and I make my choice. When I’m online, if I order something and I think I’ve ordered it but, actually, it doesn’t come, I’m really pissed off. I would have taken another option if I had known this product was out of stock, but the retailer was not brave enough to send me another option.

The problem with the retailer trying to choose the other option for you – and by the way, charge you at the same time – is also a minefield. Consumer A will choose the product to the left and consumer B would choose the product to the right of the out of stock item.

You’ve got to have products which you can be sure you have in stock. In order not to have a huge great big warehouse, with lots of product in it that might not always sell, you are forced to try to limit the range. Or you decide to have a huge inventory, but you can’t turn it over as quickly as a bricks and mortar guy. That is also a challenge to your profitable model. All of these things are issues for both bricks and mortar and online, but the whole in stock or out of stock situation is more problematic.

### First of all, they’ve got to have a very clean and up to date inventory management system, to understand what is available for the consumer when I’m shopping online. Additionally, they need the UI to almost encourage the impulse buying, that you seem to have in store, where I can buy stuff as I’m walking through the aisles, where it doesn’t seem as if that is as easy online?

There are ways of doing the impulse bit. You flash up to consumers things that you think are attractive for them. As you make a relationship with that consumer and they’ve shopped with you several times, you can begin to understand them and use artificial intelligence to tell you that consumers that normally buy nappies are interested in baby wipes, to state the obvious; but it can be more sophisticated than that. There was a very good joke made by one of the CEOs of Tesco, that their AI could now tell when a lady is expecting a baby before the husband did, because of the purchases she started to make when she was either just or hoping to get pregnant; some algorithms are able to detect that. That’s really important because young families spend more money when they move home or when they have a baby than at any other time. If you know which one is happening, you can make sure that you are properly represented in your advertising direct to them, to try and capture some of that business.

The issues about online and in stock and out of stock are compensated for by the possibility of learning much more about the consumer than you can ever do if the consumer just simply visits your store. The set-up of all that AI and getting the consumer to regularly start doing business with you, all costs money. Therefore, starting an online business is not for the faint-hearted. You can read all the start up accounts and they have to pour money into their investment, to get to a certain size, before they have any chance of breaking even and there are not many that have gone beyond breaking even.

### Which type of model do you think has the best opportunity of offering a new, pure play, online grocery model, in terms of the merchandising, the SKU count and the offering for the consumer?

Most of the businesses that are around in the world today, including the huge ones in terms of food retailing, do not make a lot of profit. Some of them have a lot of turnover and they have a lot of consumer data and they are constantly inventing more attractive intellectual property, but they are not supremely profitable businesses.

Food retailing is not a high-profit industry, anyway. It’s a low margin business, because it is very competitive and it’s just so large. Once you add the around 10% additional costs to serve the customer by being an online business, it’s quite difficult to make money out of that. But I think we’re seeing something that, every year, has grown; every year looks more attractive to more consumers. Each generation is using technology at a far greater level than the previous one. You would be mad not to bet on the concept becoming profitable in the future.

It’s more about the consumer willing to pay than it is about the businesses getting so much scale that they can cover those costs. I’m not saying that scale counts for nothing, but it’s not quite the same as driving double the sales per square meter, out of a bricks and mortar store. You’ve got to deliver everything, so if you’ve got twice as much to deliver, once you are an efficient operator, you basically need twice as many vans and twice as many delivery men.

### But you don’t have the store?

You’re right; you don’t have the store. Nevertheless, you can ask every CEO of a food retailer if he would rather serve the consumer with $100 worth of foodstuffs where the customer comes to him and buys it out of his supermarket, versus he has to deliver it and I know what the answer will be 100% of the time. He would much prefer the bricks and mortar version because it’s more profitable. Perhaps not if you are Ocado and you don’t have any stores.

Interestingly, you see even Amazon who are pioneers of online, bought Whole Foods and I don’t think they would have done that if they’d believed that there was a chance that online would replace bricks and mortar in food.

### Let’s take Ocado, as you mentioned. H1 this year, they reported 8.5% EBITDA margin; I know it’s part of a Covid year.

These guys are expert at the online business; I don’t think there is anybody better. The intellectual property is so valuable that they can sell it to other retailers around the world. The problem is, EBITDA isn’t everything. It is not net profit. You have got to invest a huge amount of money and a huge amount of capex and EBITDA does not take that into account. It redraws the comparison. You can’t take a pure player online operator and say 8.5% EBITDA, that’s fantastic; look, Tesco only made 7.5%. Tesco doesn’t have anything like the amount of capital invested that Ocado does.

I don’t think that scale is going to change things. The other argument is, the Ocado model is built for the large shop. It does well if the consumer buys upwards of £70 worth of shopping. If you order a pack of cigarettes, it’s a real problem for Ocado.

We are talking about someone who is really good at what they do and there is only a finite amount of £70 plus baskets available in an economy. Of the affluent, young working professionals, in big cities, they’ve already got a big proportion of that so it’s hard to see how the business is going to be super successful in the future, at a net profit level.

On the other hand, the intellectual property is fantastic. It’s becoming more copyable but, up until now, it’s state of the art and leading edge. You can see, by the valuation of the company, how investors feel about it. But I don’t think you can have 20 Ocados in Europe; I don’t think that’s possible.

### Do you not think that Ocado could win market share from Tesco and Sainsbury’s, in the long run? As more people want delivery they, effectively, have the selection online?

I actually see it the other way around. I think the bricks and mortar retailer, who will develop their online and copy the IP that Ocado has, is the challenger there. If I’m right and there is only a finite amount of really big baskets available, then that means competitors scrapping over those consumers. Normally, that means lower margins and it’s more difficult to make money.

### Why can’t Aldi offer 2,500 to 3,000 SKUs online, directly to consumers?

I’m sure, at some stage, it will, and there will be some kind of additional cost. Their model is low margin and lower levels of profitability than the industry average. Starting now, to work on something that is less profitable, when you have still got the opportunity to grow your business and get it into more towns and cities in which you are currently not properly represented in, wouldn’t really make any sense. Given that the idea is that it’s not as profitable for anybody, as bricks and mortar, I can’t see them doing it tomorrow.

What I can see them doing is enhancing that in and out business, because they already have a super business based on that and they could just expand the number of products which a business can offer, by offering items that are just too difficult to get in and out of a food store.

### In terms of how the supply chain works for Aldi, could we just walk through how a unit flows, from a supplier, to the end Aldi store? Is it cross-docked at a warehouse, at the intermediate stage?

There is almost nothing that goes direct to the store. 99.9% of the product goes through the warehouse. Firstly, that is important because, if you are a retailer of, primarily, private label products, you need to be checking them. You can’t just set up a specification with your suppliers and then completely trust that the supplier will do absolutely everything, every single day, every single week. That would be really quite expensive to try and do in 1,000 different locations; it’s much easier to do in 12 warehouses.

Secondly, a supermarket that is set up to receive things direct from suppliers to their supermarkets, you just don’t want that. You just want to deliver product from your own warehouse, where you’ve already checked it, you’ve already received it, you already know the quantities are right and you just want to ship it to the stores and get it on sale.

There are times when delivery drivers for Aldi, bring the product to the store and actually put the product on the sales floor, ready for the consumer to buy; it’s that efficient. You couldn’t do that in a warehouse and you’d never even seen the product.

### How would you look at a higher in and out mix online impacting inventory turns, for the likes of Aldi and Costco?

You need to understand that this in and out business is also a very mathematical and well-organized business. When you are selling 50 different items every week, in the stores, you need to be clearing the product in order to have the space to receive the next lot. Therefore, the intelligence that goes into ensuring that that space is there and the quantities are right is quite phenomenal. If it wasn’t, it would just become a system where the product is overloaded in the store. From time to time, that does happen with individual products but, generally, it’s a well-oiled machine.

It’s the same process with the online. For example, in Austria and Germany recently, Aldi sold a massive tool bench; something that a real craftsman would have. The thing weighed 200kg, was two meters wide and needed two men to shift it around. You would never be able to get that in and out in the store, but they sold it very successfully online and it was sold out in three days. I’m sure the second time that they sell it they will have a few more options, but it was very quick to deliver.

### There is minimal storage and inventory cost, at the warehouse level? These are almost getting shipped directly from the supplier to the consumer?

Yes; cross-dock means exactly that. It is checked and it’s on its way to the consumer.

### That would also explain why Costco are focusing a lot, right now, on the bulkier items online.

Yes, because that is simply something you cannot do in the store. They don’t actually want you not to come to the store; they want that additional sale, because you know you need someone to deliver it for you.

### It seems as if there would be minimal change required on the current supply chain for Aldi, to really serve online with a wider range?

You’re right, except you have to set up the online business. Once you’ve got the system there, it doesn’t actually matter what you sell, as long as you have got an understanding of how to run the system. That is what is new for both Aldi and Lidl. Five years ago, they just didn’t have that technology. There is a lot about your general product IT that has to be changed to accommodate an online model. There was a lot of upgrading of the discounters’ IT, in order to be able to manage that.

I once had an interesting conversation with quite a famous online clothing retailer. I asked why they didn’t buy someone with a bricks and mortar business and combine it and have all the knowledge they’ve got, rather than starting on their own. They said, IT; they just don’t have the IT necessary. They would be buying the company and, basically, scrapping all the IT and having to renew it and it would be too expensive; it’s better to just grow it themselves. The IT capability needed to run an online business is much, much greater than bricks and mortar ever needed.

### How did you look at the potential opportunity for click and collect, for Aldi and Lidl, online?

I think that’s probably less attractive to them. If some element of Covid sticks, there may be some consumers who say, I don’t need the product to be delivered; in fact, it’s a bit awkward for me to have to be in when the delivery is supposed to come; I don’t have a convenient place for you to leave it. I would like to collect it somewhere in this time window and, if that was big enough, maybe they would consider it. There is less cost for the retailer if you don’t have to deliver it and just have to pick it and leave it in some kind of external collection post.

These things also have costs to them because you can’t put bananas in the same container as frozen food; you need a multi-temperature way to serve the consumer. I think it’s possible, but I don’t believe it’s on the agenda. They would much rather stick to items where they are getting additional sales. I could see, in a fully mature business, where you believe you have put the right number of stores into a country and any more is just going to cause cannibalization, then it might be considered, if the consumer is prepared to pay some additional cost for the services of either click and collect or delivery.

### Let’s say, looking forward over the next 10 years, some of the big questions around Costco and the grocery discounters are really around how the consumers are changing. In 10 years’ time, how do you see the relevance of Costco or Aldi’s discounter model changing?

I think it’s too resilient and strong. When you sell things which are good and are the same quality as the market is looking for, and you sell them cheaper than anybody else, you’ve got yourself a market. I can’t believe that that mantra will change in the future. If anybody argues to me, what about better quality, the discounters can always increase their quality if they believe that is what the consumers want. They’ve always focused on what the best seller is. If the best seller is suddenly a new level of quality, then they will simply change to that. They are very flexible from that point of view.

These businesses have proved resilient, to move with the times for the consumer’s expectation. They have the lowest costs so they can provide the lowest prices and that is tremendously resilient.

You’ve got to realize, with a discounter like Aldi or Lidl, they are always thinking to themselves, one option is to increase my market share, in country X, Y or Z – and they are in many, many countries around the world – by offering additional services or I could spend the money going to a market where I am just not represented at all and grab a big chunk of market share like I have done everywhere else. That always looks more attractive to Aldi and Lidl, than doing something totally complex that, in some ways, actually contradicts the business model, by adding costs.

### If you were running a big four UK grocer today, how would you be looking at online?

Online is now a critical part of being a huge, full service, supermarket business. You cannot ignore it. You have to work very hard to have a model which delivers exactly what the consumer wants. There is a very interesting survey, out today, by _Which?_, where they really went into some details to look at customer satisfaction. They found a lot of holes in some very famous companies. Firstly, I would be focusing on doing that well. Secondly, I would be finding ways in which the consumer is so impressed with the service that they are willing to pay some kind of subscription or give something for that service, because they really value it. I would be trying to ensure that the lifetime value of a consumer is both protected for that particular retailer and profitability maximized, when you consider that many of these consumers, both shop online and offline, according to their needs. You are just trying to make sure that you are servicing that customer as best as you can, so they don’t choose somebody else.

### Would you be looking to fulfil those online orders from your own bricks and mortar stores, from dark stores or from an Ocado CFC model?

I’m almost sure I wouldn’t go down the Ocado route. Whether you use dark stores or your own stores, a lot depends on geography. If I’m in the middle of London, I may choose a different option from if I am in the Highlands of Scotland. It is according to what is the best, lowest cost way in which I can fulfil the orders, in a way where the consumer is totally satisfied.

Using your own stores is the cheapest model, but it’s the most complicated. Most retailers do exactly what you were talking about earlier; as soon as the stock level falls below a certain point, they take it off their online and you can’t order that product that day. Let’s say you got 15 or 20 packets of a slow seller left in your store, you suddenly make it unavailable for somebody online. But what happens if it’s a busy time and there are 50 packets in people’s trollies that haven’t yet got through the checkout? Then your system is skewered. There are lots of things like that where it is complex to overcome the online stock situation.

Coupled with that, if you pick an online order, it’s much, much quicker in a dark store than if you pick it in a supermarket, which is laid out for making sure that the customer travails the entire store and sees all the options in a logical way, so that they can do their shopping properly. That’s not the ideal way in which you can pick an online order, but necessary if you’re going to do it out of the stores and it’s only possible and profitable in a dark store if you’ve got enough business going in and out of it.

### Why do you think the big four don’t use Ocado today?

It’s not really true. Over a period of time, Ocado has had a relationship with a number of the top grocers, as they ramped up their own online. Essentially, retailers – like Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Asda – want to control the whole process. Working with partners is not an easy thing to do, and have absolute day by day control. Of course, Ocado has a different shareholder, in M&S, and so it is just not possible.

They have flirted with them; they have learnt a lot and they believe that they are doing things in a way that can fulfil what I mentioned; to make sure that there is total customer satisfaction and do it at the lowest possible cost and in a way that is so attractive to the consumers that they can charge some kind of delivery fee.

### How big do you really think the target market is for Ocado’s platform?

I don’t know the exact figures but I know that, in the supermarket business, a very small percentage of your sales are in baskets of £100 or more. That is the kind of basket that Ocado boasts that and, I understand, needs, to have their various KPIs working well for them. I have seen a few statistics from investors that have investigated that detail and they’ve got a big percentage of those consumers already. There is not a lot of ground still to go at. Once you start lowering the threshold of the basket size, so the business model starts to look less attractive.

### How do you look at Kroger’s relationship with Ocado? When they launched, I think they agreed to 20 big CFCs. One was in Florida, which was a new market for them. Do you think it works if you are a big grocer and you want to enter a new market, where you don’t have any stores?

It’s very attractive. I’ll tell you what Ocado is – as it was for Morrisons, when they tied up – it’s a fast fix option. These guys know how to do it; they know all the very latest technology. They’ve got a tried and trusted method, so away they go. You do the deal, you pay the money and the next day, you’ve got access to all of this operational technology. That is the offer that Ocado has.

When Kroger did the deal with Ocado, it was perfect timing for Kroger, because it really fast forwarded in a way that they could see what Walmart was doing and how much money Walmart was investing in that area of business. Of course, they could see what Amazon was doing. For them, it was a strategically intelligent move. Today, I think there are other options, particularly if you thought about it five years ago and you were working on launching something today.

I’m hugely respectful of Ocado’s business; they’ve done a brilliant job. So many other businesses tried it and just didn’t get anywhere because they ran out of money. These guys not only had the ability to deliver what they said they would do, but they were also very clever in how they got access to cash and they’ve spent a lot; they’ve spent a lot of money on the facilities and the assets that they have today.

I think one of the reasons that the story is so successful is that if you pour that amount in, it’s almost too big to fail, because so much cash has been swallowed up. I cannot see that, today, it is possible to repeat that with another business, in another land.

### Can we look at the meal kit providers, such as Hello Fresh and Goodfood, in Canada, where they supply a subscription service for meal kits and ready to eat meals that you cook at home? They are now shifting slowly online – some quicker than others – as a full grocery solution, with 3,000 to 4,000 SKUs, mainly private label. Goodfood is like an online Trader Joe’s. How do you look at a model like that? Pure play grocer, with a meal kit subscription business, plus then adding on grocery SKUs and being more like an online Trader Joe’s?

I think this business was very opportunistic. A brilliant idea, but small, in terms of scalability. You have got to be an incredibly organized person to be prepared to go through this whole meal kit idea. I don’t know if you’ve ever tried it; I tried it a few times and it’s novel and interesting, but it doesn’t fit into a busy lifestyle easily. Maybe it should, so that we are all eating slightly better ingredients and we know where they come from, but the world doesn’t seem completely ready for that, at scale, at this point.

The second issue is, it’s quite easy to copy. If it became a big deal, it’s not so difficult for any food retailer to say, we’ll do that. In fact, many food retailers are doing that. It is not easily defendable. It’s an obvious move, if you’ve got this business and there is some business in it – not profitability, but business, because none of them are profitable businesses – it makes sense to get on the bandwagon of either delivering somebody else’s groceries or delivering their own groceries, but not confining it to meal kits. It’s just part of the whole program of this boom in ecommerce grocery that Covid has brought about and fast forwarded it probably six or seven years, in six or seven months.

### If you’re running Goodfood, for example, and you want to roll out 3,000 to 4,000 private label SKUs, purely online, is this becoming a merchandising game? Finding the best products, at a good price and serving them online?

I honestly think that these guys are doing something in order to get an amount of business, to make their overall company either capable of borrowing more money, because it’s not particularly profitable, so you need access to funds to keep it going, or to make it saleable to somebody else. I don’t see this spawning the next Amazon or something revolutionary, which can become billions and billions of dollars and I can’t see the profitability in it.

### Final question, speaking of Amazon, what do you expect Amazon to do?

These guys are the kings of online; they are absolutely fantastic. They are big enough and profitable enough, from their general businesses and their mantra is fast fail. They will go into anything where they believe there is some potential value. They are prepared to enhance their non-food business, which is very profitable, with trying to find a way to get closer to the consumer, by selling them something that they consume every single day.

For them, I believe the attraction is just to know more about the consumer, in order to be able to capture as much business as they possibly can, in the future. They are supremely clever at seeing opportunities and taking advantage of them, whether it’s hairdressing in London or selling upmarket groceries in New York and all funded by the fact that their system of selling things is still the best system that I’ve seen.

### Whole Foods is a weird one because it doesn’t seem as if they have made much progress with Whole Foods, from my understanding?

Everything from Amazon is about information. With Whole Foods, what they get is a lot of information about what consumers buy, in terms of groceries. They are interested in consumers who are not so focused on cost, so it’s not the Aldi consumer that goes to Whole Foods. The Whole Foods consumer is somebody who is time challenged, but well educated enough to know that they want good quality products. For me, it was absolutely the ideal buy.

When I hear that there are rumors that Amazon could look at Morrisons, it doesn’t make any sense to me. Waitrose or M&S, I could see it; that is the kind of consumer they would be interested in understanding better, to see how they could serve those people with all their lifetime needs; not just food, but everything. I think that you will find that they buy other food businesses around the world, but it’s likely to be mid and upmarket type businesses, not mid or lower consumer types.
