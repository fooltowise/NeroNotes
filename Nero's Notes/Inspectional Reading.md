This is another name for "scanning" or "superficial reading". It means giving a piece of writing a quick  yet meaningful advance review in order to evaluate the merits of a deeper reading experience. Whereas the question that is asked at the first level ([[Elementary Reading]]) is "What does the sentence say?", the question typically asked at this level is "What is the book about?" 
There are two subtypes of inspectional reading.

First is systematic skimming, which is meant to be a quick check of the book by reading the preface, studying the table of contents, checking the index, and reading the inside jacket. This should give you sufficient knowledge to understand the chapters in the book that are pivotal to the author's argument. Dip in here and there, but never with more than a paragraph or two. Skimming helps you to reach to a decision point: **Does this book deserve more of my time and attention?** If not, put it down.

Second is superficial reading, when you just read. Don;t introspect over the argument, don't look things up, don't write in the margins. If you don't understand something, move on. What you gain from this quick read will help you go back and put more effort into reading.
