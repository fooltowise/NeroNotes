# Self-Deception
We don't just [[Cheating|deceive]] others; we also deceive ourselves. Our minds habitually distort or ignore critical information in ways that seem, on the face of it, counterproductive. 

On the one hand, our sense organs have evolved to fire us a marvelously detailed and accurate view of the outside world... exactly as we would expect if truth about the outside world helps us to navigate it more effectively. But once this information arrives in our brains it is often distorted and biased to our conscious minds. We deny the truth to ourselves. We project onto others traits that are in fact true of ourselves - and then attack them!  We repress painful memories, create completely false ones, rationalize immoral behavior, act repeatedly to boost positive self-opinion, and show a suite of ego-defense mechanisms.

It is important to note that there are many regions (modules) in the brains and that not all of them are self-delusional. It is possible for our brains to maintain a relatively accurate set of beliefs in systems tasked with *evaluating potential actions,* while keeping those accurate beliefs hidden from the systems (like consciousness) involved in *managing social impressions.*
