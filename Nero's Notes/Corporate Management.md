Good managers have the patience and discipline to invest in organic growth and the willpower to resist the temptation of a dash for growth through 'transformational' (and often value-destructive) acquisitions. Excessively proud management teams indulging in undisciplined acquisition sprees rarely create value for investors. Another sign for strong long term thinking is  a prudent balance sheet and counter-cyclical investment. Exceptional managers minimize borrowings and turn a recession into an advantage.

### Caution:
While good management can enhance results from quality companies, success or failure is not invariably a function of managerial action. Outstanding results do not reflect necessarily outstanding management. Business narratives tend to exaggerate the impact of leadership style and management practices.
