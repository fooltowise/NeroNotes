# Rationality
Rationality can be divided in two categories: *epistemic rationality* and *instrumental rationality*. 

- Epistemic rationality is the process of systematically improving its own beliefs so that the map they create reflect the territory of reality as accurately as possible. It is of course the foundation of science.
- Instrumental Rationality is the process of systematically taking the actions that make us closer to our values

The two categories often overlap, but not always. Let's take for instance the case of a politician promising to raise the minimum monthly wage to $2'000 *in order to improve the economy*. It would certainly not be epistemically rational: what the wage raise would achieve is keeping unqualified labor out of the workforce. But that would be a clear case of instrumental rationality, for the goal of the politician is to get elected and this move would certainly make him receive many votes.
