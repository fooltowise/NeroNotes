#  Tomas Billing on [[Röko]]’s genesis story

Fredrik and I had both been CEOs in our firms for around 15 years, and everything had gone well.

  

It is in such cases customary in Swedish business culture to ask one’s chairperson if it would be ok to take on an external board position in a well-renowned firm, such as Alfa Laval. But we preferred something more hands-on. So Fredrik and I asked for permission to invest in Hjertmans, a leading Swedish distributor of marine supplies, in 2015. So we had a history of working as owners and entrepreneurs together before founding [[Röko]].

  

We also had stress-tested each other in other situations. For example, during our first mountain hike, when we were around 25 years old, we found ourselves in a nasty snow storm, and we had to dig ourselves down and get help from the mountain rescue.

  

When I decided to resign from Nordstjernan in late 2018, I called Fredrik and told him that I thought we should do what we did with Hjertmans but on a larger scale. Fredrik replied: _“No, I have a great job and boss.”_

  

But I had decided to quit. And when I woke up one morning in February 2019, the news said: _“Fredrik Karlsson has been fired.”_ I thought to myself: _“What!?”_

  

**Gustaf:** I guess you had mixed feelings?

**Tomas:** Haha, yes. So I call Fredrik:

- “Hey Fredrik, how are things?”

- “Been better”

- “When the dust settles, consider my question from three months back”

  

And then Fredrik got back to me and said: _“Let’s do it.”_

  

[[Röko]] is around 70% [[Lifco]] and 30% Nordstjernan. The simplicity of [[Lifco]] is beautiful. They are frugal, and the subsidiaries appreciate the small overhead. The successful serial acquirers have all had small HQs. From Nordstjernan, we also bring a long-term mindset and efficiency, but more specifically, greater expertise in partnering with co-owners and B2C know-how.

  

**Gustaf:** _Who is the more competitive?_

**Tomas:** I have not been considered soft in other contexts, but I am the soft one in this relationship. Fredrik is even more direct than I am. I am competitive, but Fredrik is even more so. He competes at work, and then he goes home and competes in sail races in the evenings! He is always competing.

  

My son usually says: _“Poor Johan - imagine having you AND Fredrik as his bosses! It must be a nightmare.”_
