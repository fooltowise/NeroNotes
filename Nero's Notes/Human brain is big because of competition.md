# Human Brain is Big because of Competition

The most distinctive feature of the human species is our intelligence. Relative to our body size, we have unusually large brains. Why are we so smart and so flexible? And why did our brains grow so large and so quickly?


Two kind of challenges help to explain our brain's size:
- *Ecological challenges*, such as warding off predators, hunting big game, domesticating fire, finding new food sources, and adapting rapidly to new climates. These activities pit humans against their environment and are therefore *opportunities for [[cooperation]]*.
- *Social Challenges*, such as competition for mates, jockeying for social status, colation politics (alliances, betrayals, etc.), infra-group violence, cheating and deception. These activities pit humans against other humans and are therefore *competitive and potentially destructive.* 

Often a species' most important competitor is itself, and human species is no exception.

The earliest *Homo Sapiens* lived in small, tight-knit bands of 20 to 50 individuals. We had to compete not for sunlight, but for resources more befitting a primate: food, [[Competition for sex|sex]], territory, [[Competition in politics|alliances]] and [[Social status]]. And we had to earn these things, in part, by outwitting and outshining our rivals.

Robert Trivers argues that it was the arms race between lying and lie-detection that gave rise to our intelligence. 

>"Both the detection of deception and often its propagation have been major forces favoring the evolution of intelligence. It is perhaps ironic that dishonesty has often been the file against which intellectual tools for truth have been sharpened."
