### I’d like to get an idea how Lifco works, your interactions with Lifco, their culture and how they do business. Tell me about your own background first?

I’m a mechanical engineer from the beginning. I started off in a company called FLIR Systems. I think they’ve now changed their name to Teledyne, quite a large company. I worked within the ‘green’ products as they were called back when I was there; military equipment, sighting and surveillance cameras in infrared systems, so heat or thermal cameras as they’re called. I worked there for almost four years as a developer, mechanical designer and then moved on to a consulting business for another four years. The circle was a little closed when I came back to my first employer as a consultant and did a project during a seasonal lull. I went back to them and had a good time there but the circle was closed, then I saw that Ahlberg Cameras were looking for a project manager.

I had never heard about that company before but I understood they worked in the nuclear business and developed special cameras. I felt pretty confident designing cameras and would also feel confident managing others as well, so I got employment as a project manager but quite soon moved on to production manager because it wasn’t really project management they needed as I saw it. They needed a structure, a way to design and produce cameras for a growing market. We agreed that a production manager standardizing or modernizing cameras would be a better position for me. I did that for a couple of years and that grew into also affecting the design. I had the position of production manager and development manager at the same time for a couple of years but my heart was within development so I tended to slowly shift over to be more and more on the development side of things and pointed out a replacement for me on the production management side.

### What year did you join Ahlberg Cameras?

I joined them in ’09, maybe ’10.

### They were bought out by Lifco in 2012?

Yes, so quite early in my employment at Ahlberg. I wasn’t involved in anything regarding that transaction. But for me it was the same business; more or less the same tasks.

### When did you leave Ahlberg Cameras?

I left them 2½ years ago formally, but I ramped down a little bit earlier. I found that during my time at Ahlberg we developed quite a large product portfolio for a very small business and I wasn’t there to – there’s a Swedish word for it – upprätthålla, to maintain. I wanted to continue developing and Ahlberg wanted to finally start making profit on the investments they made, so it was a difference of what I and the company wanted. I think it was a good thing for both of us.

### You left to continue to do development work?

Yes.

### When Lifco took over in 2012, what changes were made?

The information we got was that Lifco is a company that have interest in other companies that already are quite good and make strong profit, so as long as we more or less did what we did before, we could continue without any interruptions or guidance from Lifco, but when it was needed, we had them to cover our backs, I would say. We were quite self-sufficient at least from my position. The CEO had a lot more interaction and helped with reporting and strategic decisions.

### Perhaps we should back up and try and get some more understanding about Ahlberg as a business itself first. How would you characterize that business? Were the customers government contractors, long term relationships? Did Ahlberg have a lot of competition? Could you talk about those aspects?

I think Ahlberg was founded back in the 80s so it was very much built on long term relationships and a solid reputation. They were highly respected within the business, so many customers, from the beginning, said that they would try to write their requirement specification for Ahlberg because they have so much history with cameras. They know what they have and they know what they want. The customers place repeated orders.

### Were these large ticket items?

The larger investments, they were mainly larger upgrades. Cameras and electronic equipment wears down quite easily and quickly in a nuclear environment, so selling spares is, of course, a big market for Ahlberg Cameras.

### What do these cameras do exactly? Is this a critical piece of equipment?

These are critical pieces of equipment. It is not functionally critical for the nuclear power plant. Most of the time you use the camera to inspect or monitor work onsite during an outage. Outages cost quite a lot of money because you’re standing still and not producing electricity, so anything you can do to shorten this time is very easy money. You can buy quite expensive equipment knowing that you will reduce outage time. That’s one big upside. Another thing is that the cameras need to be of a certain quality to know that when you’re inspecting that you make the right decisions, whether a surface-breaking crack is a crack and not just a scratch, so the image quality is important. Ahlberg Cameras have a good reputation of maintaining a high-quality image.

You also need robust cameras because they’re hanging from their own cables, banging against reactor walls. I would say that sturdy and robust cameras are what Ahlberg has a reputation for. The most difficult thing is making the equipment radiation tolerant because when you’re closing in to an object that is highly irradiating, you will get image disturbance. To be able to have a good, qualified inspection, you need to show that you don’t lose any image data during inspection or as you’re inspecting. You do calibration in-testing and calibration out-testing and you can’t have a system that is losing performance during operation. From my perspective, making the cameras radiation tolerant is the biggest thing that makes Ahlberg a good company.

### This business produced equipment that was very important in monitoring and preventing outages, and this was highly specialised and tended to wear out. How often do they have to be replaced or are there recurring purchases that customer at Ahlberg would have to make? Maybe you buy the camera but then afterwards you have to buy some kind of upgrades or replacement parts?

It’s a scale from a highly irradiating environment to almost none, but for some specific tasks you need to replace the core of the camera every time you use it. It’s quite big business, the aftermarket.

### How many companies did this kind of work? Is this an industry with a handful of players or something where Ahlberg was the go-to company for people to use? How did the industry look?

During my time, we said there were three large players worldwide, of which Ahlberg Cameras was one. On top of that, on each market there was only one or two locos. That was how the market was organized.

### How about the growth of this industry? Was it something that grew steadily year after year or was it lumpy and cyclical? How would you characterize the growth of this business?

I can only speak for my time there. I know there was quite steady growth. Some years were not as good as expected but we took that back the year after, so we were increasing quite steadily for these nine years.

### When you stay steady, what’s the ballpark number? Are we talking 5%, 10%, 15% growth, just broadly?

Three times turnover on nine years.

### That’s pretty good.

Very good. I don’t know how the last two or three years have been but I’ve heard that they’re still increasing. That’s impressive I would say.

Yes. You mentioned the business was founded in the 80s and built on long-term relationships and its reputation. Did that reputation continue after Lifco’s ownership and the relationships as well?

I don’t think too many have bothered understanding if Ahlberg was privately owned or owned by Lifco. They were buying Ahlberg Cameras and the functionality. They didn’t care too what much what we did. They explained their problems and we tried to solve them as a camera company and we got repeated orders based on history and a good reputation.

### Did the previous owners and managers stay after Lifco acquired Ahlberg?

The founder left; I don’t know if it was immediately or close after the acquisition but his son who at that time had spent 10 years in the company stayed. I know that he is trying to move away from the company as we speak. I don’t know how long he will stay there. The family stayed within the company during my time there.

### I know you said you weren’t involved with the transaction, but do you know why they sold?

I think Ulf Ahlberg, the founder of the company wanted to retire. Ulf managed the company as a family business and I think maybe it grew a little larger than he wanted. Of course, he probably made good money on it and could retire in good style. I’m guessing but I would be surprised if that wasn’t one of the reasons.

### Do you have any sense of why they chose Lifco? Were they maybe more than one potential bidder for the company or was it just something that was negotiated with Lifco?

If I continue guessing, from what I’ve learned about Lifco, we were quite self-sufficient and that was probably something that the former CEO and the new CEO liked about the deal, to continue their path but have a larger company covering their back and trying to continue growth.

### More financial firepower so to speak.

Yes. To be able to quote on these bigger projects.

### What you’re telling me is what I’ve heard others tell me as well, that was an important selling point for Lifco, that they buy the companies but then they let them continue to run and operate independently. When you were there did you have regular interaction with Lifco headquarters?

The CEO had weekly economic follow-ups. From the development side we had annual board meetings.

### The president of Brokk was the intermediary or manager between Ahlberg and Lifco?

Correct.

### Not the Lifco CEO, Fredrik Karlsson?

That’s correct. You have a good memory or you’re well informed! Fredrik Karlsson, yes. He was there a couple of times every year to understand where we are, where we were heading and we could get his point of view on strategic decisions and where we should try to focus on next year’s development. Not more than once, twice a year.

### They pretty much lived up to their promise not to interfere much, not even with pricing because sometimes I’ve heard they might intervene with pricing.

I think they gave our CEO the suggestion to increase prices on spare parts and consumables. Maybe they were right, I don’t know. They have this advisory take on it.

### Yes. It wasn’t like they commanded you to raise prices. It was more like this is what they advise you to do and you were free to take it?

Not according to what I understand. It was advising and reasoning.

### What was it like to work under Lifco? It sounds like it was fun and it went on as before, but in general, did people tend to stay?

We had very low turnover on people and I don’t think anyone ended their employment. We let a couple of contracted CFOs go. That was the position with the highest turnover. When it comes to production and development, very low churn. In terms of sales, they only increased their staffing during my time. The COO was quite sales focused. You could see how sales increased when he took an active part in selling, maybe because he’s a family name.

### What are some of the risks that you see, potentially, for that business in the future?

The risks I see is that the electronics industry, in general, is moving in the opposite direction when it comes to radiation tolerant systems. To be clear, modern electronics are more sensitive to radiation than older, analogue technologies, and when analogue electronics is getting more and more rare and the requirements within the nuclear business remain the same, we have a problem. That’s just physics. I don’t really see how anyone can overcome that. It’s the same for everyone. The market is still there but it’s maybe a positive thing, I don’t know. You can have more replacement cameras cores.

### What you’re saying is that the electronics are more sensitive to radiation?

Correct. Circuit boards, they’re higher density and it’s bad for radiation.

### I see. So the risk is that more and more of the newer electronics are less radiation tolerant and that’s something the Ahlbergs of the world have to figure out. You’re saying it’s just physics; how are you going to get around it?

I know that there are ongoing projects to make camera chips more resilient.

### Otherwise, it seems like a business that would be around a long time, as long as people are using nuclear.

Yes, and hopefully they will develop black and white cameras for the sole purpose of nuclear with a good enough image.

### Ahlberg changed their whole portfolio to drive growth. What’s the secret of the 3X turn in nine years?

That was an early step because they knew this was coming. They wanted to move into the US market. They opened a US office, so that was quite a big part of that increase I would say. It was also the way they crafted their cameras one at a time and treated every customer order as a project in the early 2000s. We shifted to standardized cameras to be able to put them on the shelf ready for dispatch quite urgently. It’s a little bit like that, if the customer has a need, it is quite urgent. Another thing is that for everything that was developed, we tried to have a dual purpose. So if we developed ambient lighting, we made sure it could fit in a larger system. That’s an example of what made it easy to design larger systems. You didn’t need to start from scratch. You had many components from their product portfolio and we could put together a system quite easily.

That was a benefit within Ahlberg. They also entered different market segments with surveillance cameras that are in the containment building 24/7, not only during outages, so quite a lot of sales in that market segment as well. I think up to the late 90s they worked locally here, mainly in Sweden and Finland and then they decided to expand in Asia and the US. They were very determined to succeed on those two markets.
