### **Bring me to your ideas…**

The thing is, the starting line is full of traps, obstacles, tricks & tomfoolery for those who aren’t prepared.

Let’s save you some of the heartaches on figuring out what your two little happy hands are going to be tappety-tapping about over the next days, weeks, months, years.

### **I want to start a newsletter, BUT ABOUT WHAT?**

The fame, the fortune, the newsletter subscribers. All tantalizing but alas, how do you make sure what you will write about is what the people want to hear?

First of all, we have a model to determine if your newsletter can go paid and become sustainable. Here’s our two cents:

Ask yourself if you have **the Three C’s:** Curious + Crowd + Cash. 

Simple rule of thumb: if you don’t have all three, don’t do it. That’s my advice. If you do have them, you might just have yourself a winner. And always feel free to tell me to f off and do it anyway. The fourth C should probably just be consistency, if you are consistent in content creation in just about anything over the long term you will win. So the first three are accelerators and the last C is the real differentiator. If you keep posting on social or on your newsletter consistently and with curiosity, just about everything changes. 

### **Curious**

1.  What am I curious about that I'd like to write about?    
2.  Remember to grow you need consistency (the fourth c) of posting at least weekly for a year. Ya better like the subject.    
3.  What do I already write about? Think about? Pay for things even though I make no money or impact from it?    
4.  Look at your cc statement, look at how you spend your weekends.    
5.  Finally, is anyone curious about YOUR opinions on the subject
    

### **Crowd**

1.  Where is another crowd of humans intrigued as well?    
2.  Are there subgroups who are equally as obsessed or curious about your topic?    
3.  A great way to check is Facebook groups. Are there groups full of 10’s or 100’s of thousands of people talking about knitting? Then you probably have a viable audience.    

### **Cash**

1.  Do you already spend money on this topic?    
2.  I like to look at if it’s something I spend at least $100 a year on? If so I can steal that $100 a year perhaps for my newsletter on the subject.    
3.  Then think about others; How can I help your subscribers make cash or have a group that is already spending on my topic?    
4.  If you get into business, finance, making money the profits can be infinitely higher. Why? There is an ROI on your newsletter.


### **SECRET HACK:**

Go to Facebook, google search Facebook groups in your niche. See how many people are in there. Look for the common questions and concerns they have. Then jump all over them. This is how you find out if what you want to talk about other people are interested in. If you can't find a Facebook group or a Reddit group on your subject, there is probably not enough interest. I'd compile a list like this for your niche.

When I started Contrarian Thinking I searched:

- critical thinking
- stoics
- contrarians
- passive income
- getting rich
- millionaires
- alternative assets

All the keywords I was going to focus on. I found an audience of millions. That confirmed my niche.

Lastly - think about who you want to do it with. 

As with anything in life, you are more likely to continue and succeed with a bud. That’s why accountability buddies work, why AA sponsors work, why investors like to see two founders.

**Take action:**

1.  Three C's: Write out what are yours. Write them out and flush them out later as you finish the course.
	   **Curious:** I am curious about quality investing in the stock market
	   **Crowd**: There are subreddits and forums about investing (see below)
	   **Cash** : People who want to invest have already spare cash. They often pay for tools like screeners or stock-picking newsletters or expert networks (I do). 

2.  Facebook Groups: Ok you think you know your niche, find the facebook groups that are relevant to your topics, see if there is interest inherent.
