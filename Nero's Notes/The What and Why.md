# The What and Why of your Newsletter

## The what

A newsletter is just a business and business is just a solution to a problem someone pays for. What is the problem you are solving?

This is the WHAT behind your newsletter. What is your topic? What will you write about? What will you stand for? What problems do you bring solutions to?

The key to audience virality, massive growth and monetization is a threefold tripod. 

Problem. Ease. Speed. 

**BIG PROBLEM SOLVED**

**EASE OF SOLVING**

**SPEED TO SOLVING**

You need to create a problem big enough to be worth people's attention and worth solving, help them solve with greater ease, and decrease the amount of time it takes to solve it. The bigger the problem, the easier you make solving it and the quicker you fix it, well the faster it all shakes out. 

Here's how I think about it: 

At Contrarian Thinking, our what is solving the problem that we humans just want to be free, and we aren't. Not free to live and work how, when and on what we want. We want passive income, we want to live life on our terms... we talk about how to fix that. And we try to do it fast and with a lil flair. Candidly we aren't optimized for the perfect "irresistible offer." We optimize for something else, things I'm curious about, ways to make money, think differently, and we focus on the way we say it. 

But how do you differentiate yourself in doing so? Easy. [**Your NAV.**](https://twitter.com/codie_sanchez/status/1420069013833625609?s=21)

Niche + action + voice

- **Niche down**
- **Help people take action every email**
- **Don't be boring: delight, piss off, or make them laugh.**




## The Why

Your why is the reason behind beginning to share your knowledge with people. Is it to grow your audience? Add another revenue stream? Extrinsically, maybe. But intrinsically, our why is to free minds and bank accounts through the power of contrarian thinking. Our readers, **YOU**, are our why.

### **It all starts with the idea.** 

-   [How to Start A Newsletter](https://idealustlife.com/7-reasons-why-you-should-start-a-newsletter/), and [again](https://www.kevanlee.com/articles/how-to-start-a-newsletter), and [again](https://www.forbes.com/sites/viviannunez/2020/03/27/4-things-to-keep-in-mind-if-youre-starting-a-newsletter/#f9626e43860f)... All I think you actually need is to answer these questions below. Spend an hour or two answering and writing them down. Then as we move through the rest of this course realize that by the end you need to have real answers. But don't worry too much you'll change them. I started in 2020 writing Contrarian Thinking about questioning everything and thinking critically, I ended up adding passive income and financial freedom as key cornerstones. The end doesn't have to match the beginning. 
    

**The TLDR? Ask yourself these questions to narrow your niche:**

1.  Am I excited about this project? (Read: Will I be hype to sit down and write an email on this topic on a regular basis? We suggest weekly.)
    
2.  If a friend was going to come to me for advice, would it be on this topic?
    
3.  What's going to set me and/or my business apart?
    
4.  Would people pay for this or will it be good lead generation for my business?
    
5.  What do I spend time reading, researching, and thinking about for free.99 anyway?
    
6.  What is my goal of the newsletter? My why? Money, fame, community?


The key here is going to be, remember this, repeat it often and SHARE THE STORY WITH YOUR PEOPLE. I like to film videos reminding people why we started Contrarian Thinking. Here's one example, below. Consider this your rallying cry to create your 1,000 true fans. Film one for your newsletter, write it on your desk, remind your crew (aka yourself) in the weekly meeting...



## Take action:

1.  **What is my why?** 
   
   My why is that people are so confused about the stock market. Quality information about stock market investing is very scarce, even more so on the French-speaking Internet. **I want to help people to build the skills to ask good questions when investing in the stock market so that they can build wealth over time.**

2. **The six questions**

1.  Am I excited about this project? (Read: Will I be hype to sit down and write an email on this topic on a regular basis? We suggest weekly.) I know that I will need to go at it for at least a year writing weekly emails.
    
2.  If a friend was going to come to me for advice, would it be on this topic? **Yes, definitely. People already come to me when they want to talk about finances.** 
    
3.  What's going to set me and/or my business apart? It's really hard to find good stock-market investing content on the French-speaking internet. 
    
4.  Would people pay for this or will it be good lead generation for my business? **Yes, I think this would be unique content people would be willing to pay for.**
    
5.  What do I spend time reading, researching, and thinking about for free.99 anyway? **I've spent the last six years of my free time reading about the stock market. You bet I am interested on the topic!**
    
6.  What is my goal of the newsletter? My why? Money, fame, community? 
	   - Money was definitely the trigger. I want to add another stream of income to my salary.
	   - I want to build an awesome community that will create optionality for me. If I really help people to understand how the stock market works, I will meet a lot of smart people who will build on top of what I am providing.
