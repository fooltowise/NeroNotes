# Munger's Critique of Academia

### Fatal Unconnectedness
There's a lot wrong with American Universities. I'd remove three-fourth of the faculty - everything but the hard sciences. But nobody's going to do that, so we'll have to live with the defects. It's amazing how wrong-headed the teaching is. There is fatal unconnectedness. You have these squirelly people in each department who don't see the big picture.

I think liberal arts faculties at major universities have views that are not very sound, at least on public policy issues. However, they may know a lot of French.

Whitehead spoke of the fatal unconnectedness of academic disciplines, wherein each professor didn't even know the models of the other disciplines, much less try to synthesize those disciplines with his own. I think there's a modern name for this approach that Whitehead didn't like, and that name is bonkers.
