## Growing early subscribers

 - Shared on Twitter that he had started a Newsletter
 - Guest post on another newsletter with same target audience
 - Started writing every week for three months
 - In parallel, working on a very deep post that took a hundred hours of work -> led to a jump of subscribers
 - 50% of early subscribers came directly from just two posts
 - Mix regular posts with epic posts
 - Continued to write for another three months
 - Word of mouth works: people talking to others about it, twitter, linkedin, facebook, Google SEO
 - **Create value for people, and they'll want to follow you!**
 - **Deliver consistent value to your audience!** Entertain them, or make them smarter.
	 - Make it actionable and concrete
	 - Talk about things I know - loop in experts when I don't
	 - Add something new to the conversation


### Recap:
1. Deliver value to people -> They'll share
2. Go to your audience is, e.g. guests posts
3. Leverage Twitter and "Influencers"
4. Mix regular posts with epic posts
5. Keep at it - it builds


## Launching a paid newsletter

### Why I decided to go paid
 - Now had confidence in my writing
 - Kept getting positive feedback
 - I was enjoying it
 - Income is good
 - Wanted to avoid real job

### Decide on your price
- Audience: Level of discretionary income
- Value: Painkiller or vitamin?
- Uniqueness: Can readers get this elsewhere?
- Validate: Find 3 readers who would pay
- Feel a bit uncomfortable: go higher
- if you can provide insights, you can charge higher

### Craft your pitch
1. Who are you again? Background
2. What's changing? Practical details
3. When is it changing? Timeline
4. Why subscribe? Value
5. Why subscribe now? FOMO
6. How do I subscribe? Call to action

See "This newsletter is growing up" post


### Seed with "influencers"
- Find your biggest champions
- Let them know about your plans
- Loop them in early
- Get their feedback
- Let them know before and after you go live

### Launch

- Set up the Stripe Account
- Flip the Substack paid switch on
- Send your email
- Announce it on your social medias
- Ping your "influencers"
- Keep expectations low


**Keep a timeline for a launch plan**

In first paid post, thank your paid subscribers.


About 50% of paid subscribers came in the first week : keep in mind how important the launch is.

Make sure your free posts are extra great. This is how you are going to grow once you go paid. Rule of thumb should be that epic posts should take 5 times more time to make than normal posts.

In about a year, Lenny made 50 posts since starting his newsletter. He went paid after 10 months (so only 6 posts were for paid members).

Recap:
- Make a plan - get the launch right
- Feel slightly uncomfortable about your price
- Make your free posts extra great
- Stay close to what you actually enjoy
- It's a grind - just keep cranking

## Things to consider before going paid

- Are you ready to write for 1+ years? Forever?
- Will you have enough high quality topics and content?
- What will your take-home income be after fees and taxes?
- How will you grow after your content is behind a paywall?
- Do you enjoy the work?
