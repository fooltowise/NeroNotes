Sometimes our tendency to conserve energy helps us, and sometimes it hurts us. 

While minimizing our output ensures we will have extra to draw on in times of increased need, it can also get in the way of learning. Experience doesn't become learning without reflection, and reflection is an energy expenditure. 

If we want to develop our thinking and get the most of our environments, then we have to be aware of the natural tendency of minimizing energy output and correct for it where doing so creates value.
