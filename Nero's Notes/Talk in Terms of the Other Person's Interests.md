# Talk in Terms of the Other Person's Interest

Figure out what are the interests of the person you are talking to, and talk to him/her about that.

Remember also good ol' Ben Franklin:
> If you wish to persuade, don't appeal to reason but to interest.

This way, you will both [[Give Honest and Sincere Appreciation| make this person feel important]] and [[Arouse an Eager Want]] in him/her.
