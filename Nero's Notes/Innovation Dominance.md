Companies with high gross margins have more to invest in tactics to defend and grow their business, in areas such as R&D, A&P or distribution. Such companies, able to invest more than their rivals, forge a virtuous cycle of growth: more spending drives revenues at high gross margins that spins off more investable resources. Spending on R&D - more specifically, on innovation - can be a particularly powerful part of this quality.
