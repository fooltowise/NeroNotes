# Get the Other Person Saying "Yes" Immediately

In talking with people, don't begin by discussing the things on which you differ. Begin by emphasizing - and keep on emphasizing - the things on which you agree. 

Keep emphasizing, if possible, that you are both striving for the same end and that **your only difference is one of method and not of purpose.**
