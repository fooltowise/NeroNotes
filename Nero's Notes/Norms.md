Unlike the rest of nature, humans can sometimes see ahead and coordinate to avoid unnecessary competition. This is one of our species' superpowers- that we are occaionaly able to turn wasteful [[Human brain is big because of competition|competition]] into productive [[cooperation]]. 

Norms are the rules or standards about how members of a community should behave. they range from loose, informal guidelines, like what to wear to a cocktail party, all the way to explicit, strictly enforced laws, like needing a license to drive on public roads.

Most norms - especially of the bottom-up, grassroots variety- are beneficial; they're one of the main ways we suppress competition and promote [[Cooperation]]. In other words, we hold ourselves back for our own good.
