# Circle of Control

> We control our reasoned choice and all acts that depend on that moral will. What's not under our control are the body and any of its parts, our possessions, parents, siblings, children or country - anything with which we might associate. Epictetus, _Discourses_



Again, there is only one thing I can control: my mind. Even my body can be taken away.
But that is good news because it drastically reduces the amount of things I need to think about. There is clarity in simplicity.
Only a single thing to manage: my choices, my will, my mind.
