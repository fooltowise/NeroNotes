# Recording Bogus Revenues


### Recording revenue from transactions that lack economic substance

- Be aware that with bogus revenue come those fake receivables
- Watch for barter transactions with related parties: be wary when seeing sales booked when no cash is paid (i.e barter transactions, "non monetary")
- Look for companies selling products to a distributor and later repurchasing from that same distributor unwanted, unused or overpriced products, initiating a round-trip cash payment

### Recording revenue from transactions that lack a reasonable arm's length process

- Transactions involving sales to an affiliated party:
  - Be wary of related-party customers, and joint-ventures partners. **Especially if the customer is a joint-venture partner**
  - Watch for transactions with parent companies. In some cases a large part of revenues come from sales to parent company
  - Be alert for suspicious revenue from transactions with joint venture partners (ex: considering the sale of an asset to a JV partner as a normal revenue)

### Recording revenue on receipts from non-revenue producing transactions

- Question revenue recorded when cash is received in lending transaction
- Pay attention to accounting for vendor rebates (be wary if cash is flowing from the vendor to the company in the context of a rebate. economic reality is unchanged, but the company will record the rebate as a revenue)

### Recording revenue from appropriate transactions, but at an inflated amount

- Watch for companies grossing up revenue to appear to be much larger: for instance if the company is a middle man recording a whole transaction as a revenue when in reality the real revenue is the fee on the transaction
