## Exemples
- [[Sherwin Williams]]

## Culture
There should be an extremely strong service-driven culture.
Cf. Sherwin Williams: "There are two types of employees at Sherwin Williams. There is people who sell paint, and there is people who help people to sell paint."


## Risk
The biggest risk for an influencer business model is that the influencer loses its credibility or his staying power. There is some level of disintermediation or disruption that happens. If there is an element of losing your trust, that is the biggest red flag.
