# Intangible Benefits

Intangible benefits arise when product decisions are made based on benefits that elude easy measurement. People have a favorite soda primarily because they enjoy the specific taste. Similarly, high-end  handbags are not bought for utility but because of the image they project (see [[Signaling]]). Factors like taste and image are hard to measure objectively, but offer considerable intangible consumer benefits. With purchases bases on intangible benefits, price is usually secondary.

**Intangible consumer benefits tend to be more prevalent in smaller items or those considered an indulgence.** Think of your decision-making when buying chocolates for your partner on Valentine's day. Price is probably not among the most important factors. If the ticket price is larger, tangible and rational benefits tend to play a bigger role. This explains why many people buy their favorite candy without checking price but might spend hours online researching the best deal for a car.

Intangible benefits often matter more to customers the more intimate the products are. Products that go in the mouth or on the skin carry more intangible potential than those that sit on a table or go into a machine, explaining why most people give the cost of their preferred toothpaste less thought than the price and brand of dishwasher detergent. This is one of the reasons why certain consumer products companies, from edibles to cosmetics, have proven to be such strong businesses over time.
