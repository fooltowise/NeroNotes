# Competitive Advantage


## Sources of Competitive advantage

There are two big categories of competitive advantage:
- Advantages that give you pricing power
- Advantages that allow you to be the [[Low-Cost Provider]]

### Pricing power: 
**We want the company to be a price maker, not a price taker.**

Most industries are deflationary over time. Try to seek an industry that is inflationary, not deflationary. 
Pricing power can come from:
1. A concentrated market structure: it is easier to negotiate with a lot of small customers than with a single strong one
2. The existence of an intangible asset, such as:
	1. [[Brands]]
	2. Long-term customer relationships (ex: [[Agency Business Model]])
	3.  [[Switching costs]]
	4.  [[Intellectual Property]]: MSCI, [[Games Workshop]]
	5.  [[Franchising]]
	6.  Provide a critical service or product whose cost is only a small part of the customer's total spending. Examples:
		1. [[Rightmove business model|Rightmove]]
		2. [[Analog semiconductor businesses]] like Linear Technology or Analog Devices.
	7. When the payer is not the decider
	8. The company is an [[Aggregation Theory|Aggregator]]
	9. [[Filtering]]: the company is removing uncertainty from the customer's life
	10. [[Luxury Business]]
	11. [[Network Effects]]
		Those intangible assets are by nature difficult to replicate, and tend to be more durable than hard tangible assets.
		
3. When the payer is not the decider (again example of the Agency business model)


### Be the [[Low-Cost Provider]]
1. [[Economies of Scale]]
2. [[Reverse pricing power]]
3. [[Scale Economics Shared]]



### Other Factors
1.  Is the company beneficiary of a [[Float]]?
2.  Look for the existence of a [[Flywheel]]
3.  [[Cults - the enabler of Reflexivity]]
4.  [[Multi-country operations]]
5.   [[Low-touch marketing]]
6.  A great [[Corporate Culture]]
7.  [[Distribution advantages]]


When a company does not enjoy any competitive advantage, the investor is heavily relying on management's [[Capital Allocation]] skills to provide acceptable returns.
