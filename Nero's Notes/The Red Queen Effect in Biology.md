# The Red Queen Effect in Biology

One day in 1973 Leigh Van Halen was searching his mind for a phrase to express a new discovery he had made while studying marine fossils. The discovery was that the probability that a family of animals will become extinct does not depend on how long that family has already existed. In other words, species do not get better at surviving, nor do they grow feeble with age, as humans do. Their chances of extinction are random.

The significance of this discovery had not escaped Van Halen, for it represented a vital truth about evolution that Darwin had not wholly appreciated. **The struggle for existence never gets easier.**

However well a species may adapt to its environment, it can never relax, because its competitors and its enemies are also adapting to their niches. Survival is a zero-sum game. Success only makes one species a more tempting target for another rival species. Van Halen's mind went back to his childhood and lit upon the living chess pieces that Alice encountered beyond the looking glass. The Red Queen is a formidable woman who runs like the wind but never seems to get anywhere:


> - Well, in our country, said Alice, still panting a little, you'd generally get to somewhere else - if you ran very fast for a long time, as we've been doing.
>  - A slow sort of country! said the Queen. Now here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!


A new evolutionary law, wrote Van Halen and sent a manuscript to each of the most prestigious scientific journals in turn - only to see it rejected. Yet his claim is justified. The Red Queen has become a great personage in the biological court. And nowhere has she won a greater reputation than in theories of sex.

Red Queen theories hold that the world is competitive to the death. It does keep changing. But did we not just hear that species are static for many generations and do not change? Yes. The point about the Red Queen is that she runs, but stays in the same place. The world keeps coming back to where it started; change there is, but not progress.

Sex, according to the Red Queen theory, has nothing to do with adapting to the inanimate world - becoming bigger, or better camouflaged, or more tolerant of cold, or better at flying - but is all about combating the enemy that fights back.

Biologists have persistently overestimated the importance of physical causes of premature death rather than biological ones. In virtually any account of evolution, drought, frost, wind, or starvation loom large as the enemies of life. The great struggle, we are told, is to adapt to these conditions. Marvels of physical adaptations - the camel's hump, the polar bear's fur, the rotifer's boil-resistant tun - are held to be among evolution's greatest achievements. The first ecological theories of sex were all directed at explaining this adaptability to the physical environment.

But it changes with the Red Queen theory. The things that kill animals or prevent them from reproducing are only rarely physical factors. Far more often they are other creatures - parasites, predators and competitors. A water flea that is starving in a crowded pond  is the victim not of food shortage but of competition. Predators and parasites probably cause most of the world's deaths, directly or indirectly.

When a tree falls in the forest, it has usually been weakened by a fungus. When a herring meets its end it is usually in the mouth of a bigger fish or a net.

What killed your ancestors two centuries or more ago? Smallpox, tuberculosis, influenza, pneumonia, plague, scarlet fever, diarrhea. Starvation or accidents may have weakened people, but infection killed them. A few of the wealthier ones died of old age, of cancer, or heart attacks, but not many.

The great war of 1914-1918 killed twenty five million people in four years. The influenza epidemic that followed it killed twenty-five million in four months. It was merely the latest in a series of devastating plagues to hit the human species after the dawn of civilization. Europe was laid waste by measles after AD 165m by smallpox after AD 251, by bubonic plague after 1348, by syphilis after 1492, by tuberculosis after 1800. And those are just the epidemics. 

Endemic diseases also carried away further vast numbers of people. Just as every plant is perpetually under attack from insects, so every animal is a seething mass of hungry bacteria waiting for an opening. There may be more bacteria than human cells in the object you call your body. There may be more bacteria in and on you as you read this than there are human beings in the whole world.

Parasites have a deadlier effect than predators for two reasons. One is that there more of them. Human beings have no predators except great sharks and each other, but they have lots of parasites. Even rabbits, which are eaten by stoats, weasels, foxes, buzzards, dogs and people, are host to far more fleas, lice, ticks, mosquitoes, tapeworms, and uncounted varieties of protozoa, bacteria, fungi and viruses. The myxomatosis virus has killed far more rabbits than foxes have. The second reason, which is the cause of the first, is that parasites are usually smaller than their hosts while predators are usually larger. This means that the parasites live shorter lives and pass through more generations in a given time than their hosts. The bacteria in your gut pass through six times as many generations during your lifetime as people have passed through since they were apes. As a consequence, they can multiply faster than their hosts and control or reduce the host population. The predator merely follows the abundance of its prey.

Parasites and their hosts are locked in a close evolutionary embrace. The more successful the parasite's attack (the more hosts it infects or the more resources it gets from each), the more the host's chances of survival will depend on whether he can invent a defense. The better the host defends, the more natural selection will promote the parasites that can overcome the defense. So the advantage will always be swinging from one to another: the more dire the emergency for one, the better it  will fight. This is truly the world of the Red Queen, where you never win, you only gain a temporary respite.

It is also the inconstant world of sex. parasites provide exactly the incentive to change genes every generation that sex seems to demand. The success of the genes that defended you so well in the last generation may be the nest of reasons to abandon these same gene combinations in the next. By the time the next generation comes over, the parasites will have surely evolved an answer  to the defense that worked best in the last generation.
