### Thomas, can you provide a short introduction to your role and responsibilities whilst you were at Spirax?

I worked with Spirax for about four and a half years. I started off as the regional manager for the Nordic area which comprises Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland. After approximately two years, I moved to the role of regional manager for Central and Eastern Europe. That covered Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Russia, from a sales and local management side. At that time, the local companies had responsibilities for sales and service as well as local manufacturing. It was a full P&L responsibility, within the region.

### How was that team structured between manufacturing and sales, across Europe?

The Nordic business does not have any manufacturing; it is strictly sales, servicing, support and warehouses. The German business has some production, which is mostly assembly type production, putting modules together and fulfilling projects. There is also some welding and other hardcore production. It is not on a huge scale but it serves the local market, in terms of these special projects.

Poland, Russia, Czechoslovakia and Switzerland do not have any manufacturing. Again, it is warehousing and a bit of testing and adjustment.

### Is there a sales office in those regions, as well?

Yes; sales, service and, again, it is set up as a profit center. Every local company is set up as a profit center and, essentially, is purchasing goods from the manufacturing sites, at a given price.

### Do they have a certain profit target, per year, that they have to meet, on average?

Yes; from a profitability perspective, in Europe, for many years, we were targeting 20%. I would say, most businesses in the Nordics and Eastern Europe were above 20% in terms of profitability. Germany was lacking a little bit but, in the end – and I think still – was above 20% EBIT margin. Of course, that target is moving and every year it has to be higher.

### How does Spirax balance the culture of high engineering and sales?

It is technical sales and consultative selling. In order to sell the Spirax products, there are some requirements that the sales person also has the technical knowledge and will be able to help the customer and explain to them the functionality and efficiency of the products. It does require an amount of engineering skills. This particularly applies when you want to sell larger projects as you need to go into a dialogue, with the customer, about requirements and how it can be set up in terms of Spirax solutions.

However, there is a second line of some real experts, some of them located in the center and others situated locally. They can support the sales people, in terms of specific areas. There is some engineering knowledge in the front line, the sales people, but also, to support some very specialized solutions, you have additional second line expertise.

### How does Spirax attract the best engineers to drive sales?

I think there is a lot of emphasis on recruiting. Traditionally, the field of steam has been a special branch of engineering and candidates who have knowledge within that area have always looked at Spirax as a good place to work, and I think it still is. As that branch of engineering is becoming diffused a little bit, Spirax has to put more emphasis on the HR and recruitment process.

### What do you mean by becoming diffused?

> People specialized in the steam area are becoming fewer and fewer and this is also true from the customer side. For a given customer, there used to be some experts in the steam system. Those people are now often retired. This is good for Spirax because that means the customer will have to go to Spirax to get their knowledge. In the past, a lot of customers had experts. You will also see Spirax recruited some of those experts, from time to time.

### Why are they dying out? Why are younger people not coming into the space?

From an engineering perspective, I think it’s seen as an older technology; which it is. It has been around for 100 years plus. Spirax is an old company and, for many years, has worked with the same type of products. It is not really cutting edge, in terms of technology. For younger engineers, this is not the natural branch of engineering to specialize in.

### Can we take an example of a large pharma or food key account? At that first stage, what is their decision-making process when purchasing? For example, why even choose steam in the first place, versus the alternatives?

I think there is one key answer as to why they choose steam in the first place, which will apply to 95% of all sales. That is, you already have steam. You want to expand a set up that you already have.

### Why do they have steam?

In many cases, it was the most efficient choice. If you go for either a water-based or steam-based heating system, the steam-based would be the most efficient, typically. Because of the properties of steam, you can store a lot of energy in that phase change between boiling water and steam. When you condensate, you release that heat. In terms of heat distribution, it is an effective medium.

Looking at it from a greenfield perspective, it will be a very competitive technology. But I think, a lot of customers will probably also go with some electrical solutions.

### Can you just explain how a customer would then compare that heat transfer with other things that could, potentially, replace steam in the future?

For many customers, considering the green agenda, they will look to build plans which are based on renewable energy. In principle, it is possible with steam but a lot of the steam systems today are based on fossil fuels; gas and even oil. If you look inside the boiler house, most of it is fossil fuel based. Also, there is some complexity in handling steam in a distributed system. People will, naturally, start to look at what kind of electricity-based solutions they can find, for heating. I don’t know how advanced they are, at the moment but I know there are some options out there.

### As customers switch from gas or oil to electric at the source of energy, how does that impact steam and its effectiveness?

I think I very much consider the steam systems, already installed at customers, as some kind of infrastructure, that the customer does not really want to replace. They would probably look to optimize that set up, to save energy, but I think they would also look at the boiler house to look at how the steam was generated. Can it be done electrically, or can it be done with renewable energy sources? I think a lot of the existing steam customers would go down that route.

### They wouldn’t replace the steam system?

Yes; they would look at the fossil fuels in the steam generation. However, for a total greenfield customer – and I’m not an expert in the technologies and where they are right now – as a business manager, I would consider whether there was an alternative that is based entirely on electricity.

### That could miss out Spirax completely?

In terms of winning new customers, I think the technology would be compared. But in terms of retaining old customers, and also expanding their business with existing customers, I don’t think there is a real threat. Unless, of course, something new and very unexpected pops up.

### Spirax talk about Chromalox and their ETS segment, which is supposedly linked to the steam and this decarbonization trend. How do you see that, potentially, combatting that risk of customers moving away from steam and Spirax keeping that business, with Chromalox?

I think it’s a nice idea and I can see the logic. During the period I was working at Spirax, there was no cross-selling or any kind of sales synergy from Chromalox into the business. There was very little cross-training of sales people. At least when I was working there, up until two years ago, they were kept as very separate businesses. If there is a possible future synergy, it is something that has not yet been harvested.

### How could that acquisition help them in this decarbonization trend, if there were synergies?

I know Chromalox’s technology is based on electricity. Of course, if that technology is implemented in some areas of the steam business, that could drive some more green solutions.

### Did you see it being harder to win new customers during your time there, because of the business manager questioning as to whether there was a more effective way to build a new greenfield plant?

First of all, in the markets I served, we had relatively few greenfield customers. I don’t see steam as a very expanding market. It is a market which sits with current customers and, maybe, in some geographies – such as India – you will see some kind of market expansion.

With the very few greenfield sites, there was always the consideration as to whether there could be some electrical solution, which would be easier to maintain and which does not require the very specialized knowledge necessary for steam. From a technology perspective, it is a future competitor.

### How can Spirax navigate that challenge?

> The first point to remember is that Spirax doesn’t make the boiler. The steam generation is, currently, a very limited part of Spirax’s business. However, what Spirax does is distribute the heat energy. From a pure distribution perspective, steam is an efficient method. In order to win these kind of greenfield opportunities and also, in the long run, convince existing customers to expand their steam system, rather than go for something completely new, I think Spirax need to be more involved in how the steam is generated in a renewable way. They would need to do some kind of partnerships.

### How do you look at the different parts of the system? There is a diagram in Spirax’s investor notes where they do have steam generation, distribution, utilization and then a packaged solution for energy recovery. Are these just products around the boiler itself, at the steam generation level, that Spirax offer and sell and they also offer parts of the distribution?

As far as I know, Spirax don’t have a real boiler house offering. They do offer controls for both monitoring and controlling the boilers. But the boiler itself – the burner and steam generation – as I understand it, is currently outside of Spirax’s focus.

### Where are they unique in that whole process?

> Spirax is the leader from where the steam is generated until it is used, somewhere in the production line of the customer; making sure that the steam energy is distributed in an effective way. In order to do that, you need efficient steam traps and you also need to reuse the energy. There are all those kind of things where Spirax can make an argument that their expertise helps the customer improve energy efficiency.

You can waste a lot of energy in a distribution system, if you don’t have the steam system under control.

### Going back to revenue growth and driving growth at Spirax, what were you really focused on, as a general manager?

We were looking at three different revenue drivers. One is the bigger projects, more than €100,000.

### Is that greenfield or just big projects?

Very few of those would be greenfield; most would be existing customers expanding their plant or making a new production line. Then you have small to medium-sized, which could be €10,000 to €50,000. Then you have everything below €10,000, which is MRO so would pay us for maintenance.

If you look at those three drivers, you would have some different strategies for how you would grow them. The MRO is, obviously, nursing your existing customers and making sure they have access to your competence and insight. You also visit them, from time to time, look at their plans and point out some areas in the steam system where they could make some small improvements.

For the medium-sized projects, it would be entirely the sales people who would do the proactive visits. They would walk through the steam systems with the customers and maybe come back with a report and some suggestions. Some of those suggestions could turn into, let's say, an RFQ and Spirax would make an offer, based on that.

Larger projects would, very typically, go through a contractor, a building company or building consultant, and that would be, very much, a tender type.

### How do Spirax approach those larger projects?

They would try to influence the RFQs and tender specifications. You would try to keep some kind of relationship with the consultants and contractors. In that way, you would help them to make the tender specs or give them some input on the specs. The earlier you can start that dialogue, the better the likelihood that you actually win the tender, in the end.

### What does the customer really care about, in those tenders?

They want a safe and effective system. Of course, they also care about price. For the big tenders, this is a big driver.

### How competitive are these tenders, for the larger projects?

Through their name, reputation and the whole consultancy aspect of the business, Spirax are in a good position in many of those tenders. In a tender, you look at the price but you also look at the track record and quality of the supplier. This is where Spirax has an advantage.

### I’m just looking at the diagram they have of the whole steam system, from steam generation, to distribution, to energy recovery. There are 100 products, like valves, pumps and tubes. If I’m the customer and I’ve got this system, my production plant is probably 50 years old, how do I even approach solving a certain part of this? Are there many different suppliers that could bid for these types of large projects? Can you give me a bit of an understanding of the competitive dynamics of different parts of this system?

If you want to set up an entirely new system, including heat exchangers, the whole distribution system, the boiler house and all of those things, there would not be one supplier you could go to. You would have to make the full spec and then you would have to procure from different suppliers. Spirax has, pretty much, an end-to-end product range, from the boiler, where the steam is generated up until the heat exchanger. In the heat exchange area, where you actually apply the heat, Spirax have also got a nice product range but there are bigger competitors in that area who have a broader product range and better penetration of the market.

### Where is Spirax strongest?

Definitely in the distribution of the steam. In terms of steam traps, we are using waste energy in the system’s control valves, to distribute the steam.

### Are the traps mainly Gestra?

No; the majority of the steam traps are [[Spirax Sarco]]; both Spirax and the old Sarco. This is old core business. But Gestra has traps as well, and a good market here in Germany.

### If I’m a customer and I’m looking to replace my heat exchanger at the end of the process, that tender process is completely different competitive dynamics compared to the distribution part, where there might be some bigger heat exchange businesses that are competing and have a better solution than Spirax?

Yes, I think so. From the heat exchange perspective, you have big companies, like Alfa Laval and Tetra Pak which can make, not only the heat exchanger, but can also make the whole application for the customer. If it’s a dairy manufacturer, for example, the whole spray drying, to make the milk powder, that is something that Tetra Pak can do. They will then integrate the heat exchangers into the solution.

It’s a challenging market and, I think, in the end, Spirax has a very small market share in that end of the system.

### If there is no steam expert at the customer – or fewer, going forward – who is consulting on that purchase, what is the process in consulting on sales?

> Often, if the customer buys a new production line, which is 70% Tetra Pak or GEA, then that would be a nice point of contact. But often, over time, they would find out that, for the whole steam distribution side, Spirax will have the better knowledge and will be able to help in a better way. Even though, perhaps, the sale has gone through Tetra Pak, Spirax will still follow up with the customer to make sure that the whole steam distribution system works well.

### When you look at Spirax’s margins, revenue growth and cash generation, why are they so much more profitable than someone like Alfa Laval or GEA?

One thing is, I think GEA and Tetra Pak are much more exposed to the tenders, whereas Spirax benefits from working in this small project scale and in the maintenance repair scale. In a lot of the mature markets, some 40% of the business is maintenance and repairs. There, you can get the really strong margins.

For the big projects, you don’t get the strong margins and this is what Tetra Pak and GEA are exposed to. It’s also where you take the big risks because not all projects end up going exactly to plan and, often, there are some penalties involved and there could be some implementation difficulties.

### These are the large projects, end of the line heat exchangers, with new technologies, that need to be implemented on the new production line, that obviously adds more risk to Alfa Laval and is more competitive, because they are all competing against each other, because they are larger deals?

Yes. It’s tender based so competition is very much head-to-head and it’s very difficult to retain a good margin.

### Isn’t Spirax’s products tendered in the distribution layer of the same system?

In a few cases, yes. You could have cases where a big customer wants to replace 500 steam traps. They would definitely make a tender for that. Often, the projects are €10,000 to €15,000 and they would maybe get a second quote. But in the end, they would probably make an argument, internally, in the organization, to go to Spirax.

### Why?

Because of the knowledge; because the old traps and the rest of the system is Spirax; because they have good relations and trust with the sales and service people of Spirax.

### How do Spirax stay top of mind for the customer, as a company?

This is sometimes the challenge. On a management level, a lot of customers underestimate the steam system. They look, very much, at the application side. This is one of the challenges for the sales people, to not only have good relations with the maintenance people in the organization, but also be able to approach their managers. Of course, they are using agendas such as energy efficiency, to get a little bit higher up in the hierarchy.

### If I’m a customer, and I have a big dairy production line, and I have an agenda to improve my energy efficiency, from my boss, when I’m looking to make an improvement in the distribution of steam or throughout my process, why do I turn to Spirax?

> If you don’t have a lot of knowledge about the steam system and are uncertain as to what is going on in the steam system, you wouldn’t mind paying a bit more to get products from the person that you think is very competent and absolutely knows how to deal with it. It’s not an area where you can save a lot of money by going to another supplier. Maybe percentage wise, but in terms of the overall production budget, it’s not a huge amount. You go for the safe bet.

### Reputation and the existing traps?

Yes, and knowledge. Spirax has the knowledge which, I think, if you look overall, that is becoming more and more valuable because specialists, among the customers, are retiring.

### Who is Spirax’s biggest competitor?

On the distribution side, with traps and those kind of things, I think, TLV and maybe Armstrong in the US. For the heat exchangers, it’s definitely Alfa Laval.

### Take Armstrong, for example. Don’t they have the experience, the knowledge and the reputation that the customer will go to them if they want to do a small upgrade?

In the US, I think they have a strong organization; they have experts who are accessible. In Europe, they have a smaller installed base and small organizations so it is definitely not the same reputation as Spirax. In the US, I think they are a real alternative.

### How could Spirax win market share from Armstrong, for example, in the US, if they have the knowledge, reputation and a service force, on the ground?

That’s a good question and one of the priorities and potential growth drivers for Spirax is to increase market share in the US. I think the formula is the same as it has been in a lot of other places. You need competent people; you need them to be proactive in working with the customers. Go to the customer sites; do walks with the customer and explain where there could be some improvements and what the business case could be to make those kind of improvements. This is the hard work involved, but it does require people close to the customers.

Building up the American organization has also been a priority. Maybe the acquisition of Chromalox has contributed to the reputation in the US because Chromalox are US based.

### What is the biggest competitive risk to Spirax in Europe?

> From an overall perspective, I would say Samsung, who are experts in the control valves. In the steam distribution system, you have all the pipework, the steam traps and strainers to release the condensate. But you also have the control valves, to make sure you direct the steam in the right direction and they also control the pressure. Samsung is a serious competitor in that area.

### Could they move into traps?

I think they have some traps.

### How would the customer look at Samsung versus Spirax, in control and traps?

During my time, it was not a real competitor in traps, simply because of knowledge and Spirax’s installed base.

### What about in control valves?

In control valves, they have very strong business. In a lot of these steam distribution systems, you would go to the control valve, look at it and you would find the name Samsung. You call Samsung and you start the first dialogue with them. Also, Samsung has been good in setting up partnerships with the big contractors, such as Tetra Pak and GEA, to make sure that their control valves are part of their overall system.

### How could that impact Spirax’s position in the system, if Samsung do continue to gain market share in the control valves?

It is a bit of a split, in terms of competence. Spirax has a very strong position and installed base and a lot of competence in the traps and those kind of elements, where Samsung has all that in the control valves. Of course, Samsung would see the trap side as a potential growth area and an opportunity to win market share. Likewise, Spirax is considering the control valves as a possible area to win market share. It is a dynamic balance.

### When we look at Spirax’s revenue growth, most industrial businesses – such as Alfa Laval – are highly cyclical. Spirax is an almost perfectly linear upwards trajectory, for the last 20 years. Why is that?

In the down periods, with very low industrial growth, the big projects are not there. But often, the customers have to keep the existing systems going, so the maintenance and repair business goes up. In some of the small downturns I experienced, we definitely saw MRO business go up when the project business went down, and vice versa. That is one aspect that keeps some balance.

Another aspect is that Spirax has been very good at keeping their prices growing at a rate higher than inflation.

### How do they approach pricing?

Very professionally, based on a lot of analytics, in terms of the whole cost side and competitive pricing, but also, from a customer perspective and the value perspective. They are looking at where they can increase prices and where do they not increase prices, in order to optimize business.

### Is there a minimum price increase you would have to push through every year, at Spirax?

Oh, yes. This is one of the KPIs that were monitored. There are probably a handful of very critical KPIs for the local companies.

### What are they?

It’s the usual ones; profitability, profit margin, the revenue order intake. It’s also the implemented price increase. Then you would have aspects like health and safety, as well.

### You mentioned 20% EBIT margin, roughly, as a target. What would it be for the prices? Would it be roughly 5% that you would have to push through every year, minimum? Or even higher?

It depends, a bit, on inflation. Let’s say, if inflation is 2%, you would maybe want to go for 3.5% or 4% price increase.

### What about now, when inflation is 8%?

I have been thinking about that. It will probably be inflation rate, plus something.

### What does the customer say when they push through inflation plus 5%, or double inflation?

> Some don’t notice because it’s so small; it’s repairs and maintenance. Where it is noticed is with the very big OEM customers who, typically, purchase for a lot of money, every year. They monitor the price increases and, every year, there would be a negotiation. Let’s say for Tetra Pak, you would definitely not get the same price increase as you would get from other customers.

### I think 15% to 20% of the revenue is sold to OEMs, roughly?

It depends on the geographic market but, yes, in that range.

### If I’m Nestlé, for example, and I’ve got my production plant and there is a downturn, I’m not going to be opening another new production, but I might be tweaking my old one to maximize efficiencies. If I go to Spirax for a $10K to $20K repair, how do I look at the invoice? Do I even know the cost of that and the right price?

If you are Nestlé, then you would probably monitor your suppliers and look at the unit prices. You would maybe have a professional purchaser who would definitely question some of the prices. It might be that you don’t have a real alternative and Spirax is able to make a good argument as to why prices are going up, such as raw material prices or labor costs. There are typically some good explanations that, as a sales person, you can have in your back pocket and bring forward. If you take the Nestlé example, they are definitely harder to work with than the local cheese manufacturer.

### Would Nestlé actually question you on a 10K or 15K invoice?

I think they would because, over a year, maybe they get 10 or 15 invoices like that. They are good at coordinating across sites and comparing prices. A lot of B2B companies are up against the fact that the purchasing organizations are becoming more and more professional.

### How do you think Spirax will perform over the next 18 months, two years, when inflation is this high?

I think they will do well. I think they will be able to come up with some strong arguments for how their prices should increase, with inflation, or maybe a little bit above.

### How did you see customers react to the start of Covid, in those early days, as you were leaving?

What sometimes causes a stop in the business is the uncertainty, which was definitely hitting all markets with Covid. We could see it coming in China first. That first month, where Covid was only in China, we could definitely see the business being reduced. As with other businesses, once you have come across that first period of uncertainty, you then realize you need to keep the business going. Then you start to go back to more normal purchasing patterns.

### Were they still doing the MRO and small projects, even during those times of uncertainty?

Yes, because who are Spirax’s customers? It is the food business and the pharmaceutical business.

### But it still declined 4% in 2020, for the whole group?

Yes, but if you have a month of massive uncertainty in the markets, where even some customers are closing down manufacturing, then it is hard to recover in the other months. I don’t think 4% is much in the overall perspective and I think they were growing more than 4% the year after.

### How do you look at future revenue growth? Management say that the industrial production is a key driver. Let’s say they can pass through prices; is it industrial production plus inflation that is the minimum organic growth that you should expect?

Yes, that has been the argument for a long time. I even think that some people have, over a period, been correlating our business with the industrial growth. From year to year, I think it has not been a one to one but, over time, maybe there is some correlation.

### It’s less about winning new market share. As you said, there are very few greenfield plants and, if there are, then maybe electric or different solutions are taking more market share. It’s really just the maintenance of the installed base that is driving it?

Yes, and maybe Spirax can come up with a way to tackle renewable.

### With Chromalox?

Yes; maybe electricity-based boiler rooms. I’m sure they will; they’re not going to lean back.

### What makes Spirax so good at this consultative selling?

The knowledge about steam which is decreasing. If you are an expert in something and other people know very little about it, then you have a strong consultative skill. I think that is what is going on with Spirax.

### Does that come from Nick, at the top, or is it more ingrained in the organization? Could that be a risk if Nick leaves, for example?

No; I think the whole idea of consultative selling is at the very core of Spirax. Have a local presence, with the customer; help and guide the customer. This is part of the culture. I think what Nick has contributed is definitely the drive towards profitability, efficiency in the organization and margin improvement through price increases.

### How did he change the strategy of Spirax, during his time?

It was definitely about putting more emphasis on the customer segment, in the dairy and pharmaceutical business. Becoming more aware of the requirements and applications that we have to address with the steam systems. That is some new competence that the organization had to build up; knowledge about the specific industries. That has also helped fuel better dialogue for the customers.

### Management do say that 50% of revenue is from the MRO type transactions; under €1,500. What type of repair is this?

It could be that a customer sees that a steam trap is leaking, in his production line. There is a piece that is leaking; who is the supplier? He sees Spirax on the label and calls Spirax for a new steam trap. They will have it the next day. Maybe you call Spirax and they will say, certainly we can get you a new steam trap; is there anything else we can help you with?

### What do you think is the biggest risk with the recurring revenue nature of Spirax? What could cause that to decline, over time, or put the business at risk, potentially?

I think they are in a good place. It is hard to come up with a major thing that could break the current pattern. Competition is very fragmented and doesn’t have the same reputation and insight as Spirax has. Steam is a niche area so there are not many new people coming into that area. Spirax keeps improving, as an organization.

### Does Spirax retain their sales engineers enough?

I don’t have the latest numbers for that but, when I was there, we were fairly good at it, if I were to compare Spirax to other organizations.

### Do the guys on the ground get paid well enough?

That probably varies from market to market.

### It’s a highly technical sale; I guess it’s the most important part.

And as I said, the knowledge is becoming more and more valuable to the customers who have big steam infrastructures.

### Let’s say it’s 2030, eight years ahead, and Spirax has not grown revenue, at all. What do you think could be the reason why?

There could be two things. Firstly, that some new electricity-based technology has succeeded and penetrated some of the existing Spirax customers. Secondly, another risk could be the fact that Spirax has pushed the price increases, and their overall price level, too far so, at some point, customers say, I know they are the best, but maybe I should look at some alternative. We usually set around 20%, for a lot of the key items.
