# When what is most effective makes no sense

In a world where logics, engineering and technology drives progress, it is likely that the remaining big issues we are facing cannot be easily solved with logics. Otherwise they would have likely been already solved.

When some problems are logics-proof, it can happen that a totally irrational approach is much more effective at tackling the issue.

In the business world, many of the greatest successes are based on premises that don't make sense at all:

- "What people want is a really cool vacuum cleaner (Dyson)"
-  "And the best part of all this is that people will write the entire thing for free! (Wikipedia)"
-   "And so I confidently predict that the great enduring fashion of the next century will be a coarse, uncomfortable fabric which fades unpleasantly and which takes ages to dry. To date, it has been largely popular with indigent laborers. (Jeans)"
-    "And people will be forced to choose between 3 or 4 items (McDonald's)"
-    "And best of all, the drink has a taste which consumer say they hate (RedBull)"
-    "And just watch as perfectly sane people pay $5 for a drink they can make at home for a few pence. (Starbucks)"
