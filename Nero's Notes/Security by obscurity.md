# Security by Obscurity

In business, as in nature, the ability to keep out of sight of potential predators is an advantage. While lenses, locks, ostomy products and bathroom fittings all play an important role in everyday life, they occupy humble corporate niches. These sectors are relatively small, are not experiencing hyper-growth and do not offer obvious opportunities for technological revolutions. This relative obscurity can offer a layer of protection from competitive disruption.

Financial and intellectual capital is drawn towards ideas that can change the world and which have the potential to make big money fast. Consequently fields such as renewable energy, robotics, electric vehicles and disease prevention garner disproportionate focus. You are less likely to see vast amounts of capital allocated to improving ostomy bags or gaining shares in the toilet fittings market. While operating in a [[Niches| niche sector]] does not, in itself, make a company great, it can help. An obscure industry, even one with compelling economic characteristics, tend to face lower disruption risk, making industry structures more durable.
