The rise of quantum mechanics in the first quarter of the 20th century helped to explain the behavior of matter at very tiny scales.
The consequences of quantum mechanics are immense:
- The Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle states that you cannot know at the same time the position of a particle and its momentum with infinite precision: the limit of the precision is defined by 
$$ \Delta x \Delta p \geq  \frac {\hbar}{2}  $$
-  The probability P of an event in an ideal experiment is given by the square of the absolute value of a complex number $\phi$  which is called the probability amplitude
      $$ P = \mid{\phi}\mid ^2  $$
       
-  When an event can occur in several alternative ways, the probability amplitude for the event is the sum of the probability amplitude for each separate way considered separately. There is interference.
$$ P = \mid  \phi _1   + \phi_2  \mid ^2$$
-  When an experiment is performed which is capable of determining whether one or another alternative way was actually taken, the probability of the event is the sum of the probability for each alternative. The interference is lost.  
$$ P = P_1 + P_2 $$

Quantum physics thus acknowledge that it is impossible to know for sure what will happen. All it can do is compute odds that a certain outcome will happen. Physics has given up on the problem of trying to figure out what will actually happen in a given circumstance. The only thing that can be predicted is the probability of different events.
