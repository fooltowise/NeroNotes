# [[Robert Vinall]]'s owner manual


Dear Investor,

Thank you for your interest in the Business Owner fund. Business Owner is a long-only equity fund. It is invested according to the value investing principals of Warren Buffett. It invests in great businesses run by honest and able managers when they are available at a reasonable price. The fund can invest worldwide in all asset classes. In practice, a large number of the investments are German equities. This may change over time.

I started the fund four years ago and am the sole owner. There is no sponsor. There is no pressure to raise assets. The sole focus is on generating the best possible performance over a long period of time. My ambition is to belong to that minority of investors who have sustainably beaten the market. Very few fund managers beat the market. Even fewer beat it by a significant margin. You are probably asking why my fund is different. Ultimately, only time will tell. However, I believe that the Business Owner fund has a number of advantages that benefit you, the investor:

• Nearly all of my own wealth is in the fund. My investors and I are all in the same boat  when they lose money, I lose money.
• The fund is focused on my best investment ideas. It contains just 10 publicly listed companies. The largest position accounts for one quarter of net asset value.
• I manage the fund for the long term. Turnover has been less than 10% each year since inception, implying an average holding period of over 10 years. Having a long investment horizon allows me to buy companies when they are out of favour. This is the only time when great companies can be bought cheaply.
• The fund has a very loyal investor base. There has not been a single meaningful redemption since I started 4 years ago. Having long term, patient investors helps me to focus on the long term. The majority of fund managers do not have this luxury. They are measured on quarterly or even monthly results.
• Low turnover also means that transaction fees are kept to a minimum. They are a huge drag on many funds, especially where the parent company owns a brokerage operation.
• Due to the combination of low turnover and high concentration, I can spend more time than most managers researching ideas before investing and monitoring them thereafter. Diligent, ongoing research helps to minimize risk though of course it is never fully eliminated.
• I am free from the institutional pressures that bog down many fund managers working in large organizations. The truly great investment opportunity calls for swimming against the tide. I am not afraid to be contrarian. A fund manager trying to manage his career risk may take a different view.

In the interests of saving your time and mine, I would also like to point out some aspects of how I invest which lead some investors to rule out an investment:

• I am a one-man show. I have organized myself this way as it frees me to focus all my energy on capital allocation rather than managing staff. The low cost nature of my set-up means I can pass on the cost savings to my investors and am not under pressure to raise assets. Rest assured though: should I ever be run over by a bus, the Investmentaktiengesellschaft für langfristige Investoren (the asset manager) will ensure all redemption requests are met.
• The Business Owner fund is not diversified. I am a believer in the Mark Twain’s dictum: “Put all your eggs in one basket, and watch that basket!” Most business schools teach that diversification is the highest goal. If that is your view, Business Owner is not for you.
• The fund has an unusual legal structure called a Teilgesellschaftsvermögen. It is similar to a Luxemburg SICAV, but is domiciled in Germany. Its benefits include robust ownership rights, regulation through the BAFIN and full tax transparency. I like the structure as it allows me to invest in a concentrated way. Some investors prefer a more familiar structure.
• I do not have any secret formula to beat the market. What I do is very simple. I buy great businesses run by honest managers when they are cheap. If you are looking for a financial wizard with a black box, I am afraid the search will have to continue.
• The track record is just 4 years old. There is plenty of evidence that managers achieve their best performance early in their careers, but some investors prefer managers who have been in business for 10 years or longer. If this is you, I will contact you in 6 years time.
• The fund has quarterly liquidity. I often hear that investors would prefer monthly or even daily liquidity. If three months is too long a time horizon, you are not who I am looking for.
• There is one share class and one price for everyone. I do not pay commissions to middlemen.
• Assets under management are EUR 50 m. Some investors prefer larger funds. This is not what I have to offer. I prefer a smaller asset base as it is easier to deploy capital profitably. I will close the fund to new investors before size hinders performance.
