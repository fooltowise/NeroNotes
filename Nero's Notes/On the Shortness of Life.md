# On the Shortness of Life

#stoicism 
## by Seneca
- It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it.
- Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested.
- Why do we complain about nature? Life is long if we know how to use it. 
- Men do not let anyone seize their estates, and if there is the slightest dispute about their boundaries they rush to stones and arms; but they allow others to encroach on their lives - why, they themselves even invite in those who will take over their lives.
- People are frugal in guarding their personal property; but as soon as it comes to squandering time they are most wasteful of the one thing in which it is right to be stingy.
- You are living as if destined to live forever; your own frailty never occurs to you; you don't notice how much time has already passed, but squander it as though you had a full and overflowing supply.
- The actual time you have - which reason can prolong though it naturally passes quickly - inevitably escapes you rapidly : for you do not grasp it or hold it back or try to delay that swiftest of all things,  but you let it slip away as though it were something superfluous and replaceable.
- It is the sign of a great man, and one who is above human error, not to allow his time to be frittered away: he has the longest possible life simply because whatever time he has available he devoted entirely to himself. None of it lay fallow and neglected, none of it under another's control.
- The man who spends all his time on his own needs, who organizes every day as though it were his last, neither longs nor fear the next day. 
- I am always surprised to see some people demanding the time of others and meeting a most obliging response.
- Putting things off is the biggest waste of life: it snatches away each day as it comes, and denies us the present by promising the future. [...] You are arranging what lies in Fortune's control, and abandoning what lies in yours. 

- Of all people only those at leisure who make time for philosophy, only those are really alive.  For they not only keep a good watch over their own lifetimes, but annex every age to theirs.
- We can argue with Socrates, express doubt with Carneades, cultivate retirement with Epicurus, overcome human nature with the Stoics, and exceed its limits with the Cynics. Since nature allows us to enter into a partnership with every age, why not turn from this brief and transient spell of time and give ourselves wholeheartedly to the past, which is limitless and eternal and can be shared with better men than we?

- [About the eminent deads] None of these will force you to die but all will teach you how to die. None of them will exhaust your years, but each will contribute his years to yours. With none of these will conversation be dangerous, or his friendship fatal, or attendance on him expensive. From them you can take whatever you wish: it will not be their fault if you do not take your fill from them. What happiness, what a fine old age awaits the man who has made himself a client of these! He will have friends whose advice he can ask on the most important or the most trivial matters, whom he can consult daily about himself, who will tell him the truth without insulting him and praise him without flattery, who will offer him a pattern on which to model himself. 

- In this kind of life you will find much that is worth your study: the love and practice of the virtues, forgetfulness of the passions, the knowledge of how to live and die, and a life of deep tranquility.
