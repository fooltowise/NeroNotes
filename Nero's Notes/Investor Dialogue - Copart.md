### How do you look at long run total loss frequency?

Analyst 1: I think the short-term reaction is partly because of everything that is going on in the market but also the price of oil and the fear that it will impact miles driven. That’s what happened last time oil spiked; miles driven came down. That’s the million-dollar question, right off the bat. Everybody I talk to about Copart or IAA, I always ask them this question about the long-term effect of electric vehicles, driver assist and autonomous vehicles. I think it’s helpful to remember that there are a few different main KPIs that you want to focus on. Miles driven is one of them. The other one is the accident rate, which you mentioned. The last piece is the salvage rate. There are really three different pieces.

It’s complicated to get a handle on it because, when you move one thing, another one shifts in another direction. For example, you could say that increased technology will lower the accident rate but, on the other hand, are those cars going to be easier to total because they are so much more expensive? I’ve talked to people and you can now total a car in a 15 mph accident, especially if the airbags go off and all the sensors that are in the bumper become extremely expensive to fix. Suddenly, you’ve totaled that car in a very minor accident. That is the countervailing factor. You could have accidents coming down but you are going to end up totaling a lot more of these cars when they do get in an accident.

The other part of it is, what is the threshold? It still seems as if we are a long way from autonomous vehicles but if there are 3% or 5% on the road, does that matter? What is the tipping point? Is it 20%? 30%? I don’t know. Then there are other countervailing factors too. The accident rate had been falling for years and then, recently, spiked up. Part of it was distracted drivers; people are on their phones. There are all sorts of weird things that can happen.

Partly I think about this in the fact that there are always different variables you go through. So far, I don’t think that the electric vehicle or autonomous vehicle appearing on the horizon is enough to get me concerned. But I would be interested to hear if anybody else has other opinions about it.

Analyst 2: I think this threat was around six years ago, with people overreacting to autonomous driving then. I think our thought process is, it’s going to be challenging because it is something that has to be 100% ready. You can’t be 98% ready. It takes a long time to get that last 2%, 3%, 4% to market. Once it’s available, it’s going to take a long time to see penetration really rise. For Copart, I think they are continuing to benefit. Loss frequency continues to go up to about 20% today. That doesn’t mean it still can’t go to 25% or 30%. It was mid to low double digits 10 years ago. I think that is one of the biggest surprises on our end; loss frequency has gone from 13%, 14% to 19%, in a decade.

It is the cost of repairs. The more technology that is embedded in the vehicle, the more expensive it is to repair. Distraction is prevalent, as well, with cellphones and other items. You look at Copart’s trajectory and the seeds are planting internationally. That is even longer tailwinds for those emerging markets where penetration is nearly as viable as it is in the US. You will continue to businesses thinking they can gain share and convert those markets to something similar to the US market. I think Copart will be in a good spot, for many years.

Analyst 3: If you look at total loss frequency of cars that are 2014 or newer, which is when they changed over to the aluminum base and more sensors and technology, those total loss frequencies and total loss vehicles are now at 25%. You are starting to see a rapid jump, with eight-year-old cars or older, just because of changes that have occurred in the vehicles. As was just said, there is no reason why you couldn’t see it go from 25% to 35% of total loss.

Analyst 4: Just thinking about the environment that we are in, with costs going up in general – wages and materials – that just helps the business here. The value of the vehicles and what it is going to take to replace or fix them increases the potential for them to be totaled anyway, even if you exclude the technology aspect of it and just look at the raw material and labor aspect.

### Isn’t the accident rate one thing that could change or that governments or OEMs are really looking to try and, at least, reduce. We don’t need full AVs to eliminate accidents, for it to have an impact on the units that have been salvaged. If you have increased penetration of ADAS, or better ADAS, the delta could be quite large on the accident rate, effectively. If there is any risk in that total loss frequency, is it from accidents or is there something else that would maybe worry you, that you would be looking at, as a KPI?

Analyst 2: Technology has got significantly better in the last 10 years, but we haven’t really seen loss frequency or accident rate really change. Cars are much more safe, with the sensors, the autobraking and lane assist. All those items are helping, but you still have people on the road, being irrational, and accidents happen. I don’t really see how it’s possible to have a massive impact on accident rate, until you get to 100% fully automated.

Analyst 1: The irony is, in the thick of the whole Covid pandemic, when miles driven had fallen for a little while, the accident rate went up quite a bit. It was speeding and distracted drivers. Suddenly, they could go a lot faster. It’s weird to think about one variable and just change that, because it never happens in isolation; there are always other things. Accident rate would be one and the other thing would be if miles driven somehow went the other way. That’s also hard to see because you have a rising population, but you do have more people staying at home. That is also an important part that drives the others.

Analyst 2: As you said, there are so many different idiosyncratic factors that impact us. People weren’t travelling internationally during Covid, so they vacationed in the States. Then you’ve got other dynamics, such as the car parc aging which means more cars totaled because their average age is 12 years. There are all these different little factors where it is hard to pinpoint one thing that would dictate a trend.

When you add them all together and you look at Copart’s competitive advantage and the market share gained, they profit because of the service they provide and the returns on investment that their clients get. You can see why they are so successful and that’s why I think the multiple has expanded. The market is appreciating the sustainability of the business and you get founders and leaders that are fully invested and are driving a unique culture, at Copart, which is a little harder to define, quantitatively.

Analyst 1: It seems as if that competitive advantage just gets stronger over time because it’s more and more difficult to replace what Copart has built. You’re not going to find places where you can put 30,000 cars, close to a big city.

Analyst 4: It’s like layers of competitive advantage. You have the physical, geographic competitive advantage and then you have the network effects with the distribution side and the auction business with the customers. There are all these aspects to it where it’s competitive advantage layered on competitive advantage, which is very hard to attack. It’s easy to attack one competitive advantage; it’s very hard to attack layers of them, simultaneously.

### Just on the point of the network and the buyer demand, is there any regulatory risk of 31%, 34% of US vehicles being sold internationally? From my understanding, a lot of these are rebuilders or people in foreign countries buying busted US vehicles that may not meet safety regulations and are going to drive them in Europe, or elsewhere. Is there any regulatory risk of arbitraging safety rules in different countries, that could potentially unwind that network effect?

Analyst 2: I’ve not seen anything. I don’t think Mexico is going to come down hard on safety standards on vehicles on the road. I don’t think it’s a huge priority for them. The biggest market, outside the US, is Mexico, with 7% of sales. Then you go to the Middle East, Eastern Europe and other parts of the market and I don’t think it will be a big priority from a safety perspective.

### If these cars are much more complex, with more electronics, can you actually repair them? Or are people in the Middle East just driving around with no sensors, that might not meet US regulations? Is there a risk in the fact that you just can’t rebuild these more complex vehicles, at some point?

Analyst 2: That’s dependent on the ASP. We’ve seen used car prices are high; everyone has noticed that. Less cars are currently being totaled because of that. The insurance companies are going to look at the cost of repair and rental versus what it would be to replace the sensors and bumpers. The higher the used car price, the more likely it is that it will be repaired. Copart have got that natural hedge. They might have less volume but they’ve got higher ASPs through the system. That plus car prices coming down, they might have lower ASP but higher volumes.

Analyst 3: Are you talking about the actual physical way of driving a car if you don’t have a sensor? The functionality?

### Anything. From my understanding, as these cars get more complex, with all these sensor and electronics in the car, plus if they are electric or hybrid engines, if you total these vehicles, are they harder to rebuild and, therefore, less attractive in international markets, where the demand is typically coming from? Could that impact the demand in the auction, if they are not attractive because you actually can’t use them? Therefore, they have to be busted for parts, which is obviously a different buyer base.

Analyst 4: I think it depends on what is damaged. If you have an electric vehicle and the battery is beyond repair and you are going to have to put a brand-new battery in, maybe that’s not as an attractive thing to ship overseas. But if it’s totaled due the ADAS sensors or the rear camera – things that aren’t inherent to the physical drivability of the vehicle where they can just disable it where, when you put it in reverse, the screen just doesn’t pop up – I think that’s a very different conversation than if there is a steel rod through the engine and it’s not going to work.

Analyst 1: A lot of cars get totaled here due to flood damage, for example, but it still makes them perfectly drivable overseas, where they don’t have that problem.

### I’m just thinking from the OEM point of view, it seems as if they are looking to take more control over the vehicle itself and the parts. Could that impact the way that these cars are then resold and rebuilt and, effectively, the unit volume of Copart?

Analyst 4: Unless it goes to something to how it is on an aircraft, where making any changes or putting any parts in there have to be approved by a regulatory agency, like an FAA, then you have a thing like a HEICO, where you are having to go through this whole regulatory process for PMA parts. I think it’s very different if you are taking a vehicle and you are taking parts from it and applying it to a similar vehicle that it still works on; there is no FAA for that.

### There is still a huge car parc, as well, I guess?

Analyst 4: Yes. So unless something comes up, like an FAA for vehicles, in terms of having to have this approved process to fix it, I don’t think you would have that issue.

### If there is anything that worries you about Copart specifically, in the insurance side of the business, what would come to mind?

Analyst 4: Irrational players, primarily. If you go back to the original structure of the industry, why were the insurers originally working with more than one? Why were they working with Copart, IAA and other providers? Originally, it was about keeping everybody honest. As these advantages have aggregated to Copart – and, in my opinion, they offer the best ultimate value – why would you subsidize your competitors? Why wouldn’t the Geicos of the world fully switch over to Copart, if that is where they are getting the best value and then just let their competitors make sure people are keeping prices right.

At some point, you get down to one insurer, who is using multiple providers and they are losing business. I think it does aggregate to one player, unless the insurers decide that, even if it is rational for their own economic benefits, they just want to make sure there is price competition, even if they would get a better outcome by going to a single provider.

Analyst 1: I talked to a former IAA executive and he told me that the insurance industry will never let all the volume just go to Copart. Most of the insurance companies use both. They may give most of the volume to Copart, but they still feel as if they don’t want to put all their eggs in one basket.

Analyst 2: It would be structured relatively benign. Obviously, if the leverage were to shift to Copart meaningfully, IAA would be a completely abandoned industry. It gives us a very true duopoly with these two companies needing to stay in business. We don’t own IAA. Prior to this call, I heard you talking about it and it looks interesting today, perhaps. But it is completely different from what Copart has accomplished.

### What is so different about it?

Analyst 2: The way they operated historically, they didn’t own their lands. They were partly a car auction service, as opposed to true salvage and I don’t think they allocated the resources they probably needed to be able to provide the service, particularly when a catastrophe hits, which is why a lot of market share gains have gone towards Copart. They have the ability to handle hurricanes and the catastrophes particularly well. They take the short-term profit and the long-term market share gains.

IAA is trying to do better, purchasing some land and working on some of the expenses and towing stuff. But it is a different beast, more or less, from how they’ve operated historically. It can be fixed.

Analyst 1: One interesting thing I’d say is that – at least what I’ve found from the customer’s point of view – is that there is not that much difference between Copart and IAA. The actual services they each provide are pretty similar. But from the higher up point of view, that’s where they see the differences. Differences in returns; differences in volumes.

From an investor standpoint, we look at it and Copart, just because it has been built differently, has these advantages that have accumulated over time. It just seems insurmountable for IAA to overcome those. But from the customer’s point of view, they’re not as different.

Analyst 2: The flywheel factor is having a larger buyer base, to create more value and higher returns. That’s really the secret to Copart’s success. I can’t verify that this is 100% true but, in 2012, I think Manheim tried to do salvage for free and they were still making more money with Copart paying them what Manheim could do for free.

Analyst 1: Just to clarify, when I say they are not that different from a customer point of view, I’m talking about lower-level people, such as adjusters and people on the ground. They are dealing with them on a day-to-day basis and putting cars in one yard versus another. But yes, clearly, from a higher level, there is a big difference, with the bigger marketplace that Copart has and the higher returns.

### Why can’t Manheim do this? What do they struggle with?

Analyst 2: They don’t have the online technology and they don’t have the buyers. The VB3 software and online, that investment, historically, allowed Copart to create the marketplace. It’s like when eBay was first created, they had the marketplace and no one has been able to duplicate what Copart did, in the early days. That’s why IAA is trying to switch more online; I guess they’re fully online now.

### When you are looking at the long-term growth opportunity for Copart, specifically in the insurance side of the business, as you said, it’s a duopoly. The units are somewhat stable in the used car industry, as is the totaled rate, and it grows slowly. How do you look at the organic growth rate on the pure insurance side, in the US?

Analyst 4: I think a big opportunity is when you start thinking about turnover. If you look at the overall process, from the day a car gets into an accident and follow it through until it’s sold, there are a lot of days that could be cut out of there. In my opinion, that is a very untapped opportunity. They are attempting to tap it; there are a lot of regulatory aspects and processes that you have to get through. If they could reduce that turn time from 30 days to five, think about the value proposition to the insurers.

Potentially, this could be a risk. If IAA, or somebody else, were to figure this out and patent it where no one else could use it where, five days after your car was totaled, the title is already switched over and now it’s out on their platform, it’s a gamechanger. You are talking about turns of capital for the insurer. Again, this is where there are benefits of aggregating for the bigger players. They earn more and they can spend more on fixing this and they are integrated more. So if they do fix it, it’s instantly a much better product than what IAA can offer.

{audio:0:23:19) I get that insurers don’t want to give everything to one person, but if it’s a difference of turning a vehicle in five days versus 30, that’s something to think about.

Analyst 2: But that’s a DMV issue. You are thinking that a bureaucratic government entity is going to become more efficient?

Analyst 4: If you make a comparison to the title insurance industry, it was a similar thing. It was very local government process oriented. You had to go down to the courthouse and find all these documents. Then the technology came in and said, hey, we will essentially pay you a cut of what we’re earning; let us digitize all this. We’ll give you the process and we’ll make it a lot faster. Maybe it’s naïve to think that could potentially happen but why couldn’t a Copart – or even an IAA – come in here and say, here is this solution for you. Essentially, we’re going to just give it to you for free or you’ll get a cut out of here and we just cut the days from 30 to five. Yes, maybe it costs us X hundreds of millions to implement this, but we’re going to make X billion doing it because of that turn time.

### Is there any difference in the days of turn between IAA and Copart?

Analyst 1: I don’t think so. I think Copart were the first ones to take over title and do that?

Analyst 4: I think the IAA just followed in there.

Analyst 3: IAA has the loan payoff that they recently released. As we’ve said before, the technology is all the same. If one rolls it out, the other one rolls it out. The technology is, basically, the same stuff. IAA offered loan payoff first and Copart announced it and the same with the 360 views.

Analyst 4: The only thing where I would see it would be a potential opportunity is if one side could do it in a way that wasn’t replicable by the other. I don’t know if that’s a given, either way. If both sides can turn at the same speed but Copart is still getting higher ASP, the ASP times the turns is still going to make it a lot more attractive for Copart versus IAA.

### In terms of looking at the organic growth of the core insurance business, excluding the efficiency gains potential, is it purely just the ASP increasing over time, due to more buyers and then total loss frequency edging up that should actually generate mid-single or high-single digit growth?

Analyst 1: Also gains in market share; there is going to be a slow creep there. Additionally, whatever they do internationally is a big question mark.

Analyst 2: They probably have untapped pricing power too. They are pretty cagey on fees and don’t disclose them. I’ve seen them raise their fees quite a bit. I don’t think they charged a buyer fee until that time period, as well.

### They don’t like discussing fees.

Analyst 2: There is some good potential to see some fee increases. Internationally, obviously, is where a lot of the opportunity for the next decade lies. They are going to have the opportunity to get involved with markets they’re investing in today and converting them to more US-based markets.

Analyst 3: I think one of the things that Copart has said in the past is that, if you have the cars, the buyers will come. Historically, that’s been inaccurate. But what they’re focusing on more now is on the buyer side. How do you make that process better? How do you increase membership fees and participation? One of the things that stuck me with, that they said is, you get a member to buy, come in second place and then they get addicted to it – almost like betting – and they continue to bid. I think there is a lot of work going on on the buyer side, for them to unlock a lot of value and continue to increase and monetize that side.

Analyst 4: I think a lot of the growth that we’re talking about – either pricing power or some of this organic market share – a decent chunk of that is free growth. It’s going to be very high returns on incremental invested capital, just because there is not going to be that much more. Obviously, the international will require a lot of upfront stuff, in terms of getting the yards set up. But I think the incremental spend in the US is probably substantially lower.

### Is there any risk for this business in the core insurance? What could go wrong?

Analyst 1: If they have some big setback overseas, that would suck. For example, if Germany, somehow, fell apart, that would be disappointing.

Analyst 4: Or the amount of spend that they put out there to get that system shifted over and IAA gets to come in and benefit on all its spends. There is definitely that risk.

Analyst 2: I don’t worry about their US insurance market growth. Typically, the things we fear, traditionally, have been dumb acquisitions or stuff like that. Copart could go out and buy a wholesale auction company and try to expand beyond the core salvage market. I don’t think that’s the DNA of Jay and Willis. They’ve got a lot of capital stake and they’re not prone to do anything stupid. That would be the theory you would traditionally have, of them trying to gain share outside of their core competencies and core markets.

Analyst 1: I would agree with that and I would second it. Normally, that is the kind of thing you would worry about but, with this company, you’ve got Willis Johnson and Jay Adair and it just seems as if, culturally, that’s not going to happen. I would be surprised.

### They are moving into the whole car?

Analyst 1: It’s possible for them to move up the chain, slowly, over time, yes.

Analyst 2: For them, organically would be the way to do it. They could do it quicker, by acquiring, but it’s not in their DNA to do so.

### On this non-insurance side, do we know, roughly, the mix between dealers, captive fincos, rental companies in terms of the source of that inventory?

Analyst 2: I wish.

Analyst 4: I don’t think they break that out.

Analyst 1: No; I think it’s just insurance and then everybody else.

### I’d be curious as to why you would use Copart rather than Manheim? I guess it’s because you get a better price and a higher return?

Analyst 4: It’s all economics. If you have the audience and you have the potential buyers to pay more on that platform, they’ll switch.

Analyst 1: It’s the same reason as to why you would use someone’s online platform, as opposed to eBay. There are more eyeballs and buyers on eBay.

Analyst 3: A lot of their whole car business – correct me if I’m wrong – but it’s typically the trade-ins, the beat up, 15 year older cars, that no dealer wants anyway, so why not just throw it on the platform and get eyeballs, globally?

### I would just assume that most of their inventory was going internationally, because of that reason? How do you guys look at the recent ADESA acquisition by Carvana and how that filters into what Carvana now have and, if they do move into whole car, who that could potentially impact the whole car space and Copart’s inventory that they get from them?

Analyst 4: I don’t have any strong opinions on that. We own CarMax. Carvana’s acquisition makes sense; they need inventory. This gives them a million cars to sell on their platform and that makes sense, to me. But in terms of impacting Copart, I don’t see any impact. Salvage is still a different beast.

Analyst 3: I’ve heard that dealers may be hesitant to use ADESA, just knowing that it could go to Carvana. You could see an uptick, for a short period of time, where maybe some business wins on the whole-car side, just because dealers are pretty headstrong people and don’t want to give cars or opportunities to competitors. Maybe you could see an uptick there. But there are probably still older cars.

### I’ve always wondered why Copart hasn’t moved, more aggressively, into whole car, given they have all the infrastructure available and, arguably, a bigger buyer network than Manheim? It must be the supply side and they are not willing to provide that inventory to Copart and it just goes, automatically, to Manheim. I guess the big captive fincos have these long-term agreements, to sell their inventory to Manheim. I wonder, over time, if Copart just has so much scale, globally, that it becomes more attractive to sell via Copart?

Analyst 2: That’s an investment opportunity for them. I think they’re coming out with Copart Select. If they want to move upstream, they will do it gradually. They will maybe continue to move supply around, as well. It’s going to take time. They’re not going to sell an $80,000 Audi on the platform. People aren’t looking to go to Copart for a set vehicle. Over time, if you can continue to get people to evolve to a less damaged, more drivable and higher-priced cars, that’s obviously an opportunity for them.

Analyst 3: It is a different beast. You have to worry about reconditioning, stack them, versus making them still presentable. I’ve talked to Copart before and they were saying, we don’t want to do anything; it’s out of our core competencies. It just seems as if it’s more of a gradual approach and they will get it figured out, if they do decide to go down that route, faster.

### I was looking at ACV and they have an ASP of 4,000 to 5,000, normalized for this crazy period. Obviously, it’s a bit higher than Copart but they do seem to attract all of the crappy dealer cars that they don’t want to keep on their lot. It goes through ACV auctions. What are your views around the fact that Copart are now also buying from consumers? That seems like a bit of a test. As you said, the biggest challenge with Carvana is that these businesses do need inventory to put through their auctions. Copart is also merging with wholesale auctions. They are all vertically integrated and they get access to more inventory, because they realize they need the inventory to put it through their pipes. Is that not a limitation for Copart, at some point, where they have obviously maxed out the salvage game, to some extent, and they have to start to moving to whole car and other spaces, to actually get access to more inventory, to grow?

Analyst 4: If they max out the salvage business, it’s still going to be a home run. The rest just ends up being a little bit of gravy on top. I think there is still just plenty of space, just on the salvage side, to keep growing, both in volumes and taking price. The rest of this is upside. I don’t think you have to understand that, to get behind an investment thesis on it, today. Maybe 10 years from now, it’s a problem.

Analyst 1: The business still seems to be getting better, with age. I pointed out before, just with the advantages, but you can even see it in the numbers. Gross profit margin has gone from 42% in 2016, 43%, 44%, 46%, 50%. SG&A, as a percentage of sales goes from 9.7, 9.1, 8.6, 7.6, 7.2. You’ve got the margins widening.

### Do you think they shouldn’t start owning more of that SG&A, such as the towing and logistics? At some point, does it make sense with the scale they have?

Analyst 2: They’ve got good relationships with so many different towing companies that I don’t think it’s an asset they need to own. They do have some of their fleet, primarily for catastrophe events. A big massive event that changed the industry in favor of Copart was the North East New Jersey – hurricane Sandy – where the towing crisis was astronomical, because there was no ability to get to the shores of Jersey, to get those cars out. You were paying four, five, six-fold – maybe more – just to tow the vehicle.

Copart handled that very well because they did have a little bit more land and space. But the industry changed and market share gains were won, primarily, with that storm, because of how they were able to service their clients better. I think, allowed them to go ahead and invest in their own fleet, for catastrophe, build more land near coastal regions, just for the next hurricane. Hurricane Harvey and the flooding in Houston was a prime example of how they were more prepared for that.

### What about Germany? It seems as if, over the last few years, they’ve ramped up a lot. I think they’ve built 14 or 15 sites or yards, in the last three or four years, in Germany. We’ve done some work on the market which seems to be completely different in how the insurers work with salvage. Is this a long-term opportunity of changing the way the industry works, for Copart?

Analyst 2: They are trying to convince the insurance companies that their model is superior. I think, traditionally, if you are in an accident in Germany, the insurance will write you a check for the difference between your car’s price, pre-accident, and the salvage price. It’s up to you to dispose of the car. They give you an offer and you accept it or you try to find another buyer. It’s a lot more hassle for the consumer. Whereas in the US, the insurance company totals it, writes you a check and you go and buy a new vehicle.

It’s a long process to convince them that the consignment models and their approach is superior. They’ve been there a long time and it’s taking a long time. If they can prove it to be successful, that’s a massive opportunity to be the leader in Europe, because they have the firepower.

Analyst 1: I think Germany is the largest market, outside the US; it’s obviously enormous. People look at the UK market and I think Copart makes more, per car, in the UK, than they do here, in the US. People are looking at Germany and if that trend continues, with the size of that market, it could be a big opportunity, five or 10 years from now.

### They’ve been there 15 or 16 years.

Analyst 4: It’s like seeds; they take a while to grow. You’re having to change decades and decades and decades of the way that insurers have thought about doing business. You’re going to do that one insurer at a time, one person at that insurer at a time. You have to make those investments upfront. Again, is this where somebody else can come in and piggyback on that? Yes. Copart is trailblazing it there, but the fact that they are making the investments, in those locations, they’re going to be the prime locations, in terms of towing distances and they should still have a cost advantage there.

It wouldn’t surprise me if, five or six years from now, we’re still looking at it and it’s still not fully developed; maybe even 10 years from now. But, at that point, the US business probably starts becoming much more mature, on the salvage side and Germany just starts ramping up.

Analyst 2: They want to go to the emerging growth markets as well, such as China and India, where they are also looking to plant seeds. Those are the fastest growing areas where auto penetration is the lowest, but will be much larger three decades from now. They are very long-term in their approach which, again, is why we don’t worry about Copart too much.

Analyst 1: They are smart about how they do that. I talked to the former CEO of Copart Middle East and North Africa and he was talking about how they will own land but only in jurisdictions where they are pretty safe and secure. They have, basically, covered their downsides. They would use all kinds of dealers in Turkey and these other markets but maybe they don’t quite invest in the land. I don’t remember all the details, but I remember coming away being pretty impressed that, even in those kind of emerging markets, they are pretty thoughtful about how they construct the business, so if it doesn’t work out, they’re not going to get hit.

### Does anybody else have anything to raise around either an opportunity for Copart that you would like to see them attack or maybe a risk that worries you?

Analyst 2: In the last couple of years, the risk has sometimes been valuation based.

Analyst 1: I was going to say something like that. The risks are things that are really not necessarily business risks and are in their control. They are just big macro things that affect anything else that you own. We have no control over what interest rates do and the valuation of stock. I can’t think of anything specific.

Analyst 2: In 2013, the stock was trading around 13 times EBIT at the time. I thought it was fair, but the multiple has expanded significantly, as the business has got significantly better, over the last seven or eight years. We didn’t expect loss frequency to go from 14% to 20%. That has been a big part of their success.

I think the competitive positioning has got much stronger. You’ve seen the market share gains they’ve taken from IAA. Is there a risk that IAA can fix itself and become more competitive and, maybe, take some share back at the margin? Maybe. But once you have that network and you have the buyers and sellers, it’s really hard to steal those away both parties are getting good service and good value, so the value proposition remains in the top tier. Again, there are two things that are outside of control; market-based, industry-based valuation things where you could maybe see things re-rate a little bit.

Analyst 4: Today, you’re looking at 28 times trailing EPS. That has been growing at 20%, 25% a year. You are getting a 3.5% yield today, growing. If you assume it grows at 20% and then you get 50% multiple compression, this thing is still getting you at least 13% IRR.

Analyst 1: If this re-rates, what is going to happen to other stuff?

Analyst 4: Exactly. I think, from here, people look at it as 28 or 30 times and say, it’s crazy; I don’t think it’s that crazy.

Analyst 2: We do spend a lot of time assessing management; it’s one of the unique compensation stories out there. Jay and those guys don’t pay themselves a salary bonus. It’s all equity-based options that they grant every five years. They are fully invested with shareholders, trying to get their share price higher. In 2013, before they split, the stock was trading around 35 or so and their option grant, the year prior, was 36 strike. The stock was under water for a year and a half and they did a 14% Dutch auction, to buy back a significant amount of stock.

If you were to see a re-rating of the stock, they have shown, historically and over time, that they buy back stock in meaningful amounts when they think it is attractive. That gives us a little more security and valuation protection, versus other companies out there.

### I think they’ve been buying back shares regularly.

Analyst 2: They haven’t done it in a massive amount in the last five years because the multiples are what they are. If it were to be weakened, I think they would step up. They’ve run a pretty clean balance sheet.

Analyst 3: Obviously, there was a massive land expansion in the 2020 program that they had. They still had capital.

### Just going back to this point about the buyer base, what could be the risks where they could see that unwind or less demand. Obviously, it’s been growing forever, globally. Is there any reason why you could get an unwind of the network effect?

Analyst 4: Ultimately, it comes down to the value being created. There is a spread between what these buyers are able to buy from Copart and fix it to a condition they need to be able to sell it. The factors of that spread could change. If cost inflation in the target end countries is going up substantially faster than what the ASP is in the US, when that spread collapses, does it make sense for someone to buy from somewhere else? On the buyer base, ultimately, they are going to buy where they are getting the highest spread.

### What about from the insurer’s side? If you are an insurer today, let’s say, in five or 10 years’ time, Carvana has a 100 IRCs and more for Copart, with the ability to actually repair and recondition a chunk of these potential total losses and the insurer can then sell at retail. Is there a way that Carvana, with ADESA, could actually adjacently come and compete with Copart, for some of that inventory that the insurers own?

Analyst 4: There are multiple pieces to that. Yes, Carvana have the IRCs, but are the component parts of the vehicle going to get cheaper? That’s only part of it; are they going to be able to train and hire mechanics at a cheaper rate than they are today? I think that’s another big question. There are a lot of aspects there. You could have the IRCs but that’s only one physical piece of it.

Analyst 1: There’s the whole logistics of it. You’ve got to get people to tow the thing to lots.

### But won’t they have that?

Analyst 2: It’s very capital intensive. I think Carvana looks at their market share opportunities and it wouldn’t be economically smart to try to go to a very capital-intensive part of the market, to do it themselves. This is a pretty efficient way for the insurance company to dispose of vehicles. The best profit metric they can get is selling to a repair shop or somewhere internationally. I can’t see anyone else fully wanting to do that. The opportunities sat in front of them are much greater and less capital intensive.

Analyst 4: Think of the turns piece here, for the insurance company. They just want this to get done, get their capital out there and moving on. But if now have to take the vehicle, get it to an IRC, wait for it to be repaired and then, if you’re having to sell it at retail, now you have the time gap from getting it from the IRC to the sale point. That’s probably a much longer process than what is going to be the process of just going to Copart.

### Unless Carvana buy it?

Analyst 4: They could but, again, think of the spreads.

### My point is that the spread will be higher selling it at retail versus a repair shop. There’s a portion of the total loss frequency that the insurer and adjuster is pushing through to recycle that capital. Whereas, if there is a player like Carvana, potentially, that has the infrastructure there to repair, recondition and sell at retail – or at wholesale if they have ADESA – it could start competing for that inventory.

Analyst 3: CarLotz has a good sight on what they are trying to do to disrupt some of the industry more, on the wholesale side. That is a different beast. I feel that where Carvana is trying to attack is less out of salvage, clearly, and the whole car market; a big addressable market. It seems as if there is enough room for everyone to win.

### They’d be brave trying to compete with Copart.

Analyst 4: I think there are much easier fights out there.
