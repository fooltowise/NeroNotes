# Cognitive Biases

Since the goal of epistemic rationality is to improve the accuracy of our beliefs, let's consider what could cause us to adopt false beliefs: 

- Ignorance (in the general term): the lack of knowledge for a particular situation causes us to reach a false conclusion. This error is not too bad: often gathering more data systematically improves the accuracy of our conclusion
- But there are case when, even when we are provided with all the information needed, the resulting belief we adopt is wrong. **The machinery of our mind systematically generates wrong outputs from correct inputs: these cases are called cognitive biases.** Gathering more knowledge won't help us to reach the correct conclusion, but thinking in another way may help.
