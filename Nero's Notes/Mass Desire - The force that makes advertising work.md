# Mass desire : The force that makes advertising work


Copy cannot create desire for a product. It can only take the hopes, dreams, fears and desires that already exist in the hearts of millions of people, *and focus those already existing desires onto a particular product*.

This mass desire must already exist. You cannot create it. And you cannot fight it. *But you can - and must - direct it, channel it, focus is onto your particular product.*


What are these nation-wide forces that create this mass desire? There are many of them, but they fall into two general categories:

**Permanent Forces**
*Mass Instinct*. The desire of women to be attractive, or men to be virile, or men and women both to keep their health. In this case, the instinct never fades - the desire never changes. The copy writer's problem is not to pick out the trend - it is there for everyone to see. His job is to distinguish his product from the others that were there before it - to create a fresh appeal - to build a stronger believability - to shift desire from the fulfilment offered by one product to that offered by another. 
A *mass technological problem*. Bad television reception, or corroding automobile mufflers, or the time it takes for aspirin to bring relief. Until the problem is finally solved, the customers will buy and try - buy and try again. And here the copy writer has the same problem - to offer the same claim of relief as his competitors, but offer it in a new way.



**The forces of change**

*The beginning, the fulfilment, and the reversal of a trend.* Style. The sudden mass decision to show off a pay raise by installing a swimming pool in the back yard, instead of buying a bigger car. The horsepower appeal of the Fifties, and its sudden subordination to gas economy. Here the copy writer is dealing with the straws in the wind that may indicate a hurricane. Here he needs sensitivity, foresight, intuition. He must be able to see and catch the rising tide when it's almost imperceptible - sense which of the several appeals that are built into hiss product he should stress at any particular moment, and when to shift to another - and, always, how to be there first.

*Mass Education*. The school primer and the movie screen. The tastes and appearances of society women, television stars, presidential candidates, trickling down to every hamlet in America. Group pressure; backyard gossip; community product pioneers. And equally important, the sum total of *all* advertising - in its unconscious, unplanned and overall effect of multiplying people's dreams and desires, and thus raising their standard of living. Here again the problem is timing. When does the shift become statistically significant? When do *enough people* make the change? When should the automotive powerhouse, for example, change its image to become the common man's gas saver?

The copywriter is faced with a society containing dozens - even hundreds - of these already existing mass desires. His first job before is to detect them - inventory them - chart their force and direction. This is a study that will occupy part of every working day of the rest of his life. His second job is to harness his products onto their backs.


## How to channel mass desire onto your particular product

The copy writer in his work uses three tools: his own knowledge of people's hopes, dreams, desires and emotions; his client's product; and the advertising message, which connects the two.

The copy writer performs his work in three stages. 
1. *Choose the most powerful desire that can be applied to your product*.
   Every mass desire has three vital dimensions. The first is urgency, intensity, degree of demand to be satisfied. For example, constant arthritic pains compared to a minor headache. The second dimension is staying power, degree of repetition, the inability to become satiated. For example, raw hunger compared to a craving for gourmet foods. And the third dimension is scope - the number of people who share this desire. For example, the number of men willing to pay $10 for an automative accessory that saves gas - as compared to those willing to pay the same price for one that merely prevents future repair bills.
   Every product appeals to two, three or four of these mass desires. But only one can predominate; only one can reach out through your headline to your customer. Only one is the key that unlocks the maximum economic power at the particular time your advertisement is published. *Your choice among these alternate desires is the most important step you will take in writing an ad.* If it is wrong, nothing else that you do in the ad will matter. This choice is embodied in your headline. It is for this reason that we spend so many chapters on headlines later on.
2. *Acknowledge that desire - reinforce it - and/or offer the means to satisfy it - in a single statement in the headline of your ad.* 
   This headline is the bridge between your prospect and your product. It touches your prospect at the point of awareness that he has arrived at today. If he is aware of your product, and realises that it can satisfy his desire, your headline starts with your product. If he is not aware of your product, but only of the desire itself, your headline starts with the desire. And, if he is not yet aware of what he really seeks, but is concerned only with a general problem, your headline starts with that problem and crystallises it into a specific need.
3. *And then you take the series of performances that are built into your product - what your product does - and you show your prospect how these product performances inevitably satisfy that desire.*
   In reality, every product you are given to sell is actually two products. One of them is the *physical* product - the steel, glass, paper or tobacco that the manufacturer has shaped into a particular patter, of which he is justly proud. The other is the *functional* product - the product in action - the series of benefits that your product performs for your consumer, and on the basis of which he buys your product. 
   
   The physical part of your product does not sell. The important part of your product is what it does. The rest - the steel skeleton - the chrome or metal case that you actually deliver to your customer - is only your excuse for charging them your price. What they are really paying you for is what the product will do.
   
   Your first task, then, in studying your product, is **to list the number of different performances it contains - to group these performances against the mass desires that each of them satisfies - and then to feature the one performance that will harness the greatest sales power onto your product at that particular time.**

Take the automobile for instance. Every automobile offers its prospective owner several different and distinct sets of performances:
- It offers him transportation. The ability to carry himself, his family, his luggage, and perhaps in the case of station wagons his pets and his furniture from place to place.
- It offers him dependability. The freedom from breakdown, stalling, poor performance, repair bills, embarrassment and inconvenience.
- It offers him economy. Inexpensive transportation: savings in both gas and oil; freedom from repair bills, seen this from from the point of view of the pocket book: durability high trade-in value, low insurance cost.
- It offers him power. Number of horses at his command; take-off at the lights: acceleration on hills and in traffic; top speed, even if he never uses it. All adding up to a feeling of dominance on the highway.
- It offers him recognition. Admiration, status, subtle and accepted bragging, envy, the feeling of having arrived. The ohs and ahs of his neighbours, the first ride, the very smell of a new car. 
- It offers him value. The number of feet of steel he can command for the price. High trade-in value over the years. The fact that the car can last for 100'000 miles, even if he can afford to trade it in every year.
- It offers him novelty. Power steering five years ago - electric door locks today. Three-tone paint jobs yesterday - iridescent paints now. The thrill of being the leader, the pace- setter, the proven pioneer.
And many more.
**And yet your ad can feature only one of these performances; can effectively tap only one mass desire at a time.**
Your headline is limited by physical space. You have only one glance of the reader's eye to stop him. He is preoccupied - he is not looking for your product or your message - the span of his attention will admit only one thought to penetrate his indifference during that glance.
