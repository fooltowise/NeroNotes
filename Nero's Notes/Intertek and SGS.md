See [[Assurance Benefits]]

Consumers buy goods with expectations that they will meet certain standards. Beef buyers expect merchantable food and purchasers of home appliance expect effective performance. Consumer willingness to pay, which defines the seller's pricing power, is directly related to a product's expected quality.  [[Pricing power]] can be sustained only if customer expectations are consistently met.

Yet modern vendors face two challenges. On one hand, supply chains are growing longer and more complex. In previous eras, manufacturers controlled much of their production process but today they outsource a great deal, often to remote outposts around the globe. Producers must still vouch for their products but have far less control over their inputs. On the other hand, consumers and regulators alike are growing more circumspect, demanding greater corporate accountability. Technology broadcasts failures around the world so that product problems are rarely local any more.

To address the challenge of reduced information about production processes combined with the increasing costs of deviation from standards, producers are increasingly turning to testing services. These are impartial qualified referees who provide product assurance, offering a seal of approval that customers value. Much like traditional auditors and rating agencies, testing companies such as Bureau Veritas, Intertek and SGS have for more than a century staked their reputations on such products, commodity, assets and process certifications. Testing companies with strong [[Reputation as signaling| reputations]] can charge clients more, as producers buy a sign of confidence in product quality. But even for premium testing services, such assurance remains a negligible component of overall product costs. 

Testers boasting global capabilities command both stronger reputations among clients an greater pricing power, making [[Economies of Scale| scale]] a barrier to entry. Scale can also improve institutional knowledge, speed turnaround times and drive the unit cost of testing down. Testing services become an attractive alternative to in-house testing. Often, client also need to allow testing companies to integrate into their information technology and operations platforms, The considerable fixed upfront costs this entails tend to lock producers into engaging and retaining only two or three nominated testing services, rather than multiple rivals competing for the business. These traits manifest in the economic results of global testing service companies, some of which enjoy margins exceeding 30% and hefty returns on capital in their consumer goods testing businesses.
