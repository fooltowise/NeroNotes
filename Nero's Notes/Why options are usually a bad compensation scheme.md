**Options don't mean alignment of interests with shareholders, and may even lead to more risk taking.**

Ironically, the rhetoric about options frequently describes them as desirable because they put managers and owners in the same financial boat. In reality, the boats are far different. No owner has ever escaped the burden of capital costs, whereas the holder of a fixed-price option bears no capital cost at all. An owner must weigh upside potential against downside risk; an option holder has no downside.

Managers regularly engineer ten-year, fixed-price options for themselves and associates that, first, totally ignore the fact that retained earnings automatically build value and, second, ignore the carrying cost of capital. As a result, these managers end up profiting , much as they would have had they had an option on that savings account that was automatically building up in value.

If Fred Futile, CEO of Stagnant, Inc., receives a bundle of ten-years options - let's say enough to given him an option on 1% of the company - his self interest is clear: he should skip dividends entirely and instead use all the company's earnings to repurchase stock.

Let's assume that under Fred's leadership Stagnant lives up to its name. In each of the ten years after the option grant, it earns $1 billion on $10 billion of net worth, which initially comes to $10 per share on the 100 million shares then outstanding. Fred eschews dividends and regularly uses all earnings to repurchase shares. If the stock constantly sells at ten times earnings per share, it will have appreciated 158% by the end of the option period. That's because repurchases would reduce the number of shares to 38.7 million by that time, and earnings per share would thereby increase to $25.80.

Simply by withholding earnings from owners, Fred gets very rich, making a cool $158 million, despite the business improving not at all. Astonishingly, Fred could have made more than $100 million if Stagnant's earnings had *declined* by 20% during the 10 years period. Fred can also get a splendid result for himself by paying no dividends and deploying the earnings he withholds from shareholders into a variety of disappointing projects and acquisitions. Even if these initiatives deliver a paltry 5% return, Fred will still make a bundle. Specifically - with Stagnant's p/e ratio remaining unchanged at ten - Fred's option will deliver him $63 million. Meanwhile, his shareholders will wonder what happened to the "alignment of interests" that was supposed to occur when Fred was issued options.


**Options can be appropriate under some circumstances if they are structured right**

They should be awarded only to those managers with overall responsibility. Managers with limited areas of responsibility should have incentives that pay off in relation to results under their control. 

Second, options should be structured carefully. Absent special factors, they should have built into them a retained-earnings or carrying-cost factor. Equally important, they should be priced realistically... options should be priced at true business value.
