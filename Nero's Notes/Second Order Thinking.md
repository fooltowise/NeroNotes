We don't make decisions in a vacuum and we can't get something for nothing. When making choices, considering consequences can help us avoid future problems. we must ask ourselves the critical question: And then what?
Consequences come in many varieties, some more tangible than others. Thinking in terms of the system in which you are operating will allow you to se that your consequences have consequences. Thinking through a problem as far as you can with the information you have allows us to consider time, scale, thresholds, and more. And weighting different paths is what thinking is all about. A little time spent thinking ahead can save us massive amounts of time later.
