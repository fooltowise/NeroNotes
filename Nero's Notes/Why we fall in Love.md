# Why we fall in Love

Why has that man fallen in love with that woman? Because she's pretty.

Why does pretty matter? Because human beings are a mainly monogamous species and so males are choosy about their mates (as male chimpanzees are not); prettiness is an indication of youth and health, which are indication of fertility.

Why does that man care about fertility in his mate? because if he did not, his genes would be eclipsed by those of men who did.

Why does he care about that? He does not, but his genes act as if they do. Those who choose infertile mates leave no descendants. Therefore everybody is descended from men who preferred fertile women and every person inherits from those ancestors the same preference.

Why is that man a slave to his genes? He is not. He has free will. But you just said he's in love because it is good for his genes. He's free to ignore the dictates of his genes.

Why do his genes want to get together with her genes anyway? Because that is the only way they can get into the next generation; human beings have two sexes which must breed by mixing their genes.

Why do human beings have two sexes? Because in mobile animals hermaphrodites are less good at doing two things at once than males and females are at each doing his or her own thing. Therefore ancestral hermaphroditic animals were outmanoeuvred by ancestral sexed animals.

But why only two sexes? Because that was the only way to settle a long-running genetic dispute between two sets of genes.
