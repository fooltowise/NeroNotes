# [[Moody's]] and [[Standard & Poor's]]

## Market Infrastructure, Part 2

Banks, regulators, and fixed income investors rely on Moody’s and S&P to provide a consistent and standardized metric of credit risk across names and over time.  As I explained in [The Self-Reinforcing Standards Moat](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/mco/):

_…ratings underpin the risk weightings that banks attach to assets to determine capital requirements, dictate which securities a money market fund can own, and, in ostensibly surfacing the credit risk embedded in fixed income securities, make it easier for two parties to confidently price and trade, enhancing market liquidity._

_Because of such industry-wide adoption, a debt issuer has little choice but to pay Moody’s for a rating if it hopes to get a fair deal in the market: an issuer of $500mn in 10-year bonds might pay the company 6bps ($300k) upfront, but will save 30bps in interest expense every year ($15mn over the life of the bond)….and each incremental issuer who pays the toll only further reinforces the Moody’s ratings as the standard upon which to coalesce, fostering still further participation. This feedback loop naturally evolves into a deeply entrenched oligopoly._

A similar standards moat [applies to FICO](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/fico-ccas/)….

_Like a Moody’s rating, the [[FICO]] credit score’s ubiquity reinforces adoption: it wouldn’t make sense for a bank to suddenly adopt an alternative, less widely used credit score (even if that score were equivalently predictive) given how hard it would be to reconcile the new rubric with the [[FICO]] Score that is already woven into its risk management process and being used to tag, price, and otherwise evaluate millions of borrowers already in its system (according to management, at least one bank has [[FICO]] Scores embedded in 67 mission critical applications).  The [[FICO]] Score is the industry standard for seeing how one borrower’s creditworthiness has trended over time and for comparing one borrower’s creditworthiness to another’s._

Likewise, the utility of equity indices like the Russell 2000, FTSE 100, S&P 500, and The Dow Jones, is derived from consensus rather than from absolute standards of reasonableness.  The Dow Jones Index methodology, which weights its 30 constituents by share price, is routinely mocked as non-sensical, but its absurdity is more feature than bug as it suggests that a more sensible index couldn’t just come along and displace it the same way that a better technology might, in theory, replace entrenched network effects. 

And once this IP is embedded in the asset management edifice, it is monetized primarily in the form of subscription revenue and fees tied to the AUM of ETFs that reference that IP.

Besides asset-based and subscription revenue, S&P Global’s Indices segment, a joint venture 27% owned by CME Group[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/spgi_mco/#easy-footnote-bottom-1-22961), also derives revenue from royalties pegged to exchange trading activity of derivative contracts linked to S&P and Dow Jones’ indices.  Compared to S&P, [[MSCI]][<sup>2</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/spgi_mco/#easy-footnote-bottom-2-22961) doesn’t monetize as well through trading volumes of derivative contracts, though this is an area of growing focus for management. 

That ETFs will account for a growing share of institutional assets seems like a safe prediction.  ETFs can be traded throughout the day and even sold short to manage risk; are generally more tax efficient than mutual funds, which pass on the capital gains taxes of trading activity to investors; and don’t bear the administrative burden of customer support and communications, which translates into lower expenses for investors.  In short, ETFs offer the same exposure to styles, industries, geographies, etc. as a mutual fund, but for lower fees and with the liquidity and efficiency of an exchange-traded security. 

It is little wonder that they have attracted so much interest:

The attributes that make ETFs so attractive in equities apply to fixed income.  Fixed income ETFs are earlier on the adoption curve – its $1tn of assets accounting for just [1.5% of the total investable fixed income universe](https://www.ssga.com/library-content/products/fund-docs/etfs/us/education/fixed-income-etfs-fact-vs-fiction.pdf)[<sup>3</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/spgi_mco/#easy-footnote-bottom-3-22961) compared to equity ETFs making up ~[8% of global equity market cap](https://www.sifma.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/SIFMA-Insights-Who-Owns-Stocks-in-America.pdf)[<sup>4</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/spgi_mco/#easy-footnote-bottom-4-22961) [<sup>5</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/spgi_mco/#easy-footnote-bottom-5-22961) – but adoption is growing.

Trading in fixed income ETFs has gotten so liquid that [they are presumably seen as a more reliable indicator of transactable prices than the underlying bonds that they actually own](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-12/the-bull-market-caught-a-virus?sref=wkvjYMRd)…if you have a portfolio of bonds that you’d like to liquidate, you might be better off giving those bonds to an ETF manager in exchange for ETF shares, which you can then sell for cash.  In “transfer of assets” deals, institutional investors are transferring bond portfolios to their broker-dealers in exchange for ETFs, which are more liquid and can be traded more cost effectively.  When the Fed launched its Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility in May to restore confidence in corporate credit, rather than acquiring the actual cash bonds, it purchased bond ETFs, becoming [among the largest owners in several of them](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-29/fed-becomes-no-3-holder-of-world-s-biggest-corporate-bond-etf).

The ascendency of ETFs specifically and passive investing generally reinforces and reflects a shift in how we’ve come to think about investing, which is increasingly seen as being less about betting on companies and more about assuming exposures to factors and themes.  We don’t buy Google based on a considered analysis of its future business prospects; Google just happens to tilt a portfolio toward US large cap quality or whatever.  Maybe alpha is just a temporary placeholder for factors that have yet to be discovered and named.  Maybe factors, rather than narratives and cash flows, are a more direct way of expressing what we really want, an efficient abstraction that makes it easier to put money to work vs. studying the unique properties of individual companies.

But while factors may provide convenient after-the-fact descriptions of a portfolio’s performance relative to an index, they aren’t fundamental explanations, right?  We can say “Portfolio X outperformed over the last 5 years because it was overweight momentum or tech” or predict that “Value is due for a rebound after so many year of underperformance” but at a more fundamental level, behind the ETFs and factors are organized collections of people and assets and IP that create the cash flows we as investors fundamentally care about.  So I still read through SEC filings and try to understand each company I own, like a Neanderthal.  But a huge and growing amount of capital is managed by investment programs oriented around factors and themes.

And as a result, the number of indices that one can create is restricted only by the imagination.  All that’s really required to build a new index is a critical mass of interest from managers seeking a new angle to attract more assets.  As they succeed and more managers follow, the new factor gets baked into the investment firmament and ceases to serve as a point of differentiation, renewing the scramble for new themes and factor combinations.  It’s not just that new indices can be created out of thin air; it’s that they inevitably are, often based on what’s working or trendy at the time – “here’s the same index as before, but an ESG version or a low volatility version”; “investors are crazy about tech/disruption, here’s a [‘moonshot’ ETF](https://www.direxion.com/product/moonshot-innovators-etf)”:

The incumbent benchmark providers, already deeply embedded in the workflows of giant asset managers and commanding widespread brand recognition and credibility, are uniquely well positioned to benefit.  S&P and Moody’s can use ESG datasets, for instance, to create consistent index methodologies that are readily adopted with less sales and marketing effort than those from an upstart of unknown merit.  

For at least the last 6 or 7 years, self-indexing by asset owners and downstream disintermediation by the BlackRock/Vanguard duopoly, who [command close to 2/3 share of ETF assets](https://www.morningstar.com/insights/2019/08/01/etf-market-share), have been cited as competitive threats, particularly for [[MSCI]], which derives 12% of its revenue from Blackrock and also competes with the latter in analytics[<sup>6</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/spgi_mco/#easy-footnote-bottom-6-22961).  But I think the feedback loop in standards IP is just too powerful to arrest.  The decision to benchmark against one index over another ultimately rests with asset _owners_ who contractually mandate that their managers perform and constrain tracking error against familiar indices.  ETFs pegged against those familiar indices reflexively attract more liquidity, which reduces the end client’s total cost of trading to a degree that largely offsets the 2 or 3 basis point fee that BlackRock and Vanguard would save and pass on to clients by creating their own IP (that [[MSCI]]’s fees have fallen from 3.4bps of ETF AUM in 2014 to 2.8bps in 2019, is a function of price breaks kicking in at higher AUM thresholds as well as mix issues – the most well-known flagship indices command better pricing than less mature indices – rather than price concessions to powerful ETF distributors).

Switching index providers entails transaction costs and capital gains events as well as the possibility of AUM losses, so ETF managers don’t do so frivolously.  The next best thing to self-indexing, extremely cheap or even free indices manufactured by competitors and broker-dealers, has been wafted in front of clients for years.  In the past, Russell, S&P, and NASDAQ, in their attempts to build international index franchises, tried undercutting [[MSCI]] on price.  Vanguard’s 2012 decision to [transition $131bn of AUM across 22 ETFs](https://ir.msci.com/news-releases/news-release-details/msci-comments-vanguards-planned-transition-index-fund-benchmarks) from [[MSCI]] to Russell is the only major index switch that I can think of[<sup>7</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/spgi_mco/#easy-footnote-bottom-7-22961) and even this ostensibly calamitous loss – $131bn was nearly 40% of the ETF AUM linked to [[MSCI]] indices at the end of 2012 – has been rendered nothing more than blip by subsequent inflows and market appreciation:

![](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Picture8.png)

There may eventually come a time when ETF distributors and index providers bludgeon each other over the marginal dollar and vertically integrate into one another’s territory.  Or maybe the industry converges to a place where BlackRock allies with [[MSCI]], Vanguard with FTSE and these vertically integration cross-sections compete in relative harmony (I think an [[MSCI]]/BlackRock merger could make sense, though I doubt regulators would ever let that happen for anti-trust reasons).  But for now, the secular trends are strong enough that incumbents are thriving under the current paradigm. 

I see the commercial arrangement between index IP owners and ETF distributors as somewhat akin to the relationship that [[FICO]] has with the credit bureaus.  [[FICO]] owns the algorithm used to underwrite 90%+ of all credit decisions in the US, but the credit bureaus directly own the relationships with the banks and lenders who use [[FICO]] scores.  Just as [[FICO]]’s dominant algorithm is combined with credit data owned by an oligopoly of consumer credit bureaus to create a [[FICO]] credit score that is then sold to banks and lenders, so is [[MSCI]] and SPGI’s index IP translated into ETFs and other products by BlackRock and State Street, and then sold to the asset managers, insurance companies, pension funds, and wealth managers.  The same dynamic exists between IP owners and exchanges where, for instance, ICE and CBOE provide the venues on which [[MSCI]]’s and S&P’s index derivatives are traded.  One oligopoly owns the IP; another provides distribution.  It’s a comfortable and lucrative setup.

SPGI’s Indices segment, a 73%-owned JV with CME Group, comprises 13% of S&P Global’s total EBITA.  Another 12% of profit comes from Platts, a 110-year old company that supplies benchmark pricing for various commodities (crude, natural gas, coal, sugar, wheat, rice, etc) as well as supply/demand analytics to physical producers on a subscription basis.  Platts’ essential function as a pricing mechanism is reflected in its 95% retention rates, 55% EBITDA margins, and its seeming imperviousness to commodity price fluctuations (even with the unprecedented collapse of crude futures prices, Platts still generated organic revenue growth of 5%/3%/5% in 1q/2q/3q this year, consistent with past years).  

Indices and Platts pale in significance compared to Ratings, which accounts for nearly 60% of S&P’s EBITA.  S&P’s and Moody’s ratings revenue has each grown by 19% ytd vs. a year ago, respectively, well faster than the compared to high-single digit growth from 2011 to 2019.  Moody’s Issuer Services (MIS) segment, which breaks out ratings revenue by credit category, reports 31% growth in revenue from corporate finance issuance, which in turn has been fueled by 93% growth in investment grade revenue and 51% growth in high yield.  The flurry of issuance raises reasonable concerns that refinancings have been pulled forward. 

But according to S&P, most of the corporate bond issuance this year has been dedicated to “general corporate purposes” and reshoring the balance sheet in for COVID rather than repaying debt.  There has been some pull-forward of 2021 maturities but otherwise the pipeline of corporate maturities has expanded.  Moody’s estimates that theh refinancing needs of North American and European issuers over the next 4 years has increased by 10% ytd.

It may be that companies who raised all this capital as a precautionary measure but then didn’t burn through as much of it as feared or aren’t seeing as many M&A opportunities as hoped, will now spend the next several years deleveraging.  But I can also see a scenario in which investment grade credits, which accounted for 20% of MIS’ LTM revenue, feel comfortable supporting higher gross debt levels given the low yields.     

I don’t really know.  Would it surprise me if corporate debt issuance averaged out to low single digit growth over the next few years or even dipped negative?  Not really.  But I basically think that getting hung up on cyclical issuance trends is a good way to needlessly scare yourself out of what, in the grand scheme of things, is a durable, competitively advantaged business that should, through GDP growth and pricing, grow mid/high-single digits over the next 5-10 years.  I get that it can sometimes feel like predicting and then trading around issuance year-to-year is key to doing well in this stock – a disproportionate number of sell-side questions are dedicated to this fruitless task – but you may be better off just staying put so long as the competitive strengths and growth drivers are intact and the valuation is reasonable.  MIS reported flat or negative growth in corporate finance revenue in half of the 6 years leading up to 2019, yet Moody’s stock still compounded by 23%/year ex. dividends. 

Also, as important as investment grade and high yield issuance is, it accounts for just 30% of MIS’ revenue.  The other 70% comes from bank loans, structured finance, financial institutions, and infrastructure, where revenue is flat ytd vs. a year ago.  Furthermore, MIS is not even the whole story.  The company gets close to 30% of its EBITDA from Moody’s Analytics (MA), a 10%-11% organic grower with mid-90s retention rates and 90% recurring revenue consisting of two business lines:

Research, Data, and Analytics (RD&A), which sells to asset managers and banks the research that Moody’s credit analysts have put together to substantiate MIS ratings[<sup>8</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/spgi_mco/#easy-footnote-bottom-8-22961); and Enterprise Risk Solutions (ERS), which sells software that banks and insurance companies use to stress test their balance sheets, set loan provisions, and stay in compliance with regulations. 

Over the last 3 years, management transformed Analytics through several huge data acquisitions, starting with its 2017 €3bn purchase of Bureau van Dijk, which owns one of the broadest, most comprehensive databases on private companies (Moody’s spent 3x more on BvD than all its previous acquisitions in the prior decade put together).  At the time, I was somewhat critical of Moody’s for paying 23x EBITDA for BvD when it could have repurchased its own stock at 14x, but the acquisition may prove a superior use of capital after all.  Moody’s has done an excellent job cross selling BvD to its non-European bank customers.  Under Moody’s ownership, BvD has seen its revenue growth accelerate from 9%/year to around mid-teens, while its EBITDA margins have inflated from 44% to 52%. 

BvD was followed by acquisitions of REIS ($225mn), which has detailed information on just about every commercial property in the US, and Regulatory Data Corp ($700mn), which owns a proprietary database of 11mn “risk-relevant” people, with data drawn from over 120k different sources.  And with banks voluntarily feeding their own data in return for benchmark statistics, Moody’s already has among the most robust default statistics on commercial loans and corporate credit.  After kind of chugging along as a decent but unspectacular adjacency to MIS, Moody’s Analytics has evolved into a more complete, “one-stop-shop” risk management application for banks.       

Outside the benchmarking segments – Ratings, Indices, and Platts – that comprise 80%+ of its profits, S&P Global also has a data/analytics business, Market Intelligence, that houses Capital IQ (a direct competitor to FactSet) and SNL (like FactSet, but with data specific to banks)[<sup>9</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/spgi_mco/#easy-footnote-bottom-9-22961) [<sup>10</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/spgi_mco/#easy-footnote-bottom-10-22961).  MI is somewhat thematically inconsistent with S&P’s standards-based businesses and generates far lower margins, but performs relatively well vs. competitors, its 6%-8% organic growth is significantly higher than that of FactSet (~4%) and Refinitiv (~3%). 

_(Aside: S&P Global has its origins in a publisher called McGraw-Hill Companies, a name harkening back to the merger between the book departments of publishers founded by James H. McGraw and John A. Hill in the early 1900s (per [this corporate history](https://web.archive.org/web/20070505102210/http:/www.mcgraw-hill.com/aboutus/history.shtml)).  In 2000, nearly 60% of the McGraw-Hill’s profits came from textbooks for K-12 education; reference guides for doctors; magazines, databases, and directories for the aviation, construction, and energy industries; BusinessWeek magazine; and some TV stations.  Under pressure from activist investor JANA Partners, McGraw sold the flagging Education business to Apollo in 2013 for $2.4bn (leading up to the sale, McGraw-Hill Education’s K-12 segment had seen 2 consecutive years of revenue decline.  Growth in the higher ed / professional segment decelerated to ~1%).  Most of the other stuff – including consumer survey company J.D. Power, which S&P acquired in 2005, and a small equity research business – was divested over several years, the proceeds recycled into share repurchases.  Left behind were the faster growing financials businesses…bond ratings, indices, and financial data)._

Data assets create better software products.  Moody’s integrates private company data from BvD and people data from RDC to help banks comply with Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirements.  I estimate that BvD and RDC combined does around $420mn in revenue (~1/4 of Moody’s Analytics), ~$150mn of which is KYC revenue (vs. an estimated TAM of $1bn) that management expects will double over the next 3 years as banks replace their internal manual KYC process with automated outsourced solutions. 

With recently acquired ESG data, Market Intelligence clients can see exposures that various companies have to climate perils.  A portfolio manager might estimate the damage that hurricanes and typhoons could inflict on the companies he covers.  At least one state insurance department is combining data from Trucost, an aggregator of emissions data and carbon metrics that S&P acquired in 2016, with data from SNL to evaluate the impact of climate change on insurers. 

Likewise, bank risk managers might feed REIS’ commercial real estate data and Moody’s C&I default data into ERS’ credit models to project loan defaults under different economic conditions.  They could conceivably overlay environmental data on commercial property data to model stress test losses in more exacting ways. 

But also, S&P and Moody’s data/analytics businesses feed back into ratings and indices.  Just as Moody’s Analytics monetizes the research that informs MIS’ credit ratings through its RD&A sub-segment, Market Intelligence monetizes ratings research through S&P RatingsDirect. The credit scores and quantitative models used to justify bond ratings are also distributed through Capital IQ.

ESG is a special case of cross-pollination[<sup>11</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/spgi_mco/#easy-footnote-bottom-11-22961). Moody’s, S&P, [[MSCI]], and other IP incumbents have been furiously acquiring ESG data/score providers, each trying to own the ESG IP that the landscape of asset managers and bond issuers eventually reference against[<sup>12</sup>](https://www.scuttleblurb.com/spgi_mco/#easy-footnote-bottom-12-22961).  

That Trucost was acquired by SPGI’s Indices segment even though its data is monetized through Market Intelligence reinforces the point I made earlier that almost any “theme” that captivates investors’ imaginations can be crystallized into benchmarks and ETFs.  In 2019, S&P Global acquired the ESG ratings business of RobecoSAM, which provides sustainability scores for more than 7k companies based on 20 years of data.  These scores and the data backing them, in addition to being monetized directly in Market Intelligence, also informed the creation of the S&P ESG Index (an ESG friendly version of the S&P 500), which UBS and State Street have turned into an ETF and which CBOE launched options trading for. 

ESG data and benchmarks are fragmented but will consolidate until a critical mass of the most valuable IP is in incumbent hands, at which point the asset managers who need new products; credit issuers who need low-cost, tax advantaged capital; and the incumbents who own the IP to make this stuff a reality will together push to drive industry-wide adoption, with trillions in assets and debt issuance ride on a several key benchmarks.  As more companies pay Moody’s and S&P to have ESG scores posted alongside their credit ratings, others will be pressured to do the same.    

Anyway, to return to the earlier point, if one’s bearish posture toward Moody’s hinges on pull-forward fears, keep in mind that: 1/ the issuance surge is relegated to investment grade and high yield and even there, given the refinancing pipeline and favorable rate environment, it’s not obvious that issuance has pulled forward to the extent that we should expect a dramatic reversal (fwiw, S&P forecasts a 3% decline in global issuance in 2021); and 2/ Moody’s Analytics is growing by 8%-10% and finally demonstrating organic margin expansion.  If we assume that revenue from IG and HY, which has surged by 77% ytd, declines by 50% the following year and ignore organic growth and margin expansion in the other 80% of Moody’s, per share earnings decline by maybe $1.75 and instead of trading at 27x earnings, Moody’s trades at 32x.  I still think 32x is an attractive valuation in the current environment, considering the durability of Moody’s moat and its through-the-cycle low-double digit earnings growth prospects.

S&P Global doesn’t break out its Ratings revenue with anywhere near the same granularity, but given the how close its ytd Ratings growth is to Moody’s, I assume issuance mix is very similar, in which case a 50% decline in HY and IG revenue would put SPGI’s valuation at a similar low-30x earnings.  And that ignores incremental growth from Indices, a standards-based oligopoly whose double-digit organic growth is fueled by price hikes on subscription revenue and secular ETF demand, as well as from Platts and Market Intelligence, which may not be as attractive as Ratings and Indices – data businesses like Capital IQ, Refinitiv, and FactSet are more resource intensive than I think folks realize since new content and technology must be regularly acquired or built from scratch just to stay competitive, which isn’t true of benchmark businesses like ratings and indices to nearly the same degree – but are like, you know, complementary mid/high-single digit growers that you don’t mind having around.
