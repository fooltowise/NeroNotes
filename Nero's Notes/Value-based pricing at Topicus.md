### Ben, can you share some context to when you first joined TSS and your role and responsibilities?

I joined TSS in 2015. I joined with PharmaPartners, which was one of TSS’s first companies and, at that time, it was run by Han Knooren, who is one of the group CEOs. A few months before I joined, TSS had been acquired by CSI, so it was going through the first round of actually sharing best practices and I jumped straight into it, directly into all CSI’s courses. I was responsible for the sales and marketing, within PharmaPartners, to start with, for my first few years at TSS.

### Can you explain PharmaPartners’ business?

PharmaPartners is a Dutch-based company and is only in the Netherlands. It makes software for GPs and pharmacists. For the pharmacists, they are the biggest in the Netherlands and they make all the healthcare patient records, to ensure you can retrieve your medicines at the pharmacy. It also enables the general practice to understand who you are and what your health looks like. They can do a health check with the software and give you an opinion.

### Is it all software as a service?

It’s all software as a service. As a GP, you would pay between €1,000 and €6,000 a year; for the pharmacists it would be between €10,000 and €15,000 a year. The company itself runs on the pharmacist software so they are really into the DNA of their customers.

### So it stores the patient record information but also the merchandise or inventory at the pharmacy, as well?

Yes; when you walk into the pharmacist, they first have to open the screen to determine who you are and then your personal information pops up. They will also see the specific medicines and where they are stocked but also what they need to prepare. They will also know what order items you had, what your health looks like and the prescription is run, digitally, to the pharmacist, so they are all connected with each other and that makes it pretty unique.

### Who are the competitors in this industry?

Within pharmacies, at the beginning, you had three, including a very small one that just had a few customers. There was CGM, which is a very big one; I think it is a German company. They also do a lot of other stuff but they were the biggest competitor. Then there was a new one, coming up in the market, that we knew of and, I think, that started at some point in 2017. That was pretty unique because there had not been a new competitor for the previous years, in that specific industry. So for the pharmacies, there were three competitors.

With the GPs, there were a few more; I think about four or five. The market was bigger. There were around 2,000 pharmacists in the Netherlands, so you know your market and that’s your main market and that also makes it very specific because you truly understand your customer and it’s very solid. You have a good overview and you know them personally. You also know the employees that are working there. If you look at the market itself, especially within the pharmacists in the Netherlands, out of the 2,000, around 1,200 of those pharmacists belonged to a multi-national. You have got BENU and Alliance Healthcare which is a big one, that is also in the US and England. They had a couple of hundred pharmacists.

### They were the buyer of the software?

Yes.

### You had the relationship with the big multi-national and they procured the software for those pharmacists?

Yes, that is correct. Let’s say that is around 60% of the market and then the other 40% of the market were entrepreneurs with one, two or maybe three pharmacies. They could make their own decisions.

### Are customers on long-term or short-term contracts?

In the beginning, when I started, everything was on a yearly renewal. Changing that was one of the things that we did and we made sure it went to a longer-term contract to lock the market. This will help if a new competitor comes into the market and, especially in vertical market software and the specific industries, such as healthcare, your customer today does not want to leave you because it’s their core system and they want to make sure that it’s up and running. They will also give you some time to restore confidence if something is not going very well, in terms of the software. At that time, a lot of customers were very, very unhappy and, when I started in 2015, that had already been going on for some time. A lot of them said that they were going to leave but they also knew that the other competitors did not have the software that they were looking for. Out of three others, with less good software, the question is, who are you going to choose and is it worth moving to a different software. That’s what actually bought us some time to improve our services, our customer relationship and our software to bring it up to speed to the needs that our customers had.

### What do you think is the biggest risk to TSS’s VMS businesses? Given that they are quite mature software businesses, in the public or healthcare sector, what could be a major competitive risk?

A major competitive risk is that we, as a consumer, always expect the most beautiful software. As a business, you don’t always want that because you want to have a secure software, especially in healthcare. For example, there are some software companies – even PharmaPartners – that were still using COBOL, which is an outdated software language and is not being used anymore. It is difficult to find expertise on that software. So the question is, how can you maintain that software whilst also making sure that you put innovation into it. If the software company has already been around for 40 years, and they had 50 developers working on it, on a day-to-day basis, then you are talking about 2,000 years of software development that you have to replace. That is almost impossible.

### So some of this software is written using very old languages?

Yes, it is. So how do you find a way to still make it innovative and put new languages next to them? Going forward, how can you make sure that you still keep adding value to your customers? The worst thing you can do is to rewrite your own software, which is already good. That is a big challenge. That is one specific internal aspect.

The external aspect is, of course, which software is still truly vertical market software, from the software that you offer? We have had Google, [[Microsoft]] and other more horizontal software, that are taking parts of the services that you have been providing. As an example, the GP needs to know the times and dates when people are going to their office, for a 10-minute appointment. Google can also help you with that. The calendar functionality that you had in your vertical market software suddenly has a competitor.

Then the question is, how big is your vertical market software and is it still truly into the customer’s DNA? If it is not, then there is an opportunity that it will be run over by companies like Google. That is always the challenge that you have to be aware of.

### Is that really a major risk given, as you said, that PharmaPartners effectively runs the operating system for pharmacists and GPs and all the electronic health records?

If you look at the pharmacists, there are a few threats. For example, the multi-nationals have multiple countries, they have their own software development teams, somewhere in the US or London, if you look at Alliance Healthcare. They are building blocks on top of the patient information. At the end of the day, they need to understand the patient information.

PharmaPartners will probably always be there, but the question is, are you a commodity or are you the added value? That is constantly a challenge. Most multi-nationals can actually build their own added value and some of them are doing that. How can you compete with that if they have a worldwide team? If you also look to the new applications, apps are popping up. If an app can actually take the patient information out of the commodity, then for your core business, as PharmaPartners, where before you were running the ERP – the front end – now you are suddenly the back end, the infrastructure. There is no money in infrastructure – at least not at scale – within vertical market software.

### Do you think that is a material risk for some of TSS’s businesses?

It could be, if they don’t manage it properly, going forward. They have to be very aware of what they are going to do and which information are we going to provide as open source, and which are we going to keep in a closed system? Then you always have a challenge with customers saying, everything is open source so why do you not connect with everything? But if you start connecting with everything, then your golden egg is suddenly not that gold anymore.

### For those multi-nationals – the Alliances of the world, the big customers that effectively buy the software for hundreds of pharmacies – do you have good relationships with them as TSS, or are they reluctant to spend the money on the software?

They want to have a relationship with TSS. But there are also, suddenly, governments involved. Within the Netherlands, it is regulated that you need to have a specific level of software system before you can actually have electronic patient information stored there. That is a benefit but that means that all those multi-nationals need to cooperate with TSS and the big ones were doing deals with TSS. I closed one of TSS’s biggest deals, at least in 2015. They wanted to have TSS’s signature behind it, just to make sure that they were able to run their businesses, as it was so vital to the whole organization. They also wanted to innovate on the platform. For that, you need to have a very good relationship with your customer.

### It is almost as if PharmaPartners has the golden egg which is the position in the technology stack of the data, the electronic health records and they need to keep on adding value around that, to protect it?

Correct; that is indeed what they are doing. They are also looking to the value chain. Before, the value chain was just the pharmacists, as a silo, and then you had the GPs as a silo. But the value chain is now also with the customer. How can you make sure that the customer – thinking about what we saw with Covid – is able to communicate with the GP and the pharmacist, in a digital way, with all the security information that they need. Presenting medicines to the customer is pretty dangerous, on one side, because they sometimes do not understand what is in there. They also do not see the risks of the multiple medicines that they have. How do you make sure that the information about the medicine is also presented to the customer, in a secured way, and that the information was correct? They also need to understand there are risks if you have to buy another over-the-counter medicine that may have a conflict with your current medication. That was the next big thing that we needed to solve.

### What was wrong at PharmaPartners, when you joined?

There were a few things. One thing was that there had been no innovation for the last five years, at least in the customer’s eyes. Another issue was, if you were a GP, and in the Netherlands, every 10 minutes, you have a different patient and the software was not working. There could be someone sitting next to you, with a crying child who was sick, but you couldn’t open the software, so you didn’t have a clue, as a GP, about what was going on with that child. You then had to call PharmaPartners, but there was a waiting time of 30 minutes. But in 30 minutes, you would normally have three different consultations. That was wrong.

Those customers were so unsatisfied; the software was not working and not doing what it should do. It was a classic car, but classic cars need to be repaired. There was no service and everything that the customer was promised was never met. They were very angry customers. The first meeting I had, after I joined, was one where there were around 200 to 250 customers and they were so angry. It was like standing in front of an angry mob.

### Was that from one multi-national that purchased all those customers or were they all individual entrepreneur customers that had come together to complain?

It was a combination of individuals and the big multi-nationals.

### Was that due to under-investment in the technology by management, over the years, not innovating the product?

Maybe they did invest, but they invested in the wrong places. There was also a very high cycle of changes in the company itself. But they also had some key positions that they were filling with temporary employees. For a temporary employee, the business case is, how do I make sure that I can be here for longer? Their business case is not to help you with your business but to say, how can I get another assignment? That does not help. There were just a few pillars that were not working correctly, such as customer support, the instability of the software, promises not met and there was a cash burn.

### Do you think that is just the company getting lazy within a bigger holding company structure?

That was before my time because I joined when we decided to do something different.

### Didn’t TSS buy PharmaPartners in 2011, so they had owned it for four years before you joined?

Correct. I think, in 2012, 2013, TSS already made an intervention. They put in a new director but he was not able to repair the issues. Then they did another intervention, in 2015, and a lot of small ones in between, I expect, with CSI’s new knowledge. Han Knooren went on board and created his new team, who were already people that were working there, but they just had a different mindset. He gave them a podium and then we started to work.

### So what did you do?

I think we did everything. We had a massive plan, that we called the PharmaPartner’s Turnaround. How can we change the company in six months? We did it all. The first thing we did was to start with customer support and the women on the phone calls. They were sitting there and they knew that if they hung up with a customer and picked up a new call, that customer had already been waiting for 30 minutes, so the first five minutes was just people shouting at them. We started there. We didn’t put additional resources there. We made them the most important value asset of the company and that was life-changing.

What did we actually do, physically? Physically, we were sitting next to them and if we, as a management team, saw that the lead time and waiting time was going up, we would walk into the room, take a seat next to them and we would talk to the customers ourselves. Suddenly there was this drive of, we can get this done. In a few months, the waiting time went from 30 minutes, to 20, to 12, to eight, to six to three. That was just in three or four months. We didn’t add new people; we just changed the mindset. We told them they were the most important thing, so let’s do it together and just get it done. That was the most important item.

### Were these customers telling you that they pretty much wanted to leave? You said you typically have months, if not a year, to prove to the customer that you can turn this around for them. Is that how the contracts work?

It was a yearly renewal, so they could step out at each renewal point. It was not only the customers, but it was also the employees who wanted to leave; they were sick, at home, not wanting to come in. If your employees are not willing to come to the office, then suddenly your customers don’t want to be involved.

### Did you lose many customers?

Not that many. As of 2015, we were still growing. But luckily, our competitors were doing even worse. They also had waiting times of 20 minutes and their software had also not been innovated, it had bugs in it and had bad performance. The question is, at that moment in time, is the grass truly greener with the competitor, or not?

### Before we get onto the other things that you changed, in these markets, given that the sectors are quite mature and there are only a few players, there is a set number of pharmacies and GPs in the country, is growth really based on increasing the revenue per customer, rather than growing the number of customers, at this point in the industry?

We did both. From a new business perspective, there was definitely growth. For the GP's market share was still growing. So it was both. It was also getting paid for the added value that you were putting into your software.

### After changing the customer service, what did you do next?

We fixed the leadership. That was actually our first target point. We focused on the people. We knew we had these customers who would yell at us; it didn’t matter what we were going to do, we would have that conversation. Against all odds, we did quite a lot. We did value-based pricing. Customers were saying, why are you increasing your prices because you are giving a shitty service? We said, that is correct. But we are giving shitty service because of the prices, so we need to increase them. We managed to do that, in that period of time.

### This was within the six months? You had people complaining and lining up, but you also increased your price?

Yes.

### How did you look to roll out value-based pricing?

With the GPs, the pricing metrics that were used back then was that you paid per amount of patients that you had. We changed the methodology to calculate that. In the Netherlands, there are two numbers. As one FTE GP, you can have around patients. But in the contract with PharmaPartners, it still stated that it was around 2,700. We decreased that number to closer to 2,350 and that was what the price was calculated on, so that would give us an instant pricing increase, just by changing that calculation number. We told all the GPs, listen, this is what your organization says, that you can have 2350 patients. Our contract states you can have more so we are going to use the number from your organization, because these are your numbers.

### Was that 2,700 number from older contracts, 20 years ago?

Yes; it was a fixed number in the PharmaPartners’ contracts, but it was not indexed, based on the industry number. That was the first thing. The other thing was, with the pharmacists, there was a change in the contracts, due to the fact that more and more were automated processes. If you get a day-to-day medicine, normally, that would be one point for PharmaPartners every day, but then they changed the rules and it was only 0.3 points. That’s also why we changed with the explanation as to why we had done it.

The biggest thing was that we changed the prices and we also gave our customers our promises. We were going to continue relying on customer communication, so we gave them a checklist. We said, this is what we are going to do, for a full year, and we will promise that we will tick every box. They were very smart, specific goals. For example, lowering the waiting time from 30 minutes to less than 10; having a higher performance. We told them we were going to do that and, on a monthly basis, we will communicate the progress with you. With the big ones, we were going to evaluate it every quarter.

In order for us to enter into this plan, they needed to do value-based pricing because otherwise, we couldn’t invest in the improvements that we were going to make. By the end of the year, we had ticked all the boxes. That also helped with the price change that was implemented month over month. We started measuring in January; some conversations with unhappy customers were in March or April. Every month, we had a new metric to show them, as you can see, it is improving. That was very helpful.

Another thing that I did, and I think it was hilarious, was I thought, who was is actually in pain in the pharmacy? It is not the pharmacist themselves; it is the other people that are behind the counter. We sent out a book, with our promises, to every pharmacist and we put a big candy bar next to it; a big pot with lots of small candies in it. I made a promise and said, we are going to do this, this and this, by the middle of the year, by the summer. If we didn’t deliver and you still have long waiting times – you can eat away the waiting time – either myself or the CEO will come to your office and we will make sure that there is new candy in the jar.

We sent it to all of the pharmacies. My question to you would be, how often do you think we had to go to a pharmacist?

### Zero.

We had three. Before we did it, everyone said, there will be 50 or 100, or 200. A minimum of 50 and you will have to go to all of those customers. But then that would have meant we did not do a good job, if that was the case. By sending that jar to all the pharmacists, we were actually telling the ladies behind the counter – who we didn’t normally communicate with very well, because it was always the pharmacist – hey, we understand your pain and we are working on it. This is my promise, and I will come to you, if it is needed. We only had three, at some time in June, of which two just liked the idea and wanted to test us and were already very happy at that time. That mindset, that message, was key. Shouting out to your customers, this is a promise and this is what we will do if we can’t keep the promise or you are still having long waiting times.

### Do TSS always adapt the price for the companies that they acquire, to follow the value-based pricing approach?

They did it at the beginning. In 2015 and 2016, they did it with almost every company. But now, it still happens often, but it is not an obligation anymore. They now already have best practices in value-based pricing, which because of the storytelling that is now happening, new companies actually want to do it, because they think it’s fun. It’s enjoyable, it’s good for business, it’s good for the customer, so let’s do it.

### But there is also this interesting thing where, maybe, all of these entrepreneur-run companies, that are not acquired by CSI or TSS, are actually massively underpricing their products.

Yes, they are. I think every software company that is providing value is doing that. A lot of software companies, in their contract, in small print, they say okay, we can change the price at the indexation rate. Indexation is maybe 1% or 2%. But they are building newer software, with more added value and that added value is actually worth money to the customer. If you do not charge them for that added value, for the new functionality into the ERP system, then you are actually giving them a present. I truly believe that most of the VMS companies are underpriced.

### Do you have to be mission-critical software to be able to keep increasing the price?

I think you have to add value in a specific process to increase your price. As long as you can add value, to solve a problem, make a business case around the problem and put it in financials or an hours’ less work, you can always add value to your own company.

### Going back to the calendar example, let’s say PharmaPartners has the electronic health records and the ERP for the pharmacist, you might add value and add a calendar or a chat box, but if that’s not really your core value add or expertise, there is always going to be a better calendar or a better chat box, potentially. Does that not add risk into the business, where you might be spending money and developing innovation on a functionality that doesn’t actually add value, in the long run?

The question is, where do you need to innovate? You need to innovate around your core data. If you take a calendar, I would never build a calendar because Google is better at it. But if you can make a calendar that has information on medicines in it, for example, and also pushes it, in a secured way, to both pharmacists, the GPs, the customer and maybe someone else such as people who may have help at home and they need to know about it, then suddenly, it becomes a healthcare program calendar, as opposed to just a calendar. Yes, you can only add value as long as there is a golden egg in the software.

### What do you think is the most misunderstood part of value-based pricing, for VMS businesses?

A lot of people see it as a price increase but a lot of software companies are also misusing it as a price increase. A lot of companies are afraid of it and it all comes back to your storyline. If you have a specific storyline, then it’s not scary and it is actually healthy for the customer and healthy for yourself. Suddenly, by having that discussion with the customer, it’s not about the price increase but it’s about, do we both agree that we deliver specific value? Is that value on the specific items? If the answer is yes, there is a certain value in financial reward for that. That is the outcome.

Am I helping your customer to understand that you are still providing value, because they have already been your customer for 20 years? At one point, they are going to look at PharmaPartners and say, what is the value that they are providing me, because there are so many other systems that can also almost do the same. Between almost and 100%, there is your value and that is what you want to talk to them about.

### It is almost like aligning yourself with the customer first, clearly communicating what you think you are doing in adding value and then getting aligned with that, committing to that and then that can warrant the price increase?

Exactly.

### How do you keep growing recurring revenue, over time?

That is the most difficult issue. To do it year over year, it means that, as a software company, you need to understand a specific cycle, within your company, that can move faster. At PharmaPartners, they have maybe only two or three releases per year, on new software. How can you make sure that there is a cycle next to it that is actually providing added value, with innovative software? That’s difficult.

What we did is, we called it a SIG, a special interest group. We went to our customers and we said to them, these are our wishes; what are your wishes? If I ask you the 10 things that you want, you want 100. The question is, not what you want, but where do you see failure for your company that you are willing to pay money for? That is the first meeting that you have.

Then you are going to ask them to put their money where their mouth is. You calculate that this innovation is costing us €100,000, as an example. For the pharmacists we said, if you can find 100 pharmacists that are willing to put €500 or €1,000 to a commitment that they are going to use it for a specific license fee in the future, then we are going to build it. You have to have the commitment up front, you have a down payment and so they are connected to you. You always have to ask for a financial return because then there is a contract. Then you start building it, inviting the customers so that they can also help you to create the software module, share specific items in-depth, with your other customers and then start implementing the MVP, the minimum viable product.

We did it so you could only see your medicines; you couldn’t order them, because that would be the next step. You make them very smart and small and you don’t start building a car; you start with a small bicycle, then a bigger bicycle, then an electric bicycle, a moped and so on.

Every time, there should be a deliverable and that has to be done fast. The definition of fast is, in a proper way that you have committed to your customers, in the software cycle that you have.

### How did you price those new features?

It was difficult; that is always a challenge. I did quite a lot of price module calculations. The best thing is, because you have the early adopters group, you give them a specific fee which you know will be a massive discount for them. You do not set the business module yet. You just say to them, okay, we are going to make sure that other people are going to pay more than you. But if the outcome is that they are going to pay less than you, because we can’t sell it, you will also get a discount.

Firstly, you want to understand what it is in the software that is generating the value. You want to have a baseline and then you want to try to generate a price module on top of the times that the value is generated. It can be a click; it could be a download of electronic patient file; it could be the amount of medicines that have been ordered, because there is direct value.

### Is it always variable?

No. There is always the risk, if a competitor comes in, and it’s not really solid, then you go to zero. There should always be a baseline but it’s nice to have a variable on top of that because that could be your year over year growth. When you add more customers, you can add them faster because the starting fee is less and if they are going to start using it more and more, then you will grow with them. The most important thing is, if you see that the variable is growing, then you also understand that the software is being used. If you do not see that, even if you grow to 500 customers in two or three years, it can suddenly break down to zero if they see that they are also paying for something that they never use, and just take it out of the contract. You need to have the measurements in it.

Now we are talking about contracts. Another thing that I did was that we made building blocks of the contracts. If you are a customer with a five-year contract, in two years, I would make a new contract with you, for a new part of the software, but that would not have the same end date as your original one; it would be either a shorter period of time, so for one or one and a half years, or it would be for another five years. If we have two or three contracts and those contracts all have a different end date, then I know, as a company, that if you are not going say goodbye to the first small contract, I know you will also be there for the big one, and vice versa. My risk of losing you is much lower because it is costing you, as a customer, more money to step out of one contract but still have to pay for two.

We called them building blocks, like building a house. If you put on more layers then you have an endless customer, because they can never leave because the cost of leaving is so high, it is no longer interesting for them to leave.

### Because they just have different contracts for different parts of the software solution?

Yes, and of different durations. The duration is actually the most important.

### What could go wrong with value-based pricing?

The question is, does it matter if a customer leaves with value-based pricing? If you can increase your prices by 20% and 10% of your customers are leaving, then you still have a 10% price increase. Probably, those 10% are customers that you truly do not want, so you have got rid of them. There are two sides to that story.

### Going back to the point on the building blocks, let’s say I’m a pharmacist with PharmaPartners, I have a standard contract with you, for five years. I signed it in 2015 with you and there is a price increase. What do you suggest when you come back to me in 2017?

I suggest multiple modules. Maybe initially we only provided the software for the pharmacist but now, let’s provide the software for your customer; an app for your customer to communicate with you, for which the contract will have a different duration.

Another thing is that I would sell you recurring professional services. What that means is that, as a pharmacist or as a customer, if something is not working, I will firstly call PharmaPartners, but it could also be your network. It could be your hardware, your software, your Wi-Fi, your printer, so there are lots of different IT partners. I actually came up with a module that says, you will have only one single point of contact, at PharmaPartners, and we will make sure that we will align with your other software suppliers, to solve your problem, no matter what it is, whether it’s your VPN, your firewall or so on.

You ring up as a customer that has a bug or something not working, but PharmaPartners says it is not the software and the IT partner says, it’s also not the hardware. The question is, where do you have to go. Then you get added value and then you get a partnership. So that is also an important factor, selling better services as well as more software.

### What percentage of revenue, roughly, was professional services? I think it’s quite high for TSS, in the recent report. I think it’s over 20% or 25% of revenue?

PharmaPartners was always around 90% to 95% SaaS, so it was a small part.

### So there are other parts of TSS that must have higher professional service revenue?

Yes; there is one company called Yonder and that is 100% a professional services company, so that will have a big impact. Also, some software companies have implementations of €300, €400, €500. The big-ticket markets are more professional services.

### You can actually turn those professional services revenue into more recurring revenue, if you partner with a customer?

Yes. If you look at the products you are delivering and question what the services are that you are now calling professional services, there can also be a service level agreement. Where there are financial holes, there is a possibility of stripping down your professional services to make it into your service level agreement, which will be recurring revenue.

### How profitable is that professional service revenue, if you make it recurring? You still have to serve the customer, so you need manpower.

That’s true. If you look at recurring PS on the service level agreement, there are two things. Firstly, to have it recurring, you should always have an obligation, as a company, to actually fulfil it. At one point in the future, you as a customer, will lose the benefit of that specific service. That means that if you have those contracts, then you can either be reactive or proactive, and you can plan it in the way you want to do it. If you look more towards professional service businesses, there is always issues with demand, so you are either overfull, with too many people, having a lower ratio or you have a shortage because you are all over the place and then you cannot help anyone.

If you know, up front, that you can do a specific amount of services, you can plan for the full year and you will also know how much of the resources you will need.

### So it’s half professional services, half software?

It depends on what you are doing but, yes, it definitely is. Also, your customer service desk can do a lot of those services. A traditional service desk is inbound but why not set up an outbound team and do more on customer success? Call the customer if they want to have a specific service so you are ahead of the question.

### I’ve got one last question on organic growth because I do want to touch on M&A. What do you think is really the biggest risk to TSS, for organic growth?

Are you able to innovate? I think the market really depends on that. Are you in a shrinking or a growing market?

### That’s the question. Take PharmaPartners, for example. How fast is that end market growing? How much can you continually add on features, before you max out? How much can they really afford to pay for software?

If you look at the pharmacists and GPs, one thing that PharmaPartners did was to make the app for the people to communicate with the GPs and pharmacists. Suddenly, there is a new market of 15 million people. That’s the first thing; extend your value proposition.

Another item is that, at one point, I made an overview of the total expenses of a pharmacist. We determined, can those expenses move from the purchase of paper to us, if we make that specific process digital? Based on the analytics, what we did was looked at the large amount of paperwork that the pharmacists have to do in the Netherlands and we made it digital. Every item that used to be done via paper, was now being processed digitally, by PharmaPartners.

The business case was, how many euros are you not spending on paper, and what can be our added value on top of that? It’s expanding your territory within your local market.

### Really, it’s just execution and culture and you have to be able to keep on having that mindset to add value to the customer?

Yes; keep on doing it. Keep on thinking out of the box. With this paperless example, at one point, we said, how are we going to sell it. The pharmacist is locally based and is always in the village, in the neighborhood, so let’s calculate, for each pharmacist, how many trees they are burning a year. If they move over to this eco way of communication, we will double that amount of trees and try to plant them in the pharmacist’s neighborhood.

Brilliant idea and I think that they are now executing it and I understand, from a colleague, that they have built a massive tree at an expo and presented this idea as a way of getting people in, with the green footprint. That kind of mindset is great.

### Ben, I’d like to talk about M&A. How were you involved in making acquisitions at TSS?

Within PharmaPartners I tried to do some acquisition myself, together with my colleague. We went to companies that we felt we could buy, within the PharmaPartners environment. We had some conversations with business owners and then I did some coaching. Later, at the end of 2019, I coached the whole M&A team for Europe. I didn’t actually have any M&A experience but I had the TSS experience and the mindset about everything I just told you about customers and other things and how you can do that within M&A.

### How can you do that within M&A?

The question is, what are you selling? Are you selling to buy a company? I called it the unexpected phone call. I think the best thing that can happen to you, as an M&A person – because they are long cycles – is to have an unexpected phone call from someone that says, let’s have a cup of coffee, because of everything you did before. I don’t think that you are selling the value that you want to give to a company when you want to buy it. I think you should always sell the value that is there. It’s just a product.

TSS has a very specific and unique selling point on how they want to conquer Europe and that is by sustaining software companies, to the end of time, and let the customers and employees of that specific company grow, to have a healthy company and a healthy financial result. That’s the result of everything that TSS is doing. You should sell everything that TSS is doing because that is something that you, as a company owner, can actually benefit from.

### How do you explain that to a 65-year-old entrepreneur?

The easiest way to explain it is to put them in contact with someone who has already done it, so they can share their story with them. It’s all about storytelling. The other thing is, there is prep work that you have to do, which is to dig into the mindset of the 65-year-old entrepreneur. Who is he? What is his family life? What does he think is important? Try to find out as much as possible, before you contact him, because then you can talk about his values and what he thinks is important in life. That could be, for example, to have a legacy, to make sure that his son-in-law can work within the company, but can never own the company; that the coffee lady who has been working with him for 40 years can still work there for the next 20 years. If you understand that is what drives them, that is the target you are going to have with that person. You can tell them some examples of where the coffee lady was still working within TSS for the next 20 years; that is what that 65-year-old entrepreneur would like to hear.

### What about the price?

It is irrelevant. The price is always irrelevant, I think, with today’s mindset and culture. If it was pre-2008, yes, it was all about price and the big money. But nowadays, with the social environment and your social responsibility to your neighbors, at the end of the day, it does not matter to an entrepreneur if he is going to get 20 million or 22 million, or 100 million or 105 million for the company. That is not where the value is, with that specific entrepreneur.

If you’re talking about venture capitalists, then it’s a different story, of course. For the entrepreneur it is all about his value drivers and if he can have a good pension from what he is going to have and maybe also his kids can have a good life, then that’s okay. Then it’s not about the money; it’s about the lady who delivers the coffee.

### Did you see TSS win deals with a much lower price, a lot of the time?

Yes, they did; quite often, actually. You had the opportunity to talk with an entrepreneur who sold his company and one of them was so intrigued by what TSS was doing he said, he wanted to learn about it. Because his driver was to learn about what TSS was doing, he sold it to TSS. A few months ago, I talked with him. He talked about it in a presentation, everything had increased and the business was booming. He said, I am glad I sold it to TSS because now I understand what a fool I was because I didn’t understand how to do this. If I was going to sell it today, it would be worth maybe 10 or 15 times the money that I got from it two years ago. But I was never able to reach that, without TSS. That was his value driver.

That comes back to why does the entrepreneur want to sell. They want to learn; they want to take a pension. Another one wants to have some money and wants to do something else.

### How do you structure the earnout for the founder? Let’s say I sell you my business, for €10 million, do you make me stay with you for a certain period of time? Do I get a salary?

If you stay, you get a salary. If you don’t stay, you don’t stay. Every MD is the same. They all get a salary. They either sold their company or they are grown into position. There is a massive future leadership network program for management development, just to make sure that there are also people growing from employee to manager, manager to managing director, running your own business or multiple businesses. That is what all the investments are in, from TSS’s point of view. So at least in the context that I know, there is no commitment to the founders.

### Is that not a risk? If I built that business for 25 years, you would just buy it and you’re happy to let me, the founder, leave?

I think it depends on a number of factors. If there are five employees, you never let him leave. If there are 100, then it’s a different matter because then you want to have the managers because they will probably know much more than the founder. Also, there could be some KPIs set, where they wanted to stay but TSS did not want to have that specific person. So there is often a big question about who is going to run it. Is the person who is going to sell it actually the correct person for the job?

### How do you look at the financials of the acquisition?

There is what’s called a totals line which is pretty cool. A totals line compares the return on investment to growth. The less growth you have, the higher your return on investment capital has to be. The higher your growth, the less return on investment capital there has to be. They want to hit that specific line within a very short period of time; two to three years, maybe four at the max. Then TSS is very happy. Then you have to stay there, year over year.

### Would they have a hurdle rate for every acquisition, such as 20% or 25% ROIC?

Or higher.

### Then you would say, you have to get 10% growth and that’s it; you have those KPIs?

Yes, that’s the main KPI; return on investment capital of between 20% and 30%. Then you also have to grow it. So it’s always gold plated back to the first year of acquisition.

### When you acquire the business and you go and do your due diligence, do you know, I can increase the price here, I can change the value-based pricing here? You can probably get to that pretty quickly if you look at these relatively older businesses?

Yes, that’s true. There is another method that I think is called the Chicago Formula. When you create a business case, but also with innovation and everything you are going to invest money in, there are four scenarios. There is worst case, best case and everything in between. There will be one generic case, as an outcome. As an example, TSS has taken over the financials and HR, so that is already a massive decrease in overheads. Take out all the pet projects and focus back on the base ideas. They also do explain expectations about price increases, added value, contract renewal and that will be the business case.

### Last question, Ben. I think Topicus now have over 90 businesses. In 10 years’ time, if Topicus hasn’t grown much, what do you think could be the reason for that?

The only reason that this scenario will happen is because TSS was not able to spend the free cash. If they can’t spend it, this is the scenario because this is actually the organic growth scenario. They have a lot of free cash flow so they should invest it based on their core values and core principles. If they step away from those core values and core principles, I believe that is the only risk that they have internally. That means they are getting more opportunist as opposed to more financial.

### There is no reason why they can’t acquire another 100 businesses in Europe, over the next 10 years?

No, not in my opinion. If you look at 2015, when it was acquired by CSI, they started to do all acquisitions in the Netherlands, for the first two years, so they grew rapidly. In 2017, they started to do their first acquisitions in other countries in Europe and now, in 2021, they have 10 in France, that they acquired. It was actually the starting point for TSS, when it was acquired by CSI. It can grow. They now have a pretty good position in the Nordics, with M&A.

From my understanding, they are now moving into the scaleup phase of M&A in Europe. Years before, it was the startup phase but now, if you can have 10 companies in France, they can also have 20 or 25 there. The same applies to the Nordics. They have around eight or 10. If you have 10, you can also have 30. You are over the hurdle. People understand you.

### The cultural hurdle?

The cultural hurdle but also that if you go to a company in the Nordics or in France, you tell them that you own this, this and this company, most likely, they will have already heard of it because it will be a similar company to those that you have already acquired. The snowball effect will keep it moving.

### Ben, maybe one day we’ll see you back at TSS, doing the acquisitions, potentially?

Maybe there will be an opportunity at some point in the future.
