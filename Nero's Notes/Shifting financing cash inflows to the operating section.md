### Recording bogus CFFO from a normal bank borrowing

- A company selling its inventory to a bank and promising to buy it later at a higher price is nothing else than a loan collateralized by the inventory -> this is a financing cash inflow!

- Remember that bogus revenues also means bogus CFFO
  

### Boosting CFFO by selling receivables before the collection date

- Turning receivables into cash even though the customer has yet to pay:
  - this can be called **factoring**: the simple sale of receivables to a third party, often a bank or a special purpose entity
  - this can also be **securitization**: the sale of receivables to a third party(often  a special purpose entity) for the purpose of creating new financial instruments by repackaging the receivables inflows
  - **In any way, both factoring and securitization are financing operation, and the resulting cash flows should be treated as such**. They should never appear in CFFO, but cash flows from financing activities.
- Watch for sudden swings on the statement of cash flows

### Inflating CFFO by faking the sale of receivables

- Watch carefully for disclosure changes in the risk factors. Those risk factors often look like legal boilerplate, *changes* to the disclosures are deemed worthy by the management. Ex: Peregrine disclosing that it was engaging in new customer financing agreements, then later disclosed that some customers were failing to meet their obligation. Then it mentioned that *it may at times market certain client receivable balances without recourse*.
