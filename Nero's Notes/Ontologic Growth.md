# Ontologic Growth

The [[Network Theory and Scale|scaling]] power law of metabolism explains why we stop growing past a certain size.

The number of cells in the body scale proportionally to the weight of the human being (exponent = 1). But its metabolic rate scale with an exponent 3/4. If you double the size of the body, you double the number of cells, but you only multiply by 75% the energy provided to the cells. When we are babies, most of the energy provided is used to create new cells so the body can grow. Very little energy is used to maintain existing cells. But as we grow, the number of cells grows much quicker than the energy provided, until a point where all the energy is used to maintain existing cells; no energy is available to create new cells: this is where we stop growing.
