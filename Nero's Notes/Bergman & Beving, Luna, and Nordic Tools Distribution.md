### Could you share a brief introduction to your background?

My background is mostly with industrial companies. I was in everything from the construction products division at Husqvarna to the Ernström Group, a family-owned industrial conglomerate. I spent time with Hultafors Group, owned by Latour, and I also had a detour in the healthcare sector as the CEO of Aleris. I held leadership positions in several industrial Swedish companies.

### When did you first come into contact with Bergman & Beving?

When I left Husqvarna and started at the Ernström Group, I met someone working at Bergman & Beving who I brought on to an Ernström Group board. He brought the Bergman & Beving handbook with him, which is the philosophy of the group written by one of the owners. That was the way they lived and how they tried to drive the company with a decentralized model, letting people take decisions on their own, within the framework of a clear focus on return on operating capital employed. I worked with him for three years when I was a CEO at Ernström Group, then joined Hultafors Group when Luna was one of their bigger customers. I established that relationship and also tried to buy out ESSVE first, then the whole product part as they were doing a vertical integration and were messing up the business. Our focus at Hultafors Group was to be a supplier of both hard and soft tools for the handyman.

### Who was the guy you met?

Stefan, who spent most of his life at Bergman & Beving.

### He wasn't the CEO?

No, but he had worked for Luna for many years. I came in contact with another person who worked for one of their product companies called Anders Petter, who did cutlery product assortment. When I moved home the first time, I bought a cutlery set distributed by Bergman & Beving, and she was a power lady. This was in the late nineties when women in managerial positions was uncommon, even in Sweden. She may have introduced me to Stefan when I started at the Ernström Group.

### What is so interesting about the handbook?

Have you read it?

### I have read the history of Bergman & Beving. It seems all Swedish companies have a manual as both Addtech and Lifco have one.

Bergman & Beving started this concept which Addtech, Lagercrantz and others emulated. They are borne out of the same philosophy. I had one at Ernström Group which I can send you digitally because I think ours is better today. It is important because, if you run a decentralized model with a broad scope, you need a framework to keep everything together. Your people need a common language and thought model. You have to share a belief in how to drive business which becomes the philosophy that drives the whole business. In addition to values, it covers tools to manage the company.

### When you meet people from Bergman & Beving and even from the product companies, how do they really feel as if they are part of Bergman & Beving? How much do they care about the handbook and values? They are separate companies; they are very decentralized and autonomous.

EBITA / WC is the key matrix everyone tries to optimize beyond 45%. A CEO of a company within the group is very independent, as long as they attain this metric.

### Is that the main metric and do you think it is the right one?

It's one of the most important ones. As we wanted some of our businesses to continue driving acquisitions, we took a broader scope than simply working capital. If you want to make life very simple for the organization at large, it's the right one, but if you want a CEO to drive growth and take broader responsibility for the total capital he engages, it becomes complicated and harder to communicate to everyone. I think if you only dare to have one, maybe that's the right one. Lagercrantz transitioned to owning their products, which meant they needed to also look at their fixed assets, which cannot be ignored in the long run.

### That doesn't include goodwill either?

No, it becomes limited at some level but, for a trading company, it's perfect. Looking at Luna for example, it's a perfect way to measure their efficiency on how they work with their capital because it's mainly working capital in their balance sheet, whereas ESSVE does big capex investments to bring home some manufacturing they have been buying from the Far East. If you don't include it, it's a fair comparison to how you traded before.

### It's good for trading companies who have no big fixed assets.

It's good because it's so clear that everyone knows what is important.

### How did you think of the Hultafors Group distribution when you were CEO?

Hultafors Group was, historically, a tool company with three wholesale clients who distributed to everyone. We ran product development and manufacturing and they did the distribution, which is the general model in Sweden. The world has changed slightly but Luna was one of the main distributors of our products.

### Who were the other two?

It was a group of companies who built a distributor model.

### The same size as Luna?

Yes, but it was on a falling roof. Ahlsell was the other one, but they began to change their business model from being a distributor to setting up their own shops, which is what B&B Tools tried to do. They started with private brands so when I came in, I realized we needed to protect our business because we had no access to end users. We needed to create a pull from the end user so we performed end user studies to decide who our end users were from a persona perspective. It was the professional handyman who always delivers quality and who everyone looks up to. He commands a premium price, arrives and delivers on time, therefore buys our premium products.

We started building a brand story and changed the color of our products. We realized that if we could get this right over time, we would get a premium price and distribution would be more around logistics. That is how we thought about the tool business. We were also in protective wear with Snickers Workwear which had a different distribution model. Here, we sold directly to resellers and big key accounts such as SAS, Aviator and NCC. We made a protective wear program for them with their brand name, and sold everything from branding the clothing to distributing packages to individual workers. There we started to go through ecommerce solutions which established a strong presence with our end users, but 95% of that distribution is still through resellers. Luna was never a distributor of those products but Ahlsell was because they were a reseller.

### Do you mean in protective wear?

It was two different distribution strategies. It is more consolidated in HVAC or components and tools whereas protective wear remains fragmented. That allowed us, as a big brand, to have more power with smaller resellers.

### Did you sell online to the resellers?

We streamlined our supply chain so they bought through our web shop. We bought space in their shops so that 50% was branded Snickers Workwear. We wanted them to get the best discounts with us so that when someone comes in, they can talk better about Snickers Workwear products than others they were trying to sell. We tried to hook them up with events for our end users but we started them too soon. We had flagship stores to show them, if they only stocked their store with our products, this is how it could look. That was also a way for us to experiment selling to end users.

### You can only do that if you have a premium brand?

Yes, it's different. If a handyman needs a pair of trousers which are not on the shelf, they will buy another pair, which is the same with a hammer. The game is about availability, which was our fear because Ahlsell were pushing their own brand. We were competing with B&B Tools, Luna Tools and Hultafors Tools, which is when things started to get messy because everyone was mixing up the value chain. That was Bergman & Beving's biggest mistake. They had the most comprehensive product catalogs for resellers but when they started to integrate forward, everyone switched from Luna and B&B Tools, and with the leadership style of a decentralized organization, they could not execute on it because their model was to buy companies.

### Are resellers in that value chain the handyman or independent wholesalers?

> In Sweden, we use the word grossist which is someone who has a broad product catalog, but it's mostly not their own products. Manufacturing companies give them products and they do the logistics. Sweden used to have independent Iron Shops which were family-owned and wholesalers performed the logistics and consulted on which products would be good to have on their shelves. Resellers started consolidating and many thought they should move their warehouse logistic services in-house. Ahlsell has the best logistics solution in Sweden in construction and industrial distribution. They were Luna customers but built independent shops owned by the Thomée Group.

### Luna used to sell to Ahlsell who disintermediated and built their own store?

> Luna used to supply mom-and-pop shops which Ahlsell started buying out. Bergman & Beving also started buying shops to protect their market, but executed these models very differently. Ahlsell came out the clear winner from the perspective of that integrated distribution model. Today, the main problem is there are few independent resellers to serve Luna and Thomée.

### Who do they sell to? Do handymen go directly to resellers or Luna?

There are still a few independents out there, so if they sell directly, they will be competing with their customers. The main reason they are struggling is because the reseller market has been consolidated. Bolist is a construction material merchant who first built up their own warehouse then realized it was too difficult, so some of them have integrated backwards as a reseller to have a wholesaler function internally. They are still in businesses where some resellers have been unsuccessful with distribution. The building, construction and industry equipment business is a logistical nightmare because there are so many articles. On paper, it's easy to say you will have your own central warehouse as a reseller, but it is complicated to have everything you need to fulfill end user demand because the construction business is non-standardized.

### Today Luna, Ahlsell and Thomée are the three big distributors for tools and consumables in construction?

There is one more owned by a group of resellers who remain independent. When this consolidation started, there was resentment from resellers as to how they would survive if wholesalers like Ahlsell bought them; where would they get their products from? Some big independent resellers formed a common purchase company which has some logistical functions within it. Thomée is Luna's biggest competitor, whereas Ahlsell are running a vertical model and are no longer a wholesale competitor.

### Do they serve end customers like Luna?

Ahlsell definitely serves end customers but that's not Luna's main business.

### Ahlsell serves the resellers like the mom-and-pop shops?

Exactly, and that market has shrunk.

### That market shrunk because Ahlsell, effectively, took them out the market?

Yes, they have been extremely successful at taking them out.

### What can Luna do to improve profitability?

I don't know if Luna still serves the old tools shops after the company split.

### That was my question; do they serve retail?

Yes, but they combined that with Swedol. Luna served the B&B Tools shops while they were part of Bergman & Beving.

### They spun out so maybe they no longer serve them.

They spun out B&B Tools shops and combined them with Swedol, which the Nordstjernan family own. They spun out Momentum Group which is a separate entity more into industrial services. The question I cannot answer is whether B&B Tools and Swedol remain Luna customers, because that's still a sizable customer to have.

### Where else would they go, to Ahlsell?

They would never go to Ahlsell.

### Because they have their own Ahlsell?

They are an Ahlsell competitor, so they would build their own capability.

### Yes, but it's difficult to manage 100,000 SKUs and warehousing. Luna have been struggling for five years; what can they do to improve their profitability?

Luna are looking at an extensive cost-cutting program but it is a problem. I thought, with their capabilities, they could have done something within ecommerce, but that never happened. They are on a very slippery slope. When Bergman & Beving split up B&B Tools, Ulf Lilius took the good stuff with him and left unnecessary cost in the Bergman & Beving structure, which is slowly disappearing. Alingsås used to be Bergman & Bevings' headquarters, paying rent for an underutilized massive building.

### I was shocked to see Momentum's margins versus Bergman and Beving's. Momentum's margins are very high so Ulf has obviously made a clean start.

Ulf split the companies; Pontus who ran the ESSVE business got the role to head up Bergman & Beving, but he got what he was left with. When I joined the board, I felt sorry for Pontus because he was sitting with a lot of shit and the family has a policy not to take one-time costs. When they made that split, they should have written off underutilized factories and office spaces.

### Have they simply got more overheads or are you talking about subsidiaries?

I'm talking about costs to run the business stuck in Bergman and Beving, which is bleeding out over time. We will see an improvement in costs when the Alingsås lease expires and they move somewhere a smaller organization can fit into at a fraction of the cost.

### Why did Ulf leave all the crappy companies?

You could argue whether Luna should have stayed or gone because it is not a product company. I understand why they tried to split out the resellers and Momentum from the products and Luna, but the brands which remained were not strong. ESSVE is a very good brand but Luna Tools has always been a private label to fill assortment.

### What about the other brands, like Guide and FireSeal?

Guide is good and FireSeal is interesting. They bought ARBESKO which used to be one of the strongest brands in protective shoes in Sweden. It has been slightly mistreated but they can make a good return. Cresto is an interesting brand in fall safety. Guide is a very good brand. Ejendals is the market leader in gloves, and Guide is the second brand in Sweden. Skydda is a protective wear wholesaler which has been struggling because they compete with other brands they wholesale, which is a drag on the margin. Zekler has been built up as a good brand on protective air equipment. In protective wear, ARBESKO, Cresto, Guide and Zekler are valuable. They also have other businesses unrelated to brand; the niche profitable market leader in emergency exit signs. Teng Tools is a good brand that gained market share due to mismanagement of the Bahco brand in the Nordics. taken a lot of that business.

### Hultafors EBITA margin is closer to 20% than 10% so its higher than Guide would be or, potentially, some of the smaller premium brands Bergman & Beving has?

ESSVE is definitely a premium brand in its category, but they don't have any premium brands apart from that. Their second brands are not a cost alternative because they are still fairly good quality, but they are not recognized as best in class.

### Did Ulf decide where the product companies went when they split?

I joined the Bergman & Beving board after the split, but Ulf and I first spoke when I wanted to buy out ESSVE when Bergman & Beving were in financial trouble. Unfortunately, I was too cheap, otherwise they would have sold it at that time. I came back and said I would take all the products, but the Börjesson and Hedelius families couldn't agree because they both wanted to have the power.

### Who wanted the power?

Both the Börjesson and Hedelius families wanted to have power in the companies, but they are finally splitting up.

### Did they not want to sell to you because they would lose the products?

If the Hultafors Group bought that from them, they wanted to be part of the journey as an owner, but we didn't want to let go of the majority and no one wanted to leave the power on the table.

### Do those families still retain ownership?

Everyone agreed this was the logical thing to do, then Ulf went on and they divided the companies on the same level. I would never have bought Luna or Skydda.

### Can they sell those B2B distributors like Luna to Ahlsell or someone else?

I would not be surprised if that's what they do to increase overall margins in Bergman & Beving, but who will buy it? They could join Thomée to make one big wholesaler in Sweden, but I don't know who would be interested to pay.

### Would Ahlsell buy it?

They won't be interested because they have superior logistic operations and this would dilute their margins. They could sell it to a financial group who don't understand what they are doing.

### Would the two families be against selling it?

Jörgen is the chairman and was CEO of Lagercrantz; he is strong on driving margin and I don't see how he can increase margins substantially.

### Large suppliers sell products through Luna which they don't make much money from, so Magnus and the team said they're cutting that business to improve margins. Are you saying the structure of the industry has changed so much that Luna can no longer grow further?

It's difficult. I'm sure you can find a taker but how much will they pay?

### Is it worth 10 times EBIT?

No, it's not worth 10 times EBIT. It has to be combined with Thomée.

### Why hasn't the board done this already?

It's difficult to find someone.

### Who owns Thomée?

It was privately owned but is now owned by Volati, another compounder, so maybe they could do something together with it.

### Did the board explore this years ago?

When I went there, it was very unspecific what our business areas were. They took the chance when I left because the new owners I work for didn't allow me to stay in Bergman & Beving because they thought it might be a conflict of interest. I got a very relaxed call to ask if I would consider looking at their wholesale business but we decided not to pursue that. I'm more of a product person who believes in building a competitive advantage from that perspective. That is more scalable as you can look at geographic expansion, whereas a wholesaler or reseller model is more difficult and you will earn less with that type of model. Luna's logistic operations were best in class 15 years ago and were one of the first resellers to digitize replenishment systems. They tried to integrate B&B Tools forward but the reseller consolidation killed their model.

### How is Momentum different?

It's much more service, so they are at the industry.

### Do they serve the end customers?

Yes, they are more integrated, almost like business process outsourcing. Some products come with it so it's a completely different model. The Luna model is to move goods from A to B whereas Momentum solves problems for their customers.

### What was the story on the split because it seems like one family isn't on the Momentum Board, but both remain on Bergman and Beving; why is that? The Hedelius family is on Momentum but the Börjesson family is not. Fredrik Börjesson is on Bergman & Beving and I think his wife?

No, the sister. Then you have Hedelius, the son, is on Bergman & Beving.

### Exactly, but only Hedelius is on Momentum for some reason?

Perhaps they are not even in the ownership group.

### They are not.

I heard something happened between them. Tom and the Börjessons have had a good relationship over the years. Kristina Willgard is on my board and she was the CEO of AddLife. She told me it's a sad story, but for some reason, they are no longer going well together. I didn't notice that in the board between the younger generation but they have started to split up. They also split AddLife so the partnership is slowly disintegrating for personal reasons.

### Did Ulf have the say in splitting up because he was the B&B Tools CEO?

Yes, he ran the whole thing and was brought in to clean up the mess created by McKinsey people who produced a paper of what to do, but failed. The Hultafors Group suffered because they were losing market share and we were a much bigger client to them than Ahlsell was to us. Börjesson put Ulf in to clean up the mess and the first thing he said was, we built the monster by competing with our product companies and resellers for the Skydda business, so he wanted to divide it up in the right business models. Every CEO and board member met both Hedelius and Börjesson so he had the ear of both of them to divide the company up into three parts. The only sad part of the story is that the mother ship, Bergman & Beving, got the leftovers.

### Ulf got a great deal; he designed everything and took the best parts for Momentum, and is obviously now acquiring businesses, but Jörgen is not on his board?

The Nordstjernan family owns 50%, Tom Hedelius owns 9% of the votes but only 1% of the capital, and Ulf Lilius got 0.65% of the company. I'm not sure how he made this happen. I'm looking at Swedol because that's where the shops went. I am trying to see who the owner of that is but they are not a public company.

### Did Ulf get a new family involved in Momentum?

Yes.

### How did you start working with Pontus?

I wanted to buy the ESSVE business from him. Pontus wanted someone who understood the product business because the board wasn't product-oriented. He got me in and I had met the Börjesson family before when I was to buy the other product companies, so that's how I got onto the board. My feeling from the start was that Pontus did not have the support from Börjesson, but I cannot tell you why.

### From the owners?

Yes, Fredrik and Maria were not kind to him.

### Did they not believe in his ability?

The board did not want to realize Ulf had to take out the goodies in the companies and that it was in need of a lot of investments. They acquired Adesco, which passed its due date and, to revamp that product assortment, you need to invest in product development and branding, which was a new concept for them.

### Pontus took charge and the board didn't trust him. They realized Ulf had taken some of the best businesses into Momentum, so what did Pontus focus on?

He wanted to build stronger brands. He wanted to invest in innovation and brand building, which was unnatural for the board and the family because they come from industrial product distribution, where you don't need to build brands because it is more a central purchasing decision. Pontus came from ESSVE which is a brand more than anything.
