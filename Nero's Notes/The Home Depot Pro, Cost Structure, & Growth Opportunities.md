### My questions are focused around [[Home Depot]] but tend to be retail management questions, except for a few of them. I know you were there a decade ago and have more recent experience with other retail, so to the extent that these are not relevant, let me know.

When I was at [[Home Depot]], I was a direct report of Marvin, who left to JCPenney, and is now the CEO of Lowe's. Some of the things I am discussing with you are public information. Even though I have been removed as far as being on their salary, I have a variety of close friends who are still at Home Depot that I converse with weekly. Lowe's have actively recruited me for two years, based on my background with Marvin. I can speak well to 90% of the things you would ask, because of conversations I have had with current [[Home Depot]] folks but also Lowe's who are actively trying to recruit me.

### Great. Thinking about this SG&A cost algorithm at both those firms, what limits them? They have got great leverage and if we assume transactions keep growing below revenue because basket size has increased, they should continue to get leverage. However, it seems like in Home Depot's case, they are already at quite low levels, so how much further can they go?

There are many pressure points centered around what is actually in the news, which is the ability to source product from overseas and eliminate the log jam on coast lines. Much of that is increasing the cost because of the speed to fulfill customer demand. Last summer there was never a shortage of lumber, it was a shortage of people being able to get it to the big boxes, and in turn, everyone thought there was actually a lumber shortage. We still had the same amount of trees and wood.

The shortage was caused by the inability to get product to the job site or brick and mortar stores. Covid has put pressure on the ability of these big companies, which you can include Menards, especially on the building materials side. They continue to blame Covid for the lack of product and lumber prices are decreasing because customers refused to pay what I call gouging, during the pandemic. All three major players contributed to that. One example is the 12 to 16 week lead time to get fence posts to build a deck last year, which was maintained for 10 months. It has created a spotlight on the weaknesses all those companies.

### In a single store you can easily see, as transaction and traffic levels increase, you need more people. That is straightforward but when we consider that the basket size is also increasing at Home Depot, all of that is dropping. The gross profits start with the bottom line because it does not seem to affect SG&A much. We are trying to understand how much further that can go. If you were operating a single [[Home Depot]] or Lowe's, and were thinking about what the maximum SG&A leverage you could get, what is the lowest level to target for a fully optimized store?

I will give you an example because you are asking a very specific question. As sales and transactions increase, they are not adding labor and are leveraging that to profit. The consumer's experience is what suffers from that standpoint, because they are not putting more people in the store, even though they are increasing their revenue. It was 50%, but it is now 62% of the product purchased from Home Depot that goes directly from vendor to job site.

That plays to the business model whereas they are able to increase sales but, at the same time, not increase their largest expense which is labor. By not increasing the labor spend, it improves their overall bottom line.

### Home Depot recently said that the supply chain ecommerce investments they have made, including delivery job sites, has added 10% to their store base. Does that seem correct based on what you just said? Is that the right way to think about it?

Since at least 15 years ago, [[Home Depot]] leveraged the fact that they could include their product on the pro side. In 2010, the customer viewed Lowe's as a prettier place to shop, catering more to female shoppers who still make 82% of shopping decisions. Home Depot leveraged pro customers because they already had their own delivery system in place.

They have continued to leverage that strength against Lowe's by adding a second truck or delivery person. They will do two shifts, 6 AM to 2 PM, and 2 PM to 8 PM. There are definitely workarounds to improve and to build on Lowe's lack of strength. As a result of Covid, Lowe's are trying to add their individual private delivery system.

### Lowe's are emphasizing the pro customer now; is their ability to ramp up pro as a percent of business reasonable? Could they reach the Home Depot levels or is Home Depot so much more entrenched that Lowe's will not be able to do that?

Pro customers are not loyal; they are out to make their job easier. At the end of the day, they are not so concerned about price because pro customers simply transfer the cost to their current job. Lowe's are trying to add delivery trucks which they had 15 years ago, whereas Home Depot has already established that but also have the second truck or shift.

One of the big differences in the overall stock price is their ability to take care of that pro customer. Again, it is not so much cost. If I call Home Depot and tell them I have to have something by tomorrow morning 8 AM, they can achieve that request at a higher percentage than Lowe's or Menards. Menards do not own their own delivery system but subcontract to local jobbers, and are at the mercy of the person they hired locally to deliver their product on that individual's semi with their Moffett.

### Pro customers have different needs than do it yourself home owners so how was Home Depot able to build a successful pro business while continuing to satisfy their do-it-yourself home owners? Is there any color you could add to that question, as typically a business serving two different customer sets does not always go so well?

I will give you some of my history which will shed light on your question. I covered Southern Indiana and Northern Kentucky which was not an area of growth for population. For my district to achieve our goal of being number one in overall sales growth out of 72 districts or a third of the country, we had to take market share from the local lumber yards. In my case it was a very strong player in three states, called Kite Lumber, who had 12 locations.

Our entire plant business growth was centered around growing the pro business. Lowe's was a great competitor, but Kite Lumber had the majority of the pro business locked up for 15 to 20 years. When I came to that market we strategized against this local lumber yard, who had six locations in three states.

If you met a certain threshold as a pro customer spend, they would fly you and your significant other to Hawaii for 10 days, all expenses paid. They used this trip as a catalyst to keep these pro customers loyal to their lumber yards. We set up a meeting with a home builder who built 20 homes a year on spec. I asked him why he wouldn't give Home Depot a shot on the pro side, and his response was that he was loyal to Kite because of this trip.

I asked what he thought that trip was worth to him and his response was $20,000. The cost of an average house was $200,000 and I told him I could save him $4 million by reducing his cost by 10%.

I told him that, technically, he was paying $400,000 for a $20,000 vacation and asked him to give me an opportunity for the next three houses to prove I can save him 10%. Once I flipped that one biggest customer, they told everyone else and we were able to grow that pro business by almost 40%. Two out of the following three years we were the number one district and division in comp store sales increase, and Kite Lumber closed all but two sites after five years, going from nine locations to two.

### That was a very successful move on your part; well done.

At the end of the day, Home Depot gives you the opportunity to use their system to leverage those customers, and will always allow the pro, even if you are losing money. They will allow you to beat a competitor on any bid, many times going 10% below a competitor. Once you start proving that model, they were able to use that as a position of strength. I am not saying that you and I going in and buying something at Home Depot is not important to the business; it is, but the overall volume is the pro side.

### Home Depot has not built any stores for a decade, yet they have clearly increased volumes from do-it-yourself home owners going in. Regardless of what they report, obviously there is more activity going on, so how will Home Depot build out their store base further, in terms of their need to and their opportunity to do so?

Their focus will be more on the ecommerce side, as they continue to build out distribution centers that can do it through the internet, versus building more brick and mortar. They have done a great job increasing that customer basket, so if you have the same amount of customers but their baskets have increased, they have probably done a better job than their competitors in regards to leveraging their private label brand. They have exclusive brands such as Ryobi, Husky and Rigid, which you cannot find at any other competitors.

Their white label or private label is not at Lowe's, but pro customers feel like the Rigid brand is theirs and home improvement customers think Ryobi is theirs. They will continue to be very innovative inside those two brands, which will continue to drive loyalty. Home Depot have run the same commercials for 25 years, which also helps builds the brand.

### I know you left Home Depot in 2011 but when did you start there?

I started in 2005.

### Right at the peak of the housing boom, so at that time you had increasing traffic in the stores and they were still building many new stores. When you have a growth opportunity, you have to lay the new stores out, even if it hurts transactions in the near term because you have to get the right locations. I am curious how busy the stores were across the country at that point and how much traffic were they handling? Were they growing their store count quickly because the existing stores were at full capacity or was there simply that much opportunity that they were still in a position to increase traffic levels inside stores while adding new stores?

My background was with Walmart prior to Home Depot. I was with Home Depot until January 2012 but my profile shows I left in 2011. The stores felt like they were so busy, but it was so boring because they were not busy. I was used to doing $3 million a week per site, and these stores were only doing $300,000; literally 10% of the volume of a Walmart. When I had Home Depot people tell me we were so busy, I would tell them we were only running two registers and had 16 we could still open.

During my tenure there, my district was tapped to innovate with self check-outs, as a test for the company. We installed them and everybody could not believe we were putting self check-outs in a Home Depot. Customers were already used to seeing it in all the other big boxes, so they were the least of our worries. We took the labor we saved on the front end and put them out on the sales floor to wait on customers. It quickly became a win:win and they ended up adopting self check-out in the whole company. Even though I had those three states, they gave me a second district in Northern Michigan, some of which had high volume.

It was still only a $40 million store which had the ability to do $100 million, so to me it was very low volume. Keep in mind that of that $40 million, $20 million was going from the vendor to the job site, so you were still only seeing $20 million in a box which could probably do $80 million without putting stress on it.

### There was room and there might still be, to increase capacity, both through bypassing stores but also through adopting different in store processes such as self check-out and others; is that what you are getting at?

Yes, but you would think differently from an analyst or customer standpoint. If you went there on a Saturday at 11 AM, it was way different to the rest of the week, in terms as the amount of customers going through.

### Yes, that makes sense. My next questions are beyond home improvement. If we assume retailers will have to accept higher labor costs, not a onetime adjustment but an ongoing trend of wage growth running higher than the past decade, possibly at rates they were running in the 80s and 90s, how will retailers adapt?

If the labor pool shrinks, it will increase the overall cost to Home Depot. Shareholders will always expect them to make more profit than they did the last quarter. If the labor model goes from an average of $12 an hour to $15, they have one of two choices.

They can continue to reduce the hours spent in store on customer service, or increase sales to offset that additional labor spend. They could also simply pass all that additional cost onto consumers by raising prices. Many times, they will leverage the need to bring the quarter by reducing the amount of margin they would be willing to pay a vendor. They still want vendors to be able to take care of them, but they do not have a leg in the game. As long as they are in business, they couldn’t care less how the vendor does financially.

Any live plants or product that Home Depot or Lowe's sell in lawn and garden is vendor owned, so they do not pay the vendor until that product sells. This is during peak season which is between April and Labor Day. If they have a 20% loss because they forgot to water, they couldn’t care less because all that cost is translated to the vendor. There are only a few vendors who could afford that kind of loss in order to service a Home Depot.

They will continue to leverage that pay per scan model. They will do the same thing with a mulch supplier where they will not pay them until it is actually sold through the register; it may be sitting on that inventory for three or four months for free. It is a nasty way of to do it, but no big box now pays for their live goods; it has all become pay per scan.

At Dollar General and Walmart, all the greeting cards which are 70% to 90% margin are never paid for until they go through the register. That also eliminates all the loss because if the customer steals it instead of paying for the greeting card, there is no loss to the company.

### You gave two examples of that happening; I understand that live plants are perishable but for which other categories does that situation occur?

I never wanted to become a buyer because they are always wrong. They either bought too much and had to take mark downs to eliminate the product for the next season, or they bought too few and ran out before the season was over. To make it through their next evaluation, buyers are always looking for ways to solidify their position for the next year, and one way to survive that is to move a vendor to pay per scan, on the products they are carrying.

When they are able to source that product and have it on the shelf until it sells, it improves overall margins and allows them not to worry about their role. Other categories which continue to diminish due to technology, include magazines, paperbacks and hard back books. None of those are owned by the retailer; most are pay per scan in the big box stores.

### Home Depot make a big deal how they treat their associates so well and they paid out $2 billion last year in excess wages around Covid. Are they ahead of the game enough that they have some cushion compared to the rest of the industry?

Lowe's did something similar. They were all trying to incentivize their workers or associates to show up for work. If they never missed a certain amount of days, they would receive a bonus. Where Home Depot differed from Lowe's is that prior to Covid, if the store met that incentive, they got a percentage of a bonus. I remember associates who averaged $400 per week working in store and who were handed a $2,000 six-month bonus. That equates to six weeks’ worth of wages and some of them would start crying when they received it. $2,000 was a lot of money to them and it was simply for showing up. Those are the things which make you feel good about working 60 to 70 hours per week, but they also drive loyalty. Home Depot have people who have been there for 20 to 30 years.

Someone who has been selling flooring for 25 years knows more than their supervisor who is only 25 years old and fresh out of college. Home Depot has such a strong tenure of hourly and medium range supervisory associates. That is not to say that Lowe's does not have people with tenure, but they do not celebrate it the way Home Depot does.

### My last question is on fast growing retail concepts. Can we go back to this idea of balancing maximum traffic through your store versus having more stores which may cannibalize from existing stores. When adding locations in a particular city, you know you will eventually have several locations there, but the faster you build those out, the more it will impact your same store sales comps. Do you simply look at total growth on a combined basis or is there some level of comps you want to maintain while growing your store count?

They are supposed to adjust it based on the predictions of how that store will cannibalize the neighboring group of stores. Many times, that new store cannibalizes more than originally thought, so it causes pain at district or market level because they cannot reach their overall sales growth target. It is more important to accurately forecast what your volume will be and where it will come from.

A percentage will be cannibalized but there will also be a percentage market share taken from a competitor. Many times, Home Depot will open up on an 84 Lumber which will shut down within six to 12 months. Some of these smaller players disappear when they open a new build out. From a budgeting standpoint and a year over year growth, when we build these new sites, we have to perform both accurate forecasts and budgets.

If a store is cannibalized by 20% on lumber, it does not matter because lumber does not spoil. What will cost the store profit margin is if they lose 20% of seasonal sales such as Christmas trees and decorations, Halloween or spring. Home Depot's Christmas is in May. Christmas itself is important to retail but, overall, it is one of their slowest periods. In an effort to counteract that, Black Friday now starts November 1st, when they push appliances because they are simply trying to suck the money from the community while they still have some. Before long we could see Black Friday specials during October.

### My final question is around a theoretical retail concept. If you were an adviser looking at them growing their store count by 10% to 15% a year, but comps are pretty flat, would you tell them they are growing their store count too fast, or would you tell them they have that much opportunity to grow the store count and fill up those stores quickly while keeping comps flat year after year and that if they keep growing, they can raise their same store comps later?

If you can maintain single digit comp growth and grow your store count, that is the sweet spot. Never be flat otherwise analysts will ask why you did not grow comp sales. They had 8% growth in Q2 of 2020, and in Q2 of 2021, they had 4.5% growth comp. Analysts will always look at comp growth as part of their formula on stock valuations. When I left Home Depot, my wife told me to sell at $36, but today it is $350.

When Jerry Jones asked Deion Sanders if he wanted $10 million or $15 million per year, he responded that he wanted both, $25 million. I will answer your question similarly. They want store count growth in addition to comp store sales growth on a quarterly basis. Nobody will congratulate them on their growth if their comps are flat. Instead, they will ask why they are growing their store count.

### I appreciate your time today, thank you so much.

Have a good afternoon.
