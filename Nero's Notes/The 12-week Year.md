# The 12-week year


## Vision

- When you think about a compelling vision, the neurons that fire in your brain are the same neurons that fire when you act on your vision. What that means is that you can literally train your brain to act on your vision just by thinking about it. The first step, though, is creating an inspiring vision and learning how to stay connected with it.

## One week at a time

> The greatest predictor of your future are your daily actions.

- Your current actions are creating your future. If you want to know what your future holds, look to your actions; they are the best predictor of your future:
	- You want to predict your future health, look at your current eating and exercise habits.
	- You want to predict the health of your marriage, look at your interactions with your spouse. 
	- You want to predict your career path and future income, look at the actions you take each business day.
Your actions tell the story.
