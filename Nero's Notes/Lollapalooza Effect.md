### Plain English

The Lollapalooza Effect occurs when many different factors come together, leading to multiplicative rather than additive results.  

A common mistake is to look at a situation linearly or in isolation. You must take all factors into account and, as best as you can, understand how they fit together and might impact each other. This is such a vital idea because it can occur in all complex systems – everything from sports, investing, relationships, business, nature, and more.

### Technical Description

**Munger uses the term “Lollapalooza Effect” for multiple biases, tendencies, or mental models acting in compound with each other at the same time in the same direction, often resulting in extreme outcomes.**

From Wikipedia:

“During a talk at Harvard in 1995 entitled The Psychology of Human Misjudgment, Munger mentions Tupperware parties and open outcry auctions, where he explained “three, four, five of these things work together and it turns human brains into mush,” meaning that normal people will be highly likely to succumb to the multiple irrational tendencies acting in the same direction. In the Tupperware party, you have reciprocation, consistency and commitment tendency, and social proof. (The hostess gave the party and the tendency is to reciprocate; you say you like certain products during the party so purchasing would be consistent with views you’ve committed to; other people are buying, which is the social proof.) In the open outcry auction, there is social proof of others bidding, reciprocation tendency, commitment to buying the item, and deprivation super-reaction syndrome, i.e. sense of loss. The latter is an individual’s sense of loss of what he believes should be or is his. These biases often occur at either conscious or subconscious level, and in both microeconomic and macroeconomic scale.”

### Quotes

> The most important thing to keep in mind is the idea that especially big forces often come out of these one hundred models. When several models combine, you get lollapalooza effects; this is when two, three, or four forces are all operating in the same direction. And, frequently, you don’t get simple addition. It often like a critical mass in physics where you get a nuclear explosion if you get to a certain point of mass-and you don’t get anything much worth seeing if you don’t reach the mass. Sometimes the forces just add like ordinary quantities and sometimes they combine on a breakpoint or critical-mass basis. More commonly, the forces coming out of these one hundred models are conflicting to some extent. And you get huge, miserable tradeoffs. But if you can’t think in terms of tradeoffs and recognize tradeoffs in what you’re dealing with, you’re a horse’s patoot. You clearly are a danger to the rest of the people when serious thinking is being done. You have to recognize how these things combine. And you have to realize the truth of biologist Julian Huxley’s idea that “Life is just one damn relatedness after another.” So, you must have the models, and you must see the relatedness and the effects from the relatedness. – Charlie Munger, Outstanding Investor Digest, December 29, l997
