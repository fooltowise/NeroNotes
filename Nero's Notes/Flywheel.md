# Flywheels
Flywheels — positive feedback loops — come in many powerful forms and operate at various speeds: self-reinforcing network effects, ever-improving cost structures, complementary revenue streams, etc.

When you spot a flywheel pay close attention.

Exemple: Amazon
- A lower cost structure-> Lower Prices -> Better customer experience 
- Better customer experience -> More traffic -> More sellers -> More selection -> Better customer experience
