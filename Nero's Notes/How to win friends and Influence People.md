> The great aim of education is not knowledge but action. Herbert Spencer.

This is an action book.

### How to get the most out of this book
1. The main requirement to get the most out of the book is a deep, driving desire to learn, a vigorous determination to increase your ability to deal with people. Say to yourself, "**My popularity, my happiness and sense of worth depend to no small extent upon my skill in dealing with people.**"
2. Read each chapter rapidly at first to get a bird's view of it. Then go back and reread it thoroughly. In the long run, this will mean saving time and getting results.
3. Stop frequently in your reading to think over what you are reading. Ask yourself just how and when you can apply each suggestion.
4. Marking and underscoring a book makes it more interesting, and far easier to review rapidly.
5. If you want to get a real, lasting benefit out of this book, don't imagine that skimming through it once will suffice. After reading it thoroughly, you ought to spend a few hours reviewing it every month. Glance through it often. **The use of these principles can be made habitual only by a constant and vigorous campaign of review and application.** 
6. We only learn by doing. Apply the rules in this book at every opportunity.
7. Offer your spouse, your child or some business associate a dime or a dollar every time he or she catches you violating a certain principle. Make a lively game out of mastering these rules.
8. Check up each week on the progress you are making. Ask yourself what mistakes you have made, what improvement, what lessons you have learned for the future.
9. **Develop a deep, driving desire to master the principles of human relations**

## Part 1- Fundamental Techniques In Handling People
### Chapter 1. If you want to gather honey, don't kick over the beehive.
- Most people [[Counterfeit reasons|rationalize]] their bad behavior to justify their antisocial acts to other people and most importantly to themselves. People hate to blame themselves. **They don't criticize themselves for anything, no matter how wrong it may be.**
- Criticism is **futile** because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to **justify** himself. 
- Criticism is **dangerous**, because it wounds a person's precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses **resentment**.

By criticizing, we do not make lasting changes and often incur resentment. Sharp criticisms and rebukes almost invariably end in futility. 

When dealing with people, let's remember that we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.
