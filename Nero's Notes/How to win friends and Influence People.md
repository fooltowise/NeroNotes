## Criticism

> Criticism is futile because it puts a person on the defensive and usually makes him strive to justify himself. Criticism is dangerous, because it wounds a person’s precious pride, hurts his sense of importance, and arouses resentment. …. Any fool can criticize, condemn and complain—and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.

That reminds me of this famous quote by Thomas Carlyle: _“A great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men.”_

## People are Emotional

> When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.

## The Key to Influencing Others

> \[T\]he only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.

## The Secret of Success

> If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.



 *To get along with people you need to direct your actions towards their egos. To make people like you, compliment them, talk in terms of their wants, make them feel important, smile big, and remember their name. If you want to persuade somebody, don’t argue, and never contradict them; instead, be friendly, emphasize the things you agree on, get them to do most of the talking, and let them take credit for every bright idea.*
