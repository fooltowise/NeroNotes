# Grilled Aubergines

1 aubergine
2 tbsp olive oil
1 tub fresh pesto (optional)

Slice the aubergine length-ways into 1cm slices. 
Arrange the aubergines over a grill pan.
Brush lightly with oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, then grill until golden.

Flip them over, brush again with oil, season and grill again until tender and golden. 

Spoon a little pesto onto each and grill briefly if you like.
