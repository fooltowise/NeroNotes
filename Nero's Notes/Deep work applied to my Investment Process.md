# Deep Work applied to my Investment Process

My big, hairy goal is to grow my wealth by 20+ percent annually.
To do that I will need to be able to distinguish [[Lollapalooza Effect| lollapalooza companies]].

The three main activities that support this professional goal (and for which I should prioritize [[Deep Work]]) are:

### 1. Improve my investment judgment:
- Read and assimilate investing books and articles
- Understand how the world works by assimilating general non-fiction books and articles
- Make a habit to study Lollapalooza effects, how to reproduce them, and how to find them


### 2. Review a lot of investment opportunities
- Review one company per day. Start with the As.
- If a company proves to be a likely candidate, spend more time analyzing it
- Get interesting ideas from like-minded investors over FinTwit/Dataroma/Seeking Alpha

### 3. Review my portfolio regularly
- Only what I own can hurt me
- Monitor my opportunity cost
- Reallocate when a company proves to be an investing mistake
