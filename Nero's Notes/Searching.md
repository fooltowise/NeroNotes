# Searching

Search algorithms can be classified in a number of ways. Is the underlying collection static or dynamic, i.e, inserts and deletes are interleaved with searching? Is it worth spending the computational cost to pre-process the data so as to speed up subsequent queries? Are there statistical properties of the data that can be exploited? Should we operate directly on the data or transform it?
