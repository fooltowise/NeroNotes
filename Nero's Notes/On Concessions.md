# On Concessions

Getting one concession feels like a win, but doing a concession feels like a loss. Because of [[Deprival Super-reaction Syndrome]],  making concessions feels more bad than getting concessions feels good. 

This is why so many negotiations fail. Just look at labor unions representatives vs business owners.



On the other hand, making willingly a concession can activate in your counterparty a [[Reciprocation Tendency]] which can be used to your advantage.
