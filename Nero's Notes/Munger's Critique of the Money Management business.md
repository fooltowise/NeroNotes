# Munger's Critique of the Money Management business

### Flawed incentives
The general system of money management today require people to pretend to do something they can't do and like something they don't. It's a terrible way to spend your like, but it's very well paid.

### No value added
Mutual funds charge two percent per year and then brokers switch people between funds, costing another three to four percentage points. The poor guy in the general public is getting a terrible product from the professionals. I think it's disgusting. It's much better to be part of a system that delivers value to the people who buy the product. But if it makes money, we tend to do it in this country.

It's a funny business because on a net basis, the whole investment management business together gives no value added to all buyers combined. That's the way it has to work.

### Stockbrokers vs Index Funds
It's hard to sit here at this annual meeting, surrounded by smart, honorable stockbrokers who do well for their clients, and criticize them. But stockbrokers, in toto, will do so poorly that the index fund will do better.

I think indexing is a wiser choice for the average foundation than what it is now doing in unleveraged equity investment - and particularly so at is present total croupier costs, exceed one percent of principal per annum. Indexing can't work well forever if everybody turns to it. But it will work all right for a long term.

### The mutual fund scandal
The business of selecting investment managers was recently shown to be even harder by the revelation that a significant fraction of mutual fund managers took a bribe to betray their own shareholders. 
It was as if a man came up and said "Why don't we kill your mother, and we'll split the insurance money?" And many people said "Why, yes, I'd like some of that insurance money."

And many of them think what happened to them was unjust. 
If mutual fund directors are independent, I'm the lead character in the Bolshoi ballet.
