Interview between Farnam Street and Cal Newport:

FS: **What would you recommend for people working at home who have a home office? In a way, there’s different distractions at home than the workplace. **

CN : Yeah. 

FS: **Is there anything that you know to be common to get people into a state of deep work?**

CN: If you’re at home, ritual is incredibly important. You have to have ritual, by which I mean a ritual surrounding when you do deep work and certainly a ritual surrounding what you do when you start deep work. Otherwise you’re going to be hosed. It’s just too amorphous. Too much stuff mixed together. 

To me, the canonical example here is Charles Darwin, right? He did all of his work On The Origin of Species at his estate in England, at home. What he did is he had a timing ritual and a physical ritual surrounding his deep work every day. At the same time each day is when he would start his deep work On The Origin of Species and the first thing he would do would be to walk a certain number of circuits on a path that he had built on his estate. He called it the sand walk. He would do a certain number of circuits and that’s where he would ease into the topic he was going to think or write about that day. He would do the certain number of loops to get his mind going and then after that, it was to his desk or to the aviary if he was doing experiments or whatever it was. A certain number of hours after that he would do his deep work and then it was done. 

**You have to have that Darwin-style ritual if you spend all day at home, otherwise the deep work is going to get just mixed up and mashed up with everything else and you’re not going to get where you want to get.**




FS:  **Let’s end with this: if there are one or two major takeaways you’d have people start doing immediately to build their focus work habits, what might those be?**

CN: I’d say number one, start embracing boredom in your life at a regular basis. Every day, have multiple long occasions where you don’t expose yourself to novel stimuli on your phone or the computer, even though you’re bored and want to. That lays the foundation. 

Two, use your calendar. Start regularly scheduling meetings with yourself in which you can work with complete deep work on something you find important. Again, that time, for this to count, has to feature zero glances at the Internet. It’s got to just be completely unbroken. Even a little bit of glance is going to drastically reduce the effectiveness. 

Put boredom in your life right away. Start scheduling some deep work in your life right away. Do that for a while and then just start ratcheting up those numbers. A little bit more boredom in your life. A little bit more hours of deep work each week. Ratchet up those numbers slowly. I think that’s the quickest progression into getting to a place of a non-trivial amount of true depth in your life
