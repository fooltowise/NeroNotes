Service businesses benefit from growing their installed base in numerous ways aside from direct growth in sales and service revenue. Density economics contribute value: the more installed equipment in a region, the more efficient its maintenance becomes. Service personnel spends less time travelling between sites and have more experience with local environment effects on equipment. The greater the density, the lower the cost of [[Recurring Revenues]] and, therefore, the greater the profit.

Network effects add value: the larger the service network, the faster it can meet customer needs, especially high speed of repair. Consider the farmer whose tractir breaks down mid-harvest. Swift repair is vital and the manufacturer with a nearby service center will get the job done more speedily. When shopping for equipment initially and evaluating after-purchase service arrangements, such businesses consider proximity a selling point. A larger service network is able to provide it.
