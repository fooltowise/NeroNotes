# Never Lose Money
Compounding at a moderate but steady rate of return over a long period of time is vastly superior to merely generating sharp outperformance for a year or two. Averages can be grossly misleading, so we should always use a geometric progression and look at *compound annual growth rate* if we want to understand returns the right way. 

An investor with 14% average annual return (20%, 40%, 20%, -50%, and 40%)  over a five year period ***underperforms*** someone with 9% average annual return if the latter is consistent every year. As of February 2018, only 5% of the listed Indian companies with at least INR 10 crores  of net profit grew earnings by more than 20% CAGR over the preceding 10 years. Against that, 55% of the companies had an earnings decline. Since earnings drive returns in the long term, it just goes to say how difficult it is to compound wealth by more than 20% on a sustainable basis. (Achieving a CAGR of 50% for a few years is commendable, but achieving a CAGR of 20% for six decades is what makes a Warren Buffett. He played the game for the longest time and became the biggest winner.)

Investing success is very challenging over a long time period. A bull market year or two in between fools many market participants into thinking otherwise. It takes a fairly short time to learn how to make money but a lifetime to learn how not to lose it. Margin of Safety in investing is necessary to avoid *compounding in reverse*.

**A stable investor who earns 20% for two consecutive years comes out ahead of a flamboyant newcomer who earns 100% in a bull market year and loses 30% or more in the following year.** Most of the inexperience investors realize this harsh math the painful way when junk stocks finally start crashing after a bull market, and only then do they begin to appreciate the significant importance of investing in quality. 

Buffett's adaptation of margin of safety for the masses is :

**Rule number 1: Never lose money.**
**Rule number 2: Never forget rule number 1.**
