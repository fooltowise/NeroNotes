# Doubt Avoidance Tendency

The brain of man is programmed with a tendency to quickly remove doubt by reaching some decision.

It is easy to see how evolution would make animals, over the eons, drift toward such quick elimination of doubt. After all, the one thing that is surely counterproductive for a prey animal that is threatened by a predator is to take a long time in deciding what to do. And so man's doubt avoidance tendency is quite consistent with the history of his ancient, nonhuman ancestors.

So pronounced is the tendency in man to quickly remove doubt by reaching some decision that behavior to counter the tendency is required from judges and jurors. Here, delay before decision making is forced. And one is required to so comport himself, prior to decision time, so that he is wearing a "mask" of objectivity. And the "mask" works to help real objectivity along , as we shall see when we next consider [[Inconsistency Avoidance Tendency]].

Of course, once one has recognized that man has a strong doubt avoidance tendency, it is logical to believe that at least some leaps of religious faith are greatly boosted by this tendency. Even if one is satisfied that is own faith comes from revelation, one still must account for the inconsistent faiths of others. And man's doubt avoidance tendency is almost surely a big part of the answer.

What triggers doubt-avoidance tendency? Well, an unthreatened man, thinking of nothing in particular, is not being prompted to remove doubt through rushing to some decision. As we shall see later when we get to the [[Social Proof]] and [[Stress Influence Tendency]], what usually triggers doubt avoidance tendency is some combination of puzzlement and stress. And both of these factors naturally occur in facing religious issues.

Thus, the natural state of most men is in some form of religion. And this is what we observe.
