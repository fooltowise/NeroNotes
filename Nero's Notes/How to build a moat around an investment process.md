# How to build a moat around an investment process

### [[Inversion|Invert]] the concept: how to ensure mediocrity:
- Easy to execute
- Reliant on "industry standards" tools
- Excessively diversified (hugging the index, increased fee-based AUM)
- Susceptible to outside influence (trading ideas with outside management (social proof), pitches from sell-side research)


### Investors also want REPEATABILITY

Bad examples:
- is sharing ideas repeatable?
- Relying on one-off macro call? (ex: the big short)
- Guessing next quarter's earnings?
- Outsourcing idea generation?

### Idea generation: qualitative vs quantitative
See [[Two modes of investment idea generation]]

### The moat around the investment process:

#### Team:
Staffed team of research analysts with ample field travel budget

#### Focus:
Study qualitative differentiation around moats, management teams, and underappreciated areas of growth

#### Discipline:
Cap AUM to ensure strategy success and concentrate on best ideas.

## Moat is not an Edge

Differentiation may not lead to outperformance.
