# Teqnion Checklist



## People - Does the company has great people behind it?

### Is the CEO passionate about the business opportunity?
1. Does the CEO have a visionary attitude towards the business' opportunities?
   
   Yes. Johan Steene wants to buy small industrial companies with good cash flows, operate them and own them forever. Buying opportunities are plenty and if they keep their pricing discipline, they will manage to double EPS every 5 years.
   
2. Does the CEO think independently and exhibit original ideas?
   Yes. For instance, He cold calls companies to see if they would be willing to sell, rather than going through brokers.
   
3. Does the CEO have strong market insight? **TODO: check in book**
   
   
4. Has the CEO stayed in the same industry for more than a decade?
   Yes, Johan Steene has founded the company in 2006.
   
5. Does the CEO show genuine excitement for their products?
   Yes, he is excited about creating good businesses with good people.
   
6. *Does the CEO serve on a significant number of outside boards?*
   No. As far as I know he only serves at Teqnion.


### Does management appear to have strong execution capabilities?
1. Does management have complementary skills and relevant sector experience?
   Yes, they are all coming from industrial company. The CFO/CXO does not, but he has extensive knowledge into capital allocation and investments.
   
2. Have the senior team and CEO been together for more than five years?
   
   No, it looks like a big turnover happened in 2018. **TODO: figure out why.** -> is it linked to the IPO?
   
3. Is there a sound strategy for long-term growth?
   Yes. The serial acquirer playbook in  industrial niche companies is a tried and tested one. Between organic growth and acquisitions, there is a good runway to double earnings every five years.
   
4. Does management tend to deliver on promises, on time and according to plan?
   
   So far (two years and a half since the IPO), cash flows and EPS have grown bigger than promised.
   
5. Has the CEO done it successfully before? Depends what to call "before". Johan Steene has been at it for 16 years now. **TODO: check more detail in the book**
6. *Does the CEO face personal challenges that might cloud his or her judgement?*
   None that I could find.

### Does management appear to use shareholders money well?
1. Do the company's incentive plans encourage long-term value creation?
   
   Yes and no. As the founder, the CEO has 45 times more equity than his annual compensation, which incentivises him to create long term wealth. There is also a mid-term option program (only for three years maturity!) which in my opinion is not long-term enough.
   
2. Do investments and acquisitions focus on strengthening the core business?
   
   The core business IS about acquisitions.
   
3. Is there consistency in the people responsible for capital allocation?
   Yes. As a serial acquirer, capital allocation is well taken care of.
   
4. Has the company taken opportunistic action over an attractively priced stock?
   No, but a) the stock has not been listed for long, and b) they likely have better opportunities in buying private companies.
   
5. Have total shares in issue remained constant or decreased over time?
   There was a slight increase due to the option program. 
   
6. *Does the company lack a sound dividend payout policy?*
   
   The company's dividend policy is to distribute 10-40% of the Group's profit after tax. **TODO: check the reasoning behind this policy**

### Is communication with shareholders open and honest?
1. Is management sincere and upfront about the business' difficulties and mistakes?
   So far the public history is too short to judge. I know that they had plenty of issues in 2008, but they were not listed at the time so it is hard to read their communication.
   
   
2. Does the CEO uphold company values and link them to its success?
3. Is management's communication timely and clear?
   Yes. Communication arrives on time and the current challenges faced by the company are explained in the quarterly letters.
4. Does management consistently use the same "story" and key metrics?
   So far yes. As a typical Swedish serial acquirer, Teqnion is big on EBITA margin >9%, debt to ebita ratio of less than 2.5. They also track EPS (should double every five years) and roce
   
5. Is communication focused on long-term business value? Yes. They have a 50 years horizon.
   
6. *Is management's responsiveness to inquiries poor?* **TODO: haven't communicated with IR department yet**

### Does the company have reasonable levels of executive pay?
1. Does the CEO's pay appear reasonable for a company of this size and profit level?
   Yes. CEO is paid 260k CHF, which is both reasonable and 45 times less than his equity holdings.
   
2. Does the company disclose bonus measures and targets?
	**Variable remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer of Teqnion** is calculated as 3% of the difference between the profit for the year before tax and the average profit before tax for the last three years. The calculation excludes extraordinary income and expenses such as reversal of earn-out payments and impairment of goodwill. The maximum variable salary is nine (9) months' salary and is not pensionable. **Senior executives and other key employees of the parent company** Variable remuneration for all senior executives (CFO) and other key employees of the parent company, totalling five (5) persons, amounts in total to 3% of the difference between the profit for the year before tax and the average profit before tax for the last three years.

   CEO's pay is 1.6 times CFO's pay.
   
5. Do the CEO's exit payments appear reasonable?
   Not mentioned in the annual report. **TO DO: check where i could get this info.**
   
6. Is the company free of any abuse of options or equity-based incentives?
   There is only a small option program that does not look malign so far.

   Depends what we mean by "independent". Most are heavily invested in the company. **TODO: check definition in the book.**
   
2. Does the board hold regular meetings without the CEO to review his or her performance?
   
   No. In this setup it looks like the board is not really independent. Yet the CEO is also founder and owner of the company...

### Is the business model repeatable and scalable?
1. Are a major portion of existing or potential revenues recurring?

   Subsidiaries are working in slow changing industrial markets. That's definitely not web technologies...
   
4. Does the business have limited competition?
   There is definition in the serial acquirer scheme in Sweden, but so far I'd say the pond is big enough for all the fishes. There are really a lot of small industrial companies in the nordics to be acquired. [[Lagercrantz]], Lifco, Volati and co have proved that they can coexist and still have very healthy profitability.
