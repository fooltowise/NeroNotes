# [[CSU]] Q2 2008 Letter to Shareholders

## TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS

Q2 was a good quarter for Constellation, particularly in light of the difficult economic environment. We achieved record levels of Adjusted EBITDA ($14 million) and Adjusted Net Income ($12 million), and 5% Organic Net Revenue growth. 

In Q2 of 2006, Constellation became a public company. Net Revenue during that quarter was $47 million. Net Revenue in Q2 of this year was $71 million – a 23% compound annual growth rate since the IPO. While some of this growth was organic, the majority of it was acquired. We issued no new shares during the IPO nor have we issued any since then, so the intervening acquisitions were financed from our earnings (~$73 million), and borrowings/cash reductions (~$26 million). 


Until recently, we had avoided using significant amounts of debt. Circumstances, however, may dictate a change in our capital structure. The economy is slow, credit and equity markets are in rough shape, and buyers for vertical market software businesses are increasingly scarce. Concurrently, and for some of the same reasons, quite a number of vertical market software businesses are for sale at attractive prices. We may not be the successful bidders for these assets, but if we are, we will almost certainly be increasing Constellation’s financial leverage. In support of our acquisition pursuits, we negotiated an increase in our revolving bank line to $105 million during Q2 and are currently in discussions with our lenders to further increase the size of this facility. We are also examining other financing alternatives. 

Rapid acquired growth is not an imperative, it is a choice. For most of the last decade we struggled to find enough attractive acquisitions to consume our operating cash flows. We believe that the situation has now reversed, and we are sorely tempted to buy as many attractive vertical market software businesses as and while we can.

A table containing our quarterly Performance Metrics is appended. We have discussed the definitions and implications of the various metrics in previous letters to shareholders, and a glossary is also provided. This quarter, I was pleased with our performance across all of the metrics but wanted to draw your attention to one in particular. When economic times are tough, and bonuses are tied to financial performance, there’s a strong incentive for the managers of any business to aggressively recognise revenue. I believe that our people are largely inured to such temptations, but there’s a quick way to cross-check. Aggressive revenue recognition nearly always gives rise to an associated increase in accounts receivable and work in process. We should be able to see any such movements in our Tangible Net Assets/Net Revenue metric. In Q2 of 2008, this metric was -58%, down from -45% and -51% in Q2 of 2007 and 2006 respectively. This improvement over prior years suggests that, if anything, our businesses are being conservative about the earnings that they are reporting.
