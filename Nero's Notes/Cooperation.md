Cooperation teaches us to seek out and frame interactions based not only on what we can get, but also what we can give. If there was any one model that explains humanity, then this is it. 

Cooperation unleashed the potential of the human species. Working and collaborating with others gives us options and opportunities that are unavailable when we insist on going it alone. 

Furthermore, when you don't have time to evolve in response to changes in the environment, cooperation can significantly impreove your chances of survival by pursuing relationshipsthat bring mutual benefit.

Cooperation led to the powerful brains that we have, capable of art and abstract thinking. Our complex societies are built on our ability to work with each other, believe in the same ideas, and share the same goals.

Cooperation is the fuel that powers our day, from raising our children, to the jobs we perform, and he social structures that give us everything from leisure time to meaning and purpose. 

When we cooperate, we lighten our individual loads and sometimes create something brand new.
