# Progress will come from a change in perception
It seems likely that the biggest progress in the next 50 years may come not from improvements in technology but in psychology and design thinking. Put simply, it's easy to achieve massive improvements in *perception* at a fraction of the cost of equivalent improvements in *reality*.

Making a train journey 20 per cent faster might cost hundreds of millions, but making it 20 per cent more enjoyable may cost almost nothing. You only may need to include an entertainment system in the train seats, vs creating new trains and tracks that are actually quicker.
