### What were your responsibilities when you first joined Beckman?

I joined in November 2007 and they hired me because of my science background. I was at Scripps Research at the time, doing an immunology post-doctoral fellowship and they needed to speak with pathologists but had no PhDs in their sales organization. They had a PhD, Dr Dave Schaffner, who was director of medical affairs but he couldn't be everywhere. Initially, they put me in coagulation and, for the first three and a half years, things were doing very well. We had a partnership with Instrumentation Laboratory who had recently released an amazing system which they were trying to commercialize and build US territories with 25 specialists on board. They knew they would have to move me up after three and a half years years and Dave Vespalco, who was VP of North American sales, approved me becoming one of the scientific affairs officers, which I thought I wanted to do, but I turned it down. I was connected at the scientific level and gave seminars because of my background, but 90% of my time was on the ground sales.

### Did you only work in coag or did you move into other sides of the business?

I loved coag because it was definitely complicated, which was just the way I like it. In 2011, Beckman Coulter screwed up by making several changes to the troponin assay without informing the regulatories, and the FDA made them remove that assay from the platform. Troponin is one of the biggest biomarkers for cardiac so that threw everything into a tail spin. At the time, Scott Garrett, the CEO of the company, said we were complacent. They were trying to get through things without going through regulatories and got complacent. We got our hand slapped where we literally had to place competitor systems in our hospitals so they could run that assay, and eventually that business was eroding. That was the same time in 2012 when [[Danaher]] acquired Beckman for $6.8 billion.

### How would you describe Beckman, pre-acquisition?

Scott Garrett and his people were like a good old boys’ club. He picked his people, everything was closed doors and nothing was transparent. Sales had no idea what was going on at the top or how they were doing things. They were grappling with manufacturing a smaller chemistry analyzer out of China because it was cheaper. All the quality that came from Dr Arnold Beckman and the Coulter franchise, started eroding after he passed away in 1997. If you were part of the good old boys’ club, they protected you and moved you up and so forth. They valued culture and experience and if you were in the field for 27 years, they took care of you. They valued that experience with the customer and kept some of the older folks around knowing they were the ones who had the relationships which is extremely valuable. They were doing the selling and they worked with them, even though they didn't want to do some of the newer computerized things because they were older folks, but it was nice to have that culture and they compensated people well.

### When you say eroding, do you mean the culture and that they were hiring people who didn't align with the traditional culture or was market share also eroding?

Market share eroded due to lower quality and Scott Garrett being a bad leader. He was simply trying to hit the mark so he could get his bonuses, and the board of directors kicked him out after the troponin issue. He was one of the top corporate pays in the US.

### When [[Danaher]] purchased the business, how were you introduced to DBS?

[[Danaher]] Business Systems is 120 tools for manufacturing, process improvements, management systems and some sales. This was their biggest acquisition in healthcare, which they had no experience in. They tried to rally everybody to [[Danaher]] Business Systems and got a lot of resistance in the first few years. They were introducing us to Kaizen and problem-solving strategies to find the root causes of some of the issues we were having. There was also a set of tools we used for customers to help them with process improvements. They picked certain people to be certified at certain levels with these tools, and I was one who was eager to learn many of these management tools. They had daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly management systems to ensure we were hitting our goals and targets.

### What does daily management look like?

Everything was derived from the Toyota lean process and is all about being able to look at a one-page, color-coded chart, and know if you were doing well or poorly. The daily system would be your metrics and it would be green or red, so management could walk by and look at the daily metrics that pertain to their operations and ask questions. They used the 5Y process to figure out why a metric was down that day, which is how [[Danaher]] works.

### Can we walk through an example of DBS in action, more on the commercial side during the sales process? How was DBS implemented post-acquisition?

Prior to [[Danaher]], sales people and lower management could not solve problems. [[Danaher]] involved everybody with their Kaizen concept, which brings key individuals from all parts of the process into a room who collectively solve that problem. Pre-[[Danaher]], we would get a monthly or quarterly report like most companies would, and we found issues and would work on them. Post-[[Danaher]], everybody understood what those issues were and many of us were involved in problem solving.

Post-acquisition, I was promoted to the automation sales management position and was involved in many Kaizens to solve shipping problems, put the right systems in or find missing parts. We would set up a Kaizen event to figure out the root cause, and manufacturing, delivery and sales were involved. We would go through the entire process to figure out where issues arose and how to resolve them. We used Salesforce to look at our funnels in order to forecast better than before. I was part of some problem solving, but if there was a major problem with delivery or manufacturing, we would go through those exercises with the team.

The first few years were frustrating as there was no accountability. We would spend a week doing these exercises but nothing would happen, so I stopped going and told my director I no longer wanted to waste my time. He agreed because it seemed like we were practicing Kaizen, but nobody was held accountable to drive it, so it fell apart. At the top of the [[Danaher]] Business System is a director who is in charge of where these tools are allocated and how we're supposed to be using them and the training that goes with it. I was there five years post-acquisition and I recently spoke to a colleague who said it's still not fixed. [[Danaher]] never understood that some of those tools were for manufacturing. They were trying to push a cube into a round hole which did not fit, and we needed a different approach.

### Why would it be different for healthcare products versus industrial?

I mean the manufacturing side of the business versus the sales side. Some of those tools were designed to problem solve issues in manufacturing, not for sales forecasting.

### They claim to have a commercial tool set mainly for the sales process; how did you see those commercial tools being implemented?

Several DBS tools were part of the sales organization, which we would use with our big accounts to either clean up their mess or give them a better process. We would tell them, with Beckman, you get all these add-ons as a way of life.

### Taking a step back to look at the old sales process, there is an upfront instrument sale after which you sell reagents, either on a fixed volume per year or pay-as-you-go; did DBS change that in any way?

The sales acquisition types, whether it be purchase, reagent rental or lease, didn't change because DBS had nothing to do with that. It was for continuous improvements and problem solving, internally and externally on the commercial side, and didn't affect the funnel.

### Was there no way to get more customers in the funnel or move them through the process quicker? DBS claims to have tools like transformative marketing, value selling, lead nurturing, funnel management and strategic negotiations.

They have all of that but it depends who is implementing them. The sales people, at the time, were trying to sell stuff and this was too complicated. It is all about relationships and I kept laughing at that part. They had programs to bring people right out of college and they replaced senior people who sold because of their trust relationship with customers. These young people didn't know what they were talking about but were tenacious and worked around the clock. They missed the mark there because that younger generation wouldn't stay more than a year or two anyway. They were trying to mold them to follow the DBS tools, but it was a huge disconnect even with them because they didn't understand how to apply the tools.

### What was the rationale for [[Danaher]] getting rid of the more senior people?

Beckman was a good old boys’ club, whereas the culture of [[Danaher]] is a machine that grinds you up and spits you out. Larry Culp retired at the age of 52. He is at GE now but who retires at 52? Some people work into their 80s because they have a passion. Larry was the CEO since inception so it's like, why would you want to; it simply crumbles them.

### Why does it crumble them?

Because it's a machine like the Matrix which has no soul. The system was derived from Toyota where it was designed for manufacturing and problem solving, and they were trying to bring it into healthcare which is a beast, especially in the clinical laboratory business.

### Why not?

It has changed but during those years, it was all about relationships. When you have a relationship with someone for 10 years in a territory, they will buy from you no matter how crappy your product is, unless you really mess up. One of the guys was with Beckman for 27 years in a territory and had lunch with everyone and their families knew each other. The last month he said he was retiring, everyone in that territory purchased the last product from him and there was nothing else to sell for another five years because they bought from him. You are talking about scientists, not business acquisition executives.

### Could you say the same about their industrial businesses with engineers?

Yes; people are people.

### They claim to have had huge incremental improvement post-acquisition?

They acquire many companies and simply add markets where things fit. They are doing a lot of that and improving them, but they are not iterating. Incremental improvements are what they believe in, which is what [[Danaher]] Business Systems does. If you want to grind yourself to death and be 5% better year over year, then [[Danaher]] is for you. Everybody I know no longer works there, whereas prior to [[Danaher]], people were there for 30 to 40 years.

### What is it that makes people leave?

It's a dehumanized machine that, no matter how well you do, eventually you will break down. It is all based on performance metrics and that level of keeping up. Some of my colleagues have aged; I saw 26-year-olds at ACC and thought they were 38. I am 51 and feel like I left at the right time. The older generation realized that it had no soul.

### What were your KPIs when you were selling hematology machines?

KPIs are all about moving the sales process along to all the key stakeholders, so we had to make many little clicks from each stage to say a person says they're in, then move on.

### Who would you approach to buy a hematology machine?

The account managers – who have smaller chunks of territory – have the relationships and sell all the products. Behind them are product specialists and business managers.

### Do they find a lab manager?

Yes, our interaction is generally with the lab managers or directors.

### Who is the buyer once you find the lab manager?

The lab manager/director used to be the buyer, but you also have to convince the techs and supervisors that this would make their lives better and easier. Nowadays, that has changed and become corporatized. You have IDNs where the lab manager has some input but it is sold at the top, as it is relative to what they can save for the system, which is trickled down. Sometimes lab managers from all system hospitals are involved, and sometimes they aren't.

### Has that changed the competitiveness of Beckman?

Roche and Abbott do much better at corporate levels and, for some reason, Beckman wasn't doing a great job being at the top. We sold to directors and labs individually, whereas Roche did a much better job selling to systems to have sole source, and suddenly 50 hospitals would be Roche. Once [[Danaher]] came in, the whole thing was restructured to focus more on IDN levels and GPOs, so it started to get better. For many years, even when I was there, Beckman's marketing was terrible, and it is still archaic today.

### What type of marketing? People on the ground or above the line?

The marketing department who were marketing our products and doing all the brochures, presentations and value propositions, were terrible at it.

### Do you mean the content?

Yes, because they were telling us what the value proposition was and they built the presentations and content and trained us on how to sell that.

### The specialist should be the one that goes in to the account?

Marketing dictates to specialists what they can and cannot say, from a regulatory perspective, so they have a handle on training us how to sell and were simply terrible at it.

### Did that improve under [[Danaher]]?

No, not at all. Our hope was that it would but it didn't improve at all. Everybody who was there when I was there are gone, from the president to VPO of global.

### You were still there for five years though?

They were there for five years.

### Five years is a decent chunk of time?

These days it is for sure, but when I was leaving, I called John and expected him to stop me and say the things he usually said to me, but he said he didn't blame me. He had already accepted a position at Aventis, but didn't tell me at that time, and he left a month before I did and I gave him four months’ notice. Dave Varner follows John wherever he goes and then my directors were gone, because you can only handle Danaher for so long. It beats you down and ages you, which is what I mean by dehumanizing the workplace; it's a machine.

### Is it because it's so structured?

Machines have a succinct way of doing things systematically and consistently, which is what Danaher expects from you with all these systems. We have emotions, kids and families and we break down. They got a bunch of single college kids without families, who can carry that for a couple years, but even they went, no thanks. The turnover rate is pretty large.

### What was the market share of Beckman in some of those product lines and sectors you were working in, prior to Danaher?

In 1997, they acquired the Coulter account and hematology had 90% market share but they messed with it over the years. They kept trying to cut corners and, by the time I came in 10 years later, we were at 60%. They tried to revive it with the DxH but it was a disaster. Their market share went down to, at best, 30% and Sysmex came in with great systems, reliability and much more functionality and took it away from Beckman for two decades. Danaher couldn't fix that; in fact, they made it worse because they don't innovate. Tom Joyce downgraded the company cars that we were on the road in 90% of the time.

### What cars were they?

Managers had Ford Explorers and even the sales reps had decent cars. That was how they were treated because Beckman saw sales as the face of the company and gave you amenities to do your job comfortably. Tom Joyce thought yoga was a waste of time. He was an old school guy who looked at metrics and didn't see that humans needed comfort and leadership to inspire them. I had to leave as that was not the type of leadership I needed.

### They obviously have a separate R&D budget but do they not spend in the right places or is it simply not the right people? Why are they not innovative?

It was puzzling to me too with all the money they could bring and their successes. Their ideology and philosophy were wrong from the beginning. I could write and publish an article about lean processes as I studied it while doing many customer-focused improvements. I discovered that Danaher and most American corporations put the lean process on steroids. The Toyota lean process was to improve efficiencies so humans have more time for creativity. The service organization started putting metrics on people who could do 30 fixes per month, which meant they had to get out of bed daily at the same time and hit their metrics 365 days. God forbid if they got sick or had family issues and could not hit their metric. Danaher Business Systems also started leaning people instead of processes.

### Can you give us a granular example of a lean process you were advised to implement on the customer side of things, in hematology?

This didn't apply to the customer side of things. We had no business leaning the customer; they would tell us to go to hell. The tools we used for customers helped to improve their process. The Five S's helped them declutter, remove steps and automate, so they can have the efficiency and capacity to do other things such as be creative, or not hire as many people. Danaher Business Systems applied metrics to its own people to lean the system.

### How did your life change under Danaher in terms of the metrics or goals you had to hit daily, and did that make you sell more machines or reagents?

Danaher tried, but at the end of every year, we weren't improving but sustaining. Every year, at sales meetings, we were presented as having increased by 0.2%. We had these monthly war rooms which I'm not sure are still happening.

### They call them price war rooms?

Yes, and the war rooms were led by John and Dave and were absolutely stupid. Managers would be shimmering two weeks before trying to prepare for this, and I would tell them they were taking their managers out of the field and yelling at them during war rooms, some of them were demoralized so how was that effective? I was at a conference and John sat next to me and asked me a question about this. They had invited me to several war rooms which I had sat through and I thought they were the stupidest dumbest way of spending time.

The idea of the war room was to create possibilities for the top sales that have to happen now. It was like, what can we do to help you remove obstacles? If it was a price cut, then why? Some people got cancer it was so rough in there, so John asked me what I thought and I told him it was the stupidest thing I had ever seen. I thought he would fire me but we were good friends and he valued that honesty. I said John, what the hell are you doing? I could talk to him like that. He was spending months of his time with these managers but he was the global VP. I asked him what he was doing hazing people and asking questions, that was the directors' job. It was their jurisdiction, managers and sales people and they should be doing that with them. The whole format was ill-managed at the time and very uninspiring. People were scared and it was not a good way of leadership.

### Was there any improvement in financial performance, in terms of margin?

When do you do well when you're scared?

### With typical big acquisitions, you cut the back office and admin roles, so you cut a lot of slack out of the cost base, which improves margins.

That is what Danaher did in the first few years, simply cleaned everything. They got rid of everything, and to their point, there was a lot of redundancy with Beckman. Many people were sitting around who shouldn't have been there and were more problematic.

### Did they cut the cost down in the first few years?

Not only cost, they also got rid of many problem people who were causing problems or were inhibitive to the business. Once they leaned that, they started implementing Danaher Business Systems, which I liked but it was misbalanced. They did not give the people inside the capacity they needed to imagine and day dream. John was in 220 different countries in 365 days, so he couldn't be effective. Warren Buffett has nothing in his black book and does not book himself out every hour, because he needs time to imagine.

### How can you balance the rigorous focus on improvement which is clearly beneficial to the business, with the day dreaming and creative side?

For sales, it was not that hard as they had their own schedules, so they could be creative. All the extra metrics they threw at us which we had to do throughout the day is similar to the new way of healthcare with all the metrics doctors have to do. Doctors were quitting left and right because they were spending half their time filling in forms. Forms are great and you have all this information, transparency and traceability so you can go to any hospital and they have your record, but there has to be a balance.

The people in service were being drained. They cut so many heads and introduced metrics to perform to 100% capacity. That meant you had to handle an entire territory on your own and they were breaking. Reliability issues were really bad but sales were okay. Marketing, service and implementation teams suffered and those are the heart of the company which keep all the customers happy.

### You mentioned how the Coulter core business lost market share; what about the other sectors you worked in or the other systems you worked with?

Hematology suffered and still does and I don't know how they will turn it around. They did several stupid things which I blame on ego. Danaher see their stocks are always good, so they must be awesome.

### What happened in hematology?

In 2012, they ended a 25-year relationship with IL (Instrumentation Laboratory) who had come up with the most amazing coagulation system that meant we were replacing incumbents left and right, really killing it. In my region alone in two years, we replaced so many of them that they fired the sales rep. The VPs started to circle going out to see what the hell was going on. They wanted to purchase IL and I said we were not for sale. Tom Joyce's ego said we didn't need IL and got rid of them. Today they do not have coags, which is important to the portfolio as you can do everything for them.

### Danaher cut the IL relationship that was crucial to the coagulation system?

That was the only coag we had, yes.

### Danaher tried to buy IL but it wasn't for sale, so they cut the relationship?

IL were scrambling as they didn't have a sales force in America, so they tried to hire many of us into their system and 70% of the sales specialists left with IL. It's a wonderful company with amazing people.

### Where did they all go?

IL scrambled and started their own marketing sales organization. The marketing team, left at Beckman, who were selling IL products, had to choose. At that point they promised me automation sales manager which I always wanted, so I stayed because that was appealing.

### With no coagulation product they must have lost a big part of the business?

They lost that part of the portfolio.

### Was that 10% to 15% of the revenue?

Yes, it was 10%. Chemistry is the biggest, then hematology, so IL wasn't huge. If you have a choice between four companies and three of them can give you a total lab solution, that's not where you want to be.

### Why did they cut that relationship if it was working?

Tom Joyce didn't want to have a relationship if IL wouldn't sell to him. IL was an independent global company who refused to sell, so Tom Joyce ended it without negotiation. They did the same thing in automation. They had the most successful automation system worldwide by partnering with a Japanese group called IDS. 10 years ago, they decided to do their own, and two years ago they announced that would do their automation in-house. The latest news is that it has many problems and bugs, which we worked out 20 years ago. We had a solid product we were selling which was ahead of any competitor product, so why would they end something that good? They keep doing that, and it was much cheaper to build it in-house, but we will see what happens in the next few years.

### Was that the same with IL? It was expensive in the relationship you had?

IL is one of the most sophisticated and we were more expensive than competitors. We never sold on price but always sold on quality and they had a better menu than others.

### Was Tom Joyce not close to the technical product and the relationship and simply wanted to look at price, because obviously Danaher have loads of products?

Their philosophy is to cut waste as much as possible and forget about innovation. They simply want to milk over 200 of their companies.

### How about the other sectors you mentioned; hematology was struggling?

Hematology was completely destroyed from where it was to where we are today. I still go into labs, and even the ones I see with DxHs are getting rid of them.

### Why is that?

Reliability, even when I was there, was bad; it was breaking them.

### What drives reliability?

With all the Danaher Business Systems and manufacturing, that was a puzzle they couldn't or didn't want to fix. You have to start from scratch, which is an expensive business proposition, so they tried their best, spent a lot of money and involved many hats to figure out the problems, but the entire infrastructure of the DxH from the ground up was bad. You can put so many tapes on it, but essentially, that whole platform has to be rethought.

### The Coulter business declined market share from 90% to 30%, in hematology?

When I left, it was 50% and it has continued to decline, so don't quote me on 30%.

### But it has declined anyway?

Yes, it was a huge decline. They lost coag and the only thing they are surviving on is chemistry and immunoassay, but immunoassay is a fight without infectious disease. For 15 years, we were like, go get infectious disease, but they either didn't want to spend the money or didn't see the value of buying the rights to infectious disease assays.

### Did they not see a need to spend money for the rights or buy a company?

People wanted $4 billion for the rights to sell four assays, so they said no thanks. Internally development was so slow or simply couldn't get around the patents or something. Maybe they were waiting until the patents ran out but they have to hold every account by their teeth until they can get there.

### What synergies are there with Danaher's other business, such as Leica?

We talked about it, but when you talk about mass spec, AB Sciex, the sales people who sell hematology, don't care about that because they are trying to survive. Unless they could find a way to bundle them because the customer wants AB Sciex, they would not source that at this price and win over competition; there was almost no synergy with the companies.

### Not with Leica or Radiometer?

Radiometer a little but laboratories are so segmented that micro has no idea what's going on in chemistry. Sales is barely trained to do chemistry and has no idea of micro.

### Is there no account manager who sits between them, at the account level?

They tried to incentivize us with $500 but I didn't care about $500 when I had to sell $4 million of automation. There wasn't as much synergy as you would hope for. Synergy would have been that they would buy a company who had infectious disease.

### How much do hematology or Coulter instruments cost?

Chemistry was between $100,000 to $250,000, depending on the size, and hematology was $100,000 a piece. There is not much margin selling machines; it's in reagents.

### Did they change the price of reagents once Danaher acquired them?

We had to drop it substantially to hold onto the business. We lost tons of margin but got it back several years later. With troponin, we had to give concession and drop everything in-house. Beckman would never budge on price. I remember telling them we were at 80% GP, could you give 10%, and 9 out of 10 times it was no, this is the price, go sell it. Danaher took over and you could get any price. They made a lot of price concessions to keep the business.

### In last year's investor day, they claimed Beckman Diagnostics was growing mid-single digit if not higher single digit; what is driving that?

So we were talking about revenue.

### Yes, I mean top line revenue.

That's all it is in this world. When you look at quarter to quarter, companies are losing billions of dollars and their price valuation is through the roof, because year over year, their revenue is going through the roof, but they're still losing money. Think about innovation and the new Rivian cars, and not too far back, Tesla was about the promise and what it can do innovating to change the world. Beckman is not going to change anything or the world.

### How sticky are these products?

Contracts lock them in for five to seven years. Automation is 10 years and they are bolted to the ground and nobody wants to mess with them as it takes two years to implement. Automation was great because, once you get it in, you're good for 10 years and they will get a lot of juice money from the reagents, which is where the money is. You have a large margin there.

### 80% gross margin?

Yes.

### As these contracts are coming up, are they switching to Roche or Abbott?

Every time there's that potential, so the question is, how do we win that back? Historically, you win those back by having an honest relationship. If you and I have been working together for 10 years and you trusted me for everything and I always showed up for you, your system is not the best, but I know that when I fall down, you're always there for me. This guy is going to sell to me, but I don't know if he'll be around.

### Would you also cut the price of reagents?

We did, yes. When Siemens gave 10% off, so would we.

### What is the biggest challenge?

These are commodities and everybody is doing the same thing.

### If they're commodities why does innovation matter?

Innovation matters because if you have it, that's when your GP goes up. Innovation can replace one person who costs $135,000 a year.

### Is that what Danaher is buying? They see Beckman has sticky five or 10 year relationships and don't care about the product quality so don't invest much in R&D?

Danaher cares about the brands and are all about taking the brands which were number one or two, and bringing them back up to what they were. Danaher's business model is all about big brands who need better management. They are a management tool company who help you get you back up there with efficiencies; that's what they claim to be.

### All these businesses are high quality companies, with sticky relationships.

All of them were, at one point, number one, yes.

### There's obviously a risk of not innovating and missing a new trend?

All they bet on is brand name and tooling them up so they can be sufficient.

### Sustain the brand?

Sustain the brand so they can come up and simply have incremental revenue.

### It still drives good margin because you're getting high margin reagent, so what's the risk of this strategy if you play this for another 10 years with Beckman?

Roche and Siemens are doing the same thing so it would be challenged in our time by someone who is more innovative, like Theranos. Something like that will completely wipe this out. Blockchain systems will decentralize banking and everything else, so we're getting innovative and people are working on it, but it's not going to come from these companies.

### Danaher doesn't care too much because they can keep on acquiring?

They could buy Theranos once it is proven.

### DBS dehumanizes a business but it does drive incremental improvements. What are the potential risks of this system in the long run?

The risk is that someone else, eventually, will innovate the blood-testing world. If it’s someone like Elon Musk, they’re not going to sell to you; they’re going to laugh at you. They’re looking at trillion-dollar companies; they’re not looking at six billion, 30 billion. They’re going to laugh in your face. When someone like that comes along – and they will – that’s the risk. They don’t want your $4 billion acquisition. Because it is more than a trillion-dollar business worldwide, if you can solve the healthcare problem.
