# Munger's Critique of Lawyers, Law Firms, and Litigation

### Demise of Ethics among Law Firms

I never have the slightest interest in defending miscreants and helping them misbehave. But the general view is that it's wonderful what Johnny Cochran did (getting O.J. Simpson off).

### Lawyers butchered the Martha Stewart case
What happened with Martha Stewart was that she heard some news, panicked, and sold the stock. It turns out that if she'd just told the truth, she'd have been okay. But because she had a vague idea that what she'd done was wrong, she had a totally phony story when the investigators came and she lied to them and that's a felony. And she did these facts *after* she'd hired highfalutin' lawyers! And I'm sure they charged her a lot. I do not invent these stories.

Were I her lawyer, I would have said "You know, Martha, that's an interesting story, and I'm your lawyer, so I'm required to believe you, but nobody else will. So, you're going to have to come up with a different story, or you'll have to tell it through a different lawyer because I don't like losing cases." And it will work. It's so simple. Literally, she went to prison for her behavior *after* she'd hired a lawyer!

### The Tort System
What's particularly pernicious is the increasing political power of the plaintiffs' bar. State supreme court judges are generally on for life. The only thing that can jeopardize this is for them to really anger some important group - like the plaintiff's bar. Thus, the judges allow junk science and the like.

Because of the tort system, there are whole areas for the already rich to avoid. For example, a company developed a new, safer, better police helmet but sold the product to a judgment-proof company (because the helmet-developer was afraid of liability). It would be crazy for Berkshire to be in the business of providing security guard at airports. The system discourages the best companies from entering certain businesses.

### Asbestos and Tort Reform
Asbestos has morphed into a situation with enormous amounts of fraud. People with serious injuries are being hurt (as more money flows to the plaintiff's bar and to claimants with no current injuries). The Supreme Court has practically invited Congress to step in, but Congress has refused due to the influence of the trial lawyers. I'd be surprised if there's a constructive solution in the next five years. I expect there will be more of the current mess.

What's happened in asbestos is that a given group of people get mesothelioma - a horrible cancer that comes only from asbestos exposure and kills people. Then, there's another group of claimants who smoked two packs of cigarettes a day and have a spot on their lung. Then you have a lawyer who gets a doctor to testify that every spot is caused by asbestos. Once you effectively bribe a doctor, then you can get millions of people to sue on fears of getting cancer.

But there's not enough money to pay all of the claimants, so people who are truly harmed don't get enough. In a southern state with a jury pool that hates all big companies you get big judgments, but lawyers are stealing money from people who are hurt and giving it to people who aren't entitled. It's a bonkers system, but with the federalism, there's no way to stop it. The Supreme Court refused to step in.

Trying to buy people off is like trying to put out a fire by dousing it with gasoline. With word processors, lawyers can easily produce countless claimants. But only twenty-five percent of the money goes to the claimants - the rest goes to the lawyers, doctors, etc.

If you want to be cynical, look at the perjury. There are only three solvent companies left (facing asbestos claims), so plaintiffs can only remember those three names (when recalling which products they were exposed to decades ago). It's a case of perjury being suborned by practicing lawyers.

The only people who can fix it are the Supreme Court of Congress. The Supreme Court - some people would say rightly - refused to get involved, but I say they chickened out. And Congress, given the politics, has yet to step in.

There's an important lesson here: Once wrongdoers get rich, they get enormous political power and you can't stop it, so the key is to nip things like this in the bud.

It would be easy to fix the problem: the right way is to say we're not going to pay off all these little claims.

### The Government's lawsuit against [[Microsoft]]
[April 2000] Someone whose salary is paid by US taxpayers is happy to dramatically weaken the one place where we're winning big?

Every business tries to turn this year's success into next year's greater success. It's hard for me to see why [[Microsoft]] is sinful to do this. If it's a sin, then I hope all of [[Berkshire Hathaway]]'s subsidiaries are sinners.
