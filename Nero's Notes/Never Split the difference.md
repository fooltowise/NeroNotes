# Never Split The Difference

## By Chris Voss

### Chapter 1: Introduction

- Under Kahneman's System 1 and System 2 model, if you know how to affect your counterpart's System 1 thinking, his inarticulate feelings, by how you frame and deliver your questions and statements, then you can guide his System 2 rationality and therefore modify his responses. That's what happened to my counterpart at Harvard. By asking "How am I supposed to do that?" **I influenced his System 1 emotional mind into accepting that his offer wasn't good enough; his System 2 then rationalized the situation so that it made sense to give me a better offer.**
- What is needed is simple psychological tactics and strategies that work in the filed to calm people down, establish rapport, gain trust, elicit the verbalization of needs, and persuade the other guy of our empathy. We need something easy to teach, and easy to execute.
- It all starts with the universally applicable premise that people want to be understood and accepted. Listening is the cheapest, yet most effective concession we can make to get there. By listening intensely, a negotiator demonstrates empathy and shows a sincere desire to better understand what the other side is experiencing.
- The whole concept which you'll learn as the centerpiece of this book is called *Tactical Empathy*. This is listening as a martial art, balancing the subtle behaviors of emotional intelligence and the assertive skills of influence, to gain access to the mind of another person. **Contrary to popular opinion, listening is not a passive activity. It is the most active thing you can do.**

### Chapter 2:  Be a mirror
The language of negotiation is primarily a language of conversation and rapport: a way of quickly establishing relationships and getting people to talk and think together. Which is why when you think of the greatest negotiator of all times, I've got a surprise for you - think Oprah Winfrey.
Her daily television show was a case study of a master practitioner at work: on a stage face-to-face with someone she has never met, in front of a crowded studio of hundreds, with millions more watching from home, and a task to persuade that person in front of her, sometimes against his or her own best interests, to talk and keep talking, ultimately sharing with the world deep, dark secrets that they had held hostage in their own minds for a lifetime.

Look closely at such an interaction after reading this chapter and suddenly you'll see a refined set of powerful skills: a conscious smile to ease the tension, use of subtle verbal and nonverbal language to signal empathy (and thus security), a certain downward inflection in her voice, embrace of specific kinds of questions and avoidance of others - a whole array of previously hidden skills that will prove invaluable to you, once you've learned to use them.

Here are some of the key lessons from this chapter to remember:
- A good negotiator prepares, going in, to be ready for possible surprises; a great negotiator aims to use her skills to reveal the surprises she is certain to find.
- Don't commit to assumptions; instead, view them as hypotheses  and use the negotiation to test them rigorously.
- People who view negotiation as a battle of arguments become overwhelmed by the choices in their head. Negotiation is not an act of battle; it's a process of discovery. The goal is to uncover as much information as possible.
- To quiet the voices in your head, make your sole and all-encompassing focus the other person and what they have to say.
- Slow. It. Down. Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making. If we're much in a hurry, people can feel as if they're not being heard. You risk undermining the rapport and trust you've built.
- Put a smile on your face. When people are in a positive frame of mind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate and problem-solve (instead of fight and resist). Positivity creates mental agility in both you and your counterpart.

**There are three voices available to negotiators:**
1. **The late-night FM DJ voice: Use selectively to make a point. Inflect your voice downward, keeping it calm and slow. When done properly, you create an aura of authority and trustworthiness without triggering defensiveness.**
2. **The positive/playful voice: Should be your default voice. It's the voice of an easy-going, good-natured person. Your attitude is light and encouraging. The key is to relax and smile while you're talking.**
3. The direct and assertive voice: Used rarely. Will cause problems and create push back.

- **Mirrors work magic. Repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone just said. We fear what's different and are drawn to what's similar. Mirroring is the art of insinuating similarly, which facilitates bonding. Use mirrors to encourage the other side to empathize and bond with you, keep people talking, buy your side time to regroup, and encourage your counterpart to reveal their strategy.**


#### How to confront - and get your way - without confrontation

I only half-jokingly refer to mirroring as magic or a Jedi mind trick because it gives you the ability to disagree without being disagreeable. 
To consider just how useful that can be, think of the average workplace: invariably there is still someone in a position of authority who arrived at this position through aggressive assertiveness ,sometimes outright intimidation, with "old school" top-down, command-and-control assumptions that the boss is always right. And let's not delude ourselves: whatever the enlightened rules of the "new school", in every environment (work or otherwise) you will always have to deal with forceful type A people who prefer consent to collaboration.

If you take a pit bill approach with another pit bull, you generally end up with a messy scene and lots of bruised feelings and resentment. Luckily, there's another way without all the mess.
It's just four simple steps:
1. Use the late night FM DJ voice
2. Start with "I'm sorry..."
3. Mirror
4. Silence. At least four seconds, to let the mirror work its magic on your counterpart.
5. Repeat.

### Chapter 3: Don't feel their pain, label it

As you try to insert the tools of tactical empathy into your daily life, I encourage you to think of them as extensions of natural human interactions and not artificial conversational tics.

In any interaction, it pleases us to feel the other side is listening and acknowledging our situation. Whether you are negotiating a business deal or simply chatting to the person at the supermarket butcher counter; creating an empathetic relationship and encouraging your counterpart to expand on their situation is the basis of healthy human interaction.

These tools, then, are nothing less than emotional best practices that help you cure the pervasive ineptitude that marks our most critical conversations in life. They will help you connect and create more meaningful and warm relationships. That they might help you extract what you want is a bonus. Human connection is the first goal.

With that in mind, I encourage you to take the risk of sprinkling these in every conversation you have. I promise you that they will feel awkward and artificial at first, but keep at it. Learning to walk felt awfully strange, too.

As you internalize these techniques, turning the artifice of tactical empathy into a habit and then into an integral part of your reality, keep in mind these lessons from the chapter you've just read:

- Imagine yourself in your counterpart's situation. The beauty of empathy is that it doesn't demand that you agree with the other person's ideas (you may well find them crazy). But by acknowledging the other person's situation, you immediately convey that you are listening. And once they know that you are listening, they may tell you something you can use.
- The reasons why a counterpart will not make an agreement with you are often more powerful than why they will make a deal, so focus first on clearing the barriers to agreement. Denying barriers or negative influences gives them credence; get them in the open.
- Pause. After you label a barrier or mirror a statement, let it sink in. Don't worry, the other party will fill the silence.
- Label your counterpart's fears to diffuse their power. We all want to talk about the happy stuff, but remember, the faster you interrupt action in your counterpart's amygdala, the part of the brain that generates fear, the faster you can generate feelings of safety, well-being, and trust.
- List the worst thing that the other party could say about you and say them before the other person can. Performing an accusation audit in advance prepares you to head off negative dynamics before they take root. And because these accusations often sound exaggerated when said aloud, speaking them will encourage the other person to claim that quite the opposite is true.
- Remember you're dealing with a person who wants to be appreciated and understood. So use labels to reinforce and encourage positive perceptions and dynamics.

### Chapter 4: Beware "Yes", Master "No"

Using this chapter's tools in daily life is difficult for many people because they go directly against one of society's biggest social dictums. That is, be nice.

We've instrumentalized niceness in a way of greasing the social wheels, yet it's often a ruse. We're polite and we don't disagree to get through daily existence with the least degree of friction. But by turning niceness into a lubricant, we've leeched it of meaning. A smile and a nod might signify "get me out of here!" as much as it means "Nice to meet you."

That's death for a good negotiator, who gains their power by understanding their counterpart's situation and extracting information about their counterpart's desire and needs. Extracting that information means getting the other party to feel safe and in control. And while it may sound contradictory, the way to get there is by getting the other party to disagree, to draw their own boundaries, to define their desires as a function of what they do not want.

As you try to put the chapter's methods to use, I encourage you to think of them as the anti-"niceness ruse". Not in the sense that they are unkind, but in the sense that they are authentic. Triggering "No" peels away the plastic falsehood of "Yes" and gets you to what's really at stake. Along the way, keep in mind these powerful lessons:

- Break the habit of attempting to get people to say "Yes". Being pushed for "yes" makes people defensive. Our love of hearing "yes" makes us blind to the defensiveness we ourselves feel when someone is pushing us to say it.
- "No" is not a failure. We have learned that "no" is the anti-"yes" and therefore a word to be avoided at all costs. But it really often just means "Wait" or "I'm not comfortable with that." Learn how to hear it calmly. It is not the end of the negotiation, but the beginning.
- "Yes" is the final goal of the negotiation, but don't aim for it at the start. Asking someone for "yes" too quickly in a conversation - "do you like to drink water, Mr Smith?" - gets his guard up and paints you as an untrustworthy salesman.
- Saying "no" makes the speaker feel safe, secure, and in control, so trigger it. By saying what they don't want, your counterpart defines their space and gains the confidence and comfort to listen to you. That's why "Is now a bad time to talk?" is always better than "Do you have a few minutes to talk?"
- Sometimes the only way to get your counterpart to listen and engage with you is by forcing them into a "no". That means intentionally mislabeling one of their emotions or desires or asking a ridiculous question - like "It seems like you want this project to fail" - that can only be answered negatively.
- Negotiate in their world. Persuasion is not about how bright or smooth or forceful you are. It's about the other party convincing themselves that the solution you want is their own idea. So don't beat them with logic or brute force. Ask them questions that open paths to your goals. It's not about you.
- If a potential business partner is ignoring you, contact them with a clear and concise "no"-oriented question that suggests that you are ready to walk away. "Have you given up on this project?" works wonders.

### Chapter 5: Trigger the Two Words

"Sleeping in the same bed and dreaming different dreams" is an old Chinese expression that describes the intimacy of partnership (whether in marriage or business) without the communication necessary to sustain it.

Such is the recipe for bad marriages and bad negotiations.
With each party having its own set of objectives, its own goals and motivations, the truth is that the conversational niceties - the socially lubricating "yeses" and "You're rights" that get thrown out fast and furious early in any interaction - are not in any way a substitute for real understanding between you and your partner.

The power of getting to that understanding, and not to some simple "yes", is revelatory in the art of negotiation. The moment you've convinced someone that you truly understand her dreams and feelings (the whole world that she inhabits), mental and behavioral change becomes possible, and the foundation for a breakthrough has been laid.

Use these lessons to lay that foundation:
- Creating unconditional positive regard opens the door to changing thoughts and behaviors. Humans have an innate urge toward socially constructive behavior. The more a person feels understood, and positively affirmed in that understanding, the more likely that urge for constructive behavior will take hold.
- "That's right" is better than "yes". Strive for it. Reaching "that's right" in a negotiation creates breakthroughs.
- USe a summary to trigger a "that's right". The building blocks of a good summary are a label combined with paraphrasing. Identify, re-articulate, and emotionally affirm "the world according to..."

### Chapter 6: Bend their reality

Compared to the tools discussed in previous chapters, the techniques here seem concrete and easy to use. But many people shay away from them because they seem manipulative. Something that bends your counterpart's reality mush be cheating, right?

In response, let me just say that these tools are used by all the best negotiators because they simply recognize the human psyche as it is. We are emotional, irrational beasts who are emotional an irrational in predictable, pattern-filled ways. Using that knowledge is only, well, rational.

As you work these tools into your daily life, remember the following powerful lessons:
- All negotiations are defined by a network of subterranean desires and needs. Don't let yourself be fooled by the surface. Once you know that the Haitian kidnappers just want party money, you will be miles better prepared.
- Splitting the difference is wearing one black and one brown shoe, so don't compromise. Meeting halfway often leads to bad deals for both sides.
- Approaching deadlines entice people to rush the negotiating process and do impulsive things that are against their best interests.
- The F-word - "Fair" - is an emotional term people usually exploit to put the other side on the defensive and gain concessions. When your counterpart drops the F-bomb, don't get suckered into a concession. Instead, ask them to explain how you're mistreating them.
- You can bend your counterpart's reality by anchoring his starting point. Before you make an offer, emotionally anchor them by saying how bad it will be. When you get to numbers, set an extreme anchor to make your *real* offer seem reasonable, or use a range to seem less aggressive. The real value of anything depends on what vantage point you're looking at it from.
- People will take more risks to avoid a loss than to realize a gain. Make sure your counterpart sees that there is something to lose by inaction.


### Chapter 7: Create the illusion of control

Who has control in a conversation, the guy listening or the guy talking? 

The listener, of course.
That's because the talker is revealing information while the listener, if he's trained well, is directing the conversation toward his own goals. He's harnessing the talker's energy for his own ends.
When you try to work the skills from this chapter into your daily life, remember that these are listener's tools. They are not about strong-arming your opponent into submission. Rather, they're about using the counterpart's power to get to your objective. They're listener's judo. 

As you put listener's judo into practice, remember the following powerful lessons:
- Don't try to force your opponent to admit that you are right. Aggressive confrontation is the enemy of constructive negotiation.
- Avoid questions that can be answered with "yes" or tiny pieces of information. These require little thought and inspire the human need for reciprocity; you will be expected to give something back.
- Ask calibrated questions that start with the words "how" or "what". By implicitly asking the other party for help, these questions will give your counterpart an illusion of control and will inspire them to speak at length, revealing important information.
- Don't ask questions that start with "why" unless you want your counterpart to defend a goal that serves you. "Why" is always an accusation, in any language.
- Calibrate your questions to point your counterpart toward solving your problem. This will encourage them to expend their energy on devising a solution.
- Bite your tongue. When you're attacked in a negotiation, pause and avoid angry emotional reactions. Instead, ask your counterpart a calibrated question.
- There is always a team on the other side. If you are not influencing those behind the table, you are vulnerable.



### Chapter 8: Guarantee Execution

Superstar negotiators - real rainmakers - know that a negotiation is a playing field beneath the words, where really getting to a good deal involves detecting and manipulating subtle, non-obvious signals beneath the surface. It is only by visualizing and modifying these sub-surfaces issues that you can draft a great deal and make sure that it is implemented.

As you put the following tools to use, remember this chapter's most important concept. That is, "Yes" is another "How". Asking "How", knowing "How", and defining "How" are all part of the effective negotiator's arsenal. He would be unarmed without them.

- Ask calibrated "how" questions, and ask them again and again. Asking "how" keeps your counterparts engaged but off balance. Answering the questions will give them the illusions of control. It will also lead to contemplate your problems when making their demands.
- Use "How" questions to shape the negotiating environment. You do this by using "How can I do that?" as a gentle version of "no". This will subtly push your counterpart to search for other solutions - *your* solutions. And very often it will get them to bid against themselves.
- Don't just pay attention to the people you're negotiating with directly; always identify the motivations of the players "behind the table". You can do so by asking how a deal will affect everybody else and how on board they are.
- Follow the 7-38-55 Percent rule by paying close attention to tone of voice and body language. Incongruence between the words and nonverbal signs will show when your counterpart is lying or uncomfortable with a deal.
- Is the "Yes" real or counterfeit? Test it with the Rule of Three: use calibrated questions, summaries, and labels to get your counterpart to reaffirm their agreement at least three times. It's really hard to repeatedly lie or fake conviction.
- A person's use of pronouns offers deep insights into his or her relative authority. If you're hearing a lot of "I", "me", and "my", the real power  to decide probably lies elsewhere. Picking up a lot of "we", "they", and "them", it's more likely you're dealing directly with a savvy decision maker keeping his options open.
- Use your own name to make yourself a real person to the other side and even get your own personal discount. Humor and humanity are the best ways to break the ice and remove roadblocks.

### Chapter 9: Bargain Hard

When push comes to shove - and it will - you're going to find yourself sitting across the table from a bare-knuckle negotiator. After you've finished all the psychologically nuanced stuff - the labeling and mirroring and calibrating -  you are going to have to hash out the "brass tacks."

For most of us, that ain't fun.

Top negotiators know, however, that conflict is often the path to great deals. And the best find ways to actually have fun engaging in it. Conflict brings out truth, creativity, and resolution. So the next time you find yourself face-to-face with a bare-knuckle bargainer, remember the lessons in this chapter.

- Identify your counterpart's negotiation style. Once you know whether they are Accomodator, Assertive, or Analyst, you'll know to correct the way to approach them.
- Prepare, prepare, prepare. When the pressure is on, you don't rise to the occasion. You fall to your highest level of preparation. So design an ambitious but legitimate goal and then game out the labels, calibrated questions, and responses you'll use to get there. That way, once you're at the bargaining table, you won't have to wing it.
- Get ready to take a punch. Kick-ass negotiators usually lead with an extreme anchor to knock you off your game. If you're not ready, you'll flee to your maximum without a fight. So prepare your dodging tactics to avoid getting sucked into the compromise trap.
- Set boundaries, and learn to take a punch or punch back, without anger. The guy across the table is not the problem; the situation is.
- Prepare an Ackerman plan. Before you head into the weeds of bargaining, you'll need a plan of extreme anchor, calibrated questions, and well-defined offers. Remember: 65, 85, 95, 100 percent. Decreasing raises and ending  on non-round numbers will get your counterpart to believe that he's squeezing you for all you're worth when you're really getting to the number you want.


### Chapter 10: Find the Black Swan

What we don't know can kill us or our deals. But uncovering it can totally change the course of a negotiation and bring us unexpected success.

Finding the Black Swans - those powerful *unknown unknowns* is intrinsically difficult, however, for the simple reason that we don't know the questions to ask. Because we don't know what the treasure is, we don't know where to dig.

Here are some of the best techniques for flushing out the Black Swans - and exploiting them. Remember, your counterpart might not even know how important the information is, or even that they shouldn't reveal it. So keep pushing, probing, and gathering information.

- Let what you know - your known knowns - guide you but not blind you. Every case is new, so remain flexible and adaptable. Remember the Griffin bank crisis: no hostage-taker had killed an hostage on deadline, until he did.
- Black Swans are leverage multipliers. Remember the three types of leverage: positive (the ability to give someone what they want); negative (the ability to hurt someone); and normative (using your counterpart's norms to bring them around).
- Work to understand the other side's "religion". Digging into worldviews inherently implies moving beyond the negotiating table and into the life, emotional and otherwise, of your counterpart. That's where Black Swans live.
- Review everything you hear from your counterpart. You will not hear everything the first time, so double-check. Compare notes with team members. Use backup listeners whose job is to listen between the lines. They will hear things you miss.
- Exploit the similarity principle. People are more apt to concede to someone they share a cultural similarity with, so dig for what makes them tick and show that you share common ground.
- When someone seems irrational or crazy, they most likely aren't. Faced with this situation, search for constraints, hidden desires, and bad information.
- Get face time with your counterpart. Ten minutes of face time often reveals more than days of research. Pay special attention to your counterpart's verbal and nonverbal communication at unguarded moments - at the beginning and the end of the session or when someone says something out of line.
