Given my [[Workview Reflection]] and my [[Lifeview Reflection]], I can now see my **True North** emerging:

- I want my work to provide value to people so that i can leave this place in a better shape than I received it.
- The way to make work pleasant/fulfilling is to be often in a state of flow. This implies a hefty dose of creative work where I can apply personal insights to create value.
- This can either be done at a small scale (my local community) or at a large scale by using leverage (internet, capital, intellectual property, ...).
