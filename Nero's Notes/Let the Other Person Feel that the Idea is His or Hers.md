# Let the Other Person Feel that the Idea is His or Hers

Don't try to ram your opinion into the throat of other people. It is wiser to make suggestions - and let the other people think out the conclusion.

No one likes to feel that he or she is being sold something or being told what to do. We much prefer to feel that we are buying of our own accord or acting on our own ideas. We like to be consulted about our wants, our thoughts, our wishes.

Example: 

> Our factory has recently completed a new line of X-ray equipment. The first shipment of these machines has just arrived at our office. They are not perfect. We know that, and we want to improve them. So we should be deeply obligated to you if you could find time to look them over and give us your ideas about how they can be made more serviceable to your profession. Knowing how occupied you are, I shall be glad to send my car for you at any hour you specify.
