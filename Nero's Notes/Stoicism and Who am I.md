# Stoicism and Who am I

> A person who deosn't know what the universe is, doesn't know where they are. A person who doesn't know their purpose in life doesn't know who they are or what the universe is. A person who doesn't know any of these doesn't know why they are here. So what to make of people who seek or avoid the praise of those who have no knowledge of where or who they are? Marcus Aurelius, _Meditations_

I should get clarity of who I am and what I stand for.
Otherwise, how could I know what I should chase and what I should say no to?
