## System with 2 competing balancing loops (ex: thermostat)

![[SystemsWithTwoCompetingBalancingLoops.png]]


It's important to note that the information delivered by a feedback loop- even a non-physical one - can only impact the future behavior of the [[System Thinking| system]]. The loop cannot deliver a signal quickly enough to correct the behavior that triggered the current feedback.

A feedback loop whose purpose is to maintain a stock level at a desired level must have its goal correctly setup, including inflows and outflows processes impacting the stock as well. Otherwise, the feedback mechanism will either fall short or be in excess and the stock level reached will be either too low or too high.

## System with one balancing loop and one reinforcing loop (ex: population)

![[SystemsWithBalancingAndReinforcingLoop.png]]


This type of system can only have three possible behaviors:

- If the reinforcing loop is stronger than the balancing loop, the system will grow exponentially
- if the balancing loop is stronger than the reinforcing loop, the system will contract
- if both loops are equally strong, the stock will be in dynamic equilibrium, inflows = outflows

We can as well have a succession over time of these three configurations

## System with a renewable stock constrained by a non-renewable stock (ex: oil economy)

Any physical system will a growing stock will sooner or later encounter a constraint. This limit will have the shape of a balancing loop that shifts the dominance of the reinforcing loop, either by decreasing inflows or by increasing outflows.

In exponentially growing systems, there must be at least one reinforcing loop that drives the growth, and at lest one balancing loop constraining the growth, because systems can't grow forever in a finite environment.

General behavior of the system:

![[BehaviorStockConstrained.png]]

A quantity growing exponentially (here capital) toward a limit or constraint will reach this limit in a surprisingly short time. Doubling available resources will only shortly delay the time to reach the limit (see the 72 rule: if growth is 10% per year, then doubling resources will only delay hitting the limit by 7 years)

## System with a renewable stock constraint by a renewable stock (ex: fishing economy)

Depending on the relative strength of feedback loops, we can observe three kind of behavior for this system:

- overshoot, then sustainable equilibrium
- overshoot of this equilibrium then oscillations
- overshoot, then collapse of the resource and the industry relying on it

The chosen scenario depends on two factors:
- the critical threshold beyond which the regenerating capacity of the resource is damaged
- The celerity of the feedback loop and its effectiveness to slow capital growth when the resource is seriously depleted.

**Non-renewable resources are stock-limited.** The whole stock is available at once, and can be extracted at any rate (only limited by the extraction capital). But as it is not renewed, the highest the extraction rate, the shortest the lifetime of the resource.

**Renewable resources are flow-limited.** They can support an extraction for an indefinite time, but only if the extraction rate (the outflow) is lower than its regeneration rate. If these resources are extracted faster than they can regenerate, they will decrease below a critical threshold and become, for all practical purpose, non-renewable.
