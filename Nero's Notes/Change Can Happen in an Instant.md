# Change Can Happen in an Instant

Why is it that most people think change takes so long? One reason, obviously, is that most people have tried again and again through willpower to make changes, and failed. The assumption that they then make is that important changes must take a long time and be very difficult  to make. In reality, it's only difficult because most of us don't know how to change. We don't have an effective strategy. Willpower by itself is not enough - not if we want to achieve lasting change.

**Once we effect a change we should reinforce it immediately. Then, we have to condition our nervous systems to succeed not just once, but consistently.** You wouldn't go to an aerobic class just one time and say, "Okay, now I've got a great body and I'll be healthy for life!" The same is true of your emotions and behavior. We've got to condition ourselves for success, for love, for breaking through our fears. And through that conditioning, we can develop patterns that automatically lead us to consistent, lifetime success.

We need to remember that pain and pleasure shape all our behaviors, and that pain and pleasure can *change* our behaviors. Conditioning requires  that we understand how to use pain and pleasure.

**Neuro-Associative Conditioning (NAC) is a step-by-step process that can condition your nervous system to associate pleasure to those things you want to continuously move toward and pain to those things you need to avoid in order to succeed consistently in your life without constant effort or willpower.** Remember, it's the feelings that we've been conditioned to associate in our nervous systems - our neuro-associations - that determine our emotions and our behavior. When we take control of our neuro-associations, we take control of our life.

**The first belief we must have if we're going to create change quickly is that we can change now.**

**The second belief that you and I must have if we're going to create long-term change is that we're responsible for our own change, not anyone else.** In fact, there are three specific beliefs about responsibility that a person must have if they're going to create long-term changes.

**First, we must believe, "Something must change"** - not that it should change, not that it could or ought to, but that it absolutely must. 
**Second, we must not only believe that things must change, but we must believe, "I must change it."** We must see ourselves as the source of the change. Otherwise, we'll always be looking for someone else to make the changes for us, and we'll always have someone else to blame when it doesn't work out.
**Third, we must believe "I can change it."** Without believing that it's possible for us to change, we stand no change of carrying through on our desires.

**In the end, you have to be the source of your change.**
