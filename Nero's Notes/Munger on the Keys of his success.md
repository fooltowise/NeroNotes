# Munger on the Keys of his success

1. It is occasionally possible for a tortoise, content to assimilate insights of his best predecessors, to outrun hares that seek originality or don't wish to be left out of some crowd folly that ignores the best work of the past. This happens as the tortoise stumbles on some particularly effective way to apply the best previous work, or simply avoids standard calamities. We try more to profit from always remembering the obvious that from grasping the esoteric. **It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.**
2. We don't claim to have perfect morals, but at least we have a huge area of things that, while legal, are beneath us. We won't do them. Currently, there's a culture in America that says that anything that won't send you in prison is okay. We believe there should be a huge area between everything you should do and everything you can do without getting into legal trouble. I don't think you should come anywhere near that line. We don't deserve much credit for this. It helps to make more money. I'd like to believe that we'd behave well even if it didn't work. But more often, we've made extra money from doing the right thing.
3. Remember Louis Vincenti's rule: tell the truth, and you won't have to remember your lies. It's such a simple concept.
