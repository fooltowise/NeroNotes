# Boosting Income using one-time or unsustainable revenues

### Boosting income using one-time events

- If a company sells a subsidiary, check that it is not included in the operating income. Ex:  IBM sold a subsidiary to AT&T  and included that gain as a reduction of SG&A
- Some companies turn the sale of a business into a revenue stream: **Be sure to always review both parties'disclosures on the sale  of business to best grasp the true economics of the transaction.** Ex: Intel sold certain of its assets to Marvell, while Marvell agreed to purchase a minimum number of semiconductor wafers to Intel *at an  inflated price.*
- Beware of commingling the sale of a business with the sale of a product: some companies do that to report a lower one-time sale BUT larger future stream of revenue...
- Watch for changes in accounting policies that accelerate the recognition of income: these all provide a one-time boost to earnings

### Boosting income through misleading classifications

- Shifting normal expenses below the line:
  - Watch for companies that constantly record "Restructuring charges"
  - Watch for companies that shift losses to discontinued operations
- Shifting non operating and nonrecurring income above the line:
  - Watch for companies that include investment income as revenue
  - Be suspicious of inflated operating income related to subsidiaries: the consolidation rule states that the company will reports 100% of subsidiary above the line, and only subtract minority interests way below the line (especially if the company owns 50-60% of the subsidiary)
- Using discretion regarding balance sheet classification to boost operating income:
  - A company could choose to consolidate earnings of a subsidiary in the case of positive earnings, BUT choose to report it with the equity method in case of losses
  - Ex: Enron boosted operating earnings by shifting losses on joint ventures to the balance sheet
