# Hyperbolic Discounting

Neuroscience has shown that the human brain processes value over different time periods inconsistently. We are short-term demanding and long-term inattentive. Our brain is hardwired for immediate rewards. Since we began investing, we have been searching for a magic formula for instant wealth. It is human nature to seek instant gratification, and the market is dominated by individuals who simply do not want to wait for much larger rewards several years down the line. As a result, many investors end up engaging in "hyperbolic discounting", heavily discounting the distant but large cash flows of high-quality businesses by applying high equity risk premiums, and they end up with much lower estimates of intrinsic business value that would have been the case otherwise. Consequently, even though those businesses might be fairly valued in the short term, then end up becoming grossly undervalued on a long-term basis. Professor Sanjay Bakshi illustrated this anomaly in his seminal October 2013 white paper on how quality businesses frequently end up getting mispriced by the market. Any stock that has compounded  at 15% to 20% for decades was, by definition, undervalued by the market for long periods of time.
