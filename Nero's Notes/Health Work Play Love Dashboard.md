# Health Work Play Love Dashboard

**Health:** I go to the gym three days a week and since I started paying attention to my diet, I have lost 10 kg and my chronic back pain is gone.  I am in a way better shape than I was one year ago. 

Gauge: Three quarter full.

**Play:** The activities I enjoy for the sake of them are reading and walking in the nature (alone or with my family), which I do a lot! I love to learn how the world works, and I aspire to be a lifelong learner... 

Gauge: Almost full

**Love:** Here I focus on my wife and my son. 

The two first years with my son were tough. As an introverted I need a lot of calm to reload my batteries and this is not what I can decently ask from a newborn/toddler.
But now our relationship is a thousand times better! I guess I needed time to adapt but I am happy that I am finally getting along with my son.

Regarding my wife, we used to have a lot of shared activities and hobbies (sport being the main one), and parenthood has changed that a lot. We need to take more time for ourselves, and sometimes emphasize more that we are not only parents, but also a couple.

Gauge: 2/3 full, I need to take more time with my wife.

**Work:** 

I am a software developer in a financial company. The salary is good (not a Hooli one, but still very comfortable) and my working schedule provides a good work/life balance (I can be at home at 4:30 pm). But I despise the values and the purpose of my firm, which at the end is just robbing the money of the final investors. The thought of expanding work for a meaningless or even harmful outcome is really doesn't fill me with joy...
I also realized that I enjoy less and less being managed (i have to admit that it depends a lot on the manager, the last one being a control-freak). Maybe I don't like to work to realize the dreams of my boss anymore (or any boss', for that matter)...

On the side I really like to take care of my own investments (i consider my second "job" to be a business owner). I take a lot of time to understand how a given business works and why it is successful (or not), and it has helped me a lot in my investments. At some point I even thought about creating a fund or similar structure, but the idea is still new and needs to be matured.
I expect that within five or six years I will be able to live from my investments, so the question becomes what to do until then.

The options are:
1. Bite the bullet, stay at my work for five years and then retire to focus on my investments.
2. Switch job, with the risk of a lower salary (and thus of a delayed early retirement) and no guarantee that I will enjoy my new job (and my work/life balance will surely worsen).
3. This is where i hope this book comes onto the stage. I don't think this is a gravity problem (and if it is, it is time-limited), so it could be great if i manage to "design" a solution to bypass it...

Gauge: 1/4 full, I clearly need to do something about this.
