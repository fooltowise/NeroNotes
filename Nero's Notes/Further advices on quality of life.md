1. Make health a top priority. Without health you cannot do anything well/correctly.
2. Recognize the power of compounding in ALL aspects of life. Fill your 24 hour period with habits which lead to compounding (and therefore crowd out ALL bad habits). We all likely have blind spots, so elicit help to identify them. Do not tolerate bad habits and/or bad behavior. This is key - zero tolerance. That's not to be equated with failures and mistakes - we learn from them, but understand which failures/mistakes should never be tolerated again. Habits are powerful - develop/manage them (start small if needed when developing good ones).
3. Embrace the concept of minimizing opportunity cost for all life choices, and practice this - develop this muscle. Which means learn how to say "No". Time is the most important resource, manage it wisely.
