# Peace is in staying the course

> "Tranquility can't be grasped except by those who have reached an unwavering and firm power of judgment - the rest constantly fall and rise in their decisions, wavering in a state of alternately rejecting and accepting things. What is the cause of this back and forth? It's because nothing is clear and they rely on the most uncertain guide - common opinion." Seneca, _Moral Letters_

_Euthymia_ is the greek word used by Seneca to describe "believing in yourself and trusting that you are on the right path, and not being in doubt by following the myriad footpaths of those wandering in every direction".

We can only reach _euthymia_ if we have clarity of vision. It means that we must feel that we are going generally in the right direction and that we don't need to compare ourselves constantly with other people.

Tranquility and peace are found in identifying _our_ path and sticking to it.
