# Diversification vs Destination Analysis

There is a second lesson embedded in the contrast between MDC and Bank X, and that is the popular wisdom that diversification lowers risk. This maxim, as homely as apple pie, is fraught with danger. Its ascendancy into the unchallengeable heights of received wisdom come from the vivid image of seeing one's nest egg disappear because of one mistake.

What is not recorded is the cost of the suboptimal outcomes that result from over-diversification which range from lack of investment work, high fees and, **most dangerous of all, complacency which allows one to ignore the only real, long term risk, which is the risk of mis-analyzing a company's destination.**

Take for example the salami slicing of loans that are embedded in securitization trusts. Diversification used in this way tries to turn ignorance into an asset. There is something of the zeigeist in this behavior: companies routinely subcontract parts of their operation in the name of efficiency, in effect salami slicing their operations into narrow functions.

This looks efficient, at least as captured by the profit and loss statements in the early years, but few firms ask: what is lost in this process? Sometimes what is lost is control of subcontracted operations such as Mattel's Chinese sourced toys, or the BBC's documentary of the Queen. But mostly it is a lack of trust in the institution by the customer and, unfortunately, this sentiment is often reciprocated. If you know a mortgage sold to you by a commissioned pimply youth now resides in one of many hedge fund's balance sheets you will feel differently about it than if your branch manager, who has known your Dad for fifty years, still has it on his books. And the pimply youth feels differently if all he has to do is sell your mortgage.

Depersonalisation inevitably leads to customer disloyalty and commoditisation, and that is not good for long term profitability, regardless of what the profits account reads today.
