# How airlines generate revenue

Thanks to decades of data gathering, airlines have a very precise idea of when customers tend to use a given air route or not.

The goal of the airline is to extract the most revenue possible given a certain demand.

If demand is too low, the airline will drop its prices, hoping to convince travelers to flight at a reduced price. There is nothing worse for an airline than an empty seat. An empty seat does not provide any revenue, therefore a small revenue is better than no revenue at all.

On the other hand if demand is high, the goal is to rise the price of the tickets as much as possible without starting to have too many empty seats.

Over the years, this yield management has been delegated to computerized algorithms. Thanks to decades of data, the algorithm knows exactly at which price to set a ticket, because over time trial and error has proved that a given price has worked in a given condition in the past.

Airlines manage both supply and demand:
- They have a rough idea of the times of year when some given routes are going to be especially in demand, thereby re-routing their lines to offer bigger capacity
- But for a finer grained picture, they rely on their yield management algorithms to regulate demand and extract as much revenue as possible from customers.
