- We are born under circumstances that would be favorable if we did not abandon them. It was Nature's intention that there should be no need of great equipment for a good life: every individual can make himself happy. External goods are of trivial importance and without much influence in either direction: prosperity does not elevate the sage and adversity does not depress him. **For he has always made the effort to rely as much as possible on himself and to derive all delight from himself.**
- The body's needs are few: it wants to be free from cold, to banish hunger and thirst with nourishment. If we long for anything more we are exerting ourselves to serve our vices, not our needs.
- No man is despised by another unless he is first despised by himself
- We are naturally disposed to admire more than anything else the man who shows fortitude in adversity.
