# Natural Selection, Ergodicity and Fractalization

[[Evolution - Natural Selection and Extinction| Natural selection]] is usually a scary process, threatening our livelihoods. However, it is possible to make it work for us rather than against us. In this chapter, I will show you how to harness the power of natural selection.

### Multiscale natural selection

In nature, those who are fit will thrive, and the unfit perish. Natural selection is a cruel yet essential phenomenon. Without it, we humans would perhaps not exist, nor civilization as we know it.

Natural selection also takes place in business. The best companies expand, open new stores, and launch new products. The worst ones fall into bankruptcy.

The same phenomenon applies to the components of companies: employees. The best ones climb in rank. The worst ones get fired.

An organization that never fires a single employee becomes uncompetitive. Natural selection at the level of the industry will make the company fail. Therefore, to avoid becoming a victim of natural selection, a company must make it act on its employees, at least in a measure.

**Natural selection is inevitable for companies, but they can decided whether it acts on them or within them.**

However, firing employees is not that good either. It has heavy consequences, especially on the fired employees and his or her family. It is something that we want to avoid within reason.

**The solution is to realize that natural selection, while inevitable, can be further pushed down to lower levels.** Just like companies can protect themselves by firing their unfit employees, employees can protect themselves by firing their unfit mental patterns.

**To protect the individual, natural selection must be free to act within the individual. There, it can select the beliefs and habits of his or hers that are fit (i.e, beneficial) and terminate those that are unfit (i.e, hinder his or her performance).**

### Fractalization
I call the process described above fractalization. The name comes from the realization that natural selection act across levels with a fractal-like pattern. Just as it acts within a market by selecting companies, it acts within companies selecting employees, within individuals selecting beliefs, and within beliefs selecting fragments.

I mean it in the broadest sense possible. For example, species are made of individuals, and individuals of muscle fibers. By exercising, and thus breaking one's muscle fibers, one gets stronger and reduces his chances (and that of his population) of becoming the victim of natural selection. Similarly, markets are made of businesses, businesses of employees, and employees of beliefs and habits.

Each level can protect itself from natural selection by becoming stronger. That requires letting natural selection working within itself. **Natural selection is inevitable, but we can avoid it at any given level by pushing it towards a lower one (in some measure)**.

You, too, can take advantage of natural selection. Remember: whenever it encounters a population, it "kills" some of its members. Therefore, you can become stronger by making yourself a population - of habits and beliefs - and getting rid of the unfit ones. Even though your ego wants to save them.

If you want to survive, do not identify with your habits and beliefs but with their container. This way, you will let natural selection remove the habits and beliefs that are holding you down. You will get stronger, thus less likely to become the victim of natural selection yourself.

An additional point, from Nassim Taleb:

> As I have shown in Antifragile, the fragility of the components is required to ensure the solidity of the system. If humans were immortals, they would go extinct from an accident or a gradual buildup of misfitness. But shorter shelf life for humans allows genetic changes to accompany the variability in the environment.
