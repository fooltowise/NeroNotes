### Clearly, the first place to start is on the short report. What were your original views when you read the report?

Analyst 1: I would say, I definitely did not anticipate that the stock would fall anywhere near 30% or 40%. I thought that there were some things in that that were a bit sensational and they discredited it a little bit. For example, the things about the customers with the cash and the agents, was ridiculous. But there were some technical things that I wasn’t too sure about, that I didn’t think I could, necessarily, answer. I certainly didn’t want to dismiss it and, actually, I had a joint call with a company and another analyst, shortly after, to go through some of the technical points. We’ve since talked to other people, as well, so we can go through some of the things that we found. I’m sure all of us have found similar things.

### Do you want to start on those technical points?

Analyst 1: We’d known that you could access it through a VPN, virtual private network, and that they couldn’t necessarily see where the originating IP address was from. Some of the points in there, where it talked about being able to access it from different roundabout countries, was something that we had to explore more with them.

I think one of the other big points that came out of it was that their relationship with the regulators is not so adversarial. It’s not as if they raise a flag and, oh my god, the regulator is going to come and shut you down. From everything that I’ve read and learned, David Rebuck, from the New Jersey regulators – one of the most respected regulators in the world – they’ve already opined on this stuff about gray markets and it’s not going to affect your ability to get a New Jersey license. I think all the top 20 casino suppliers, in New Jersey, use aggregators, so that was another thing that was a big deal in the report. It’s not such a big deal on our due diligence.

In a nutshell, those are some of the points. They work very closely with their regulators; they are talking to them all the time and they know them very well. It took them two years to get that New Jersey license, so there are no surprises from New Jersey.

The other thing that I heard was that New Jersey gets these kind of complaints all the time and they understand that there are ulterior motives as to why people do this. It’s a tough business; people are trying to get edges over everyone else. There are companies that maintain their New Jersey license that have more gray market exposure, or tougher backgrounds, than EVO – DraftKings, Bet365 – so I don’t think that’s an issue with them.

The technical stuff about the blocking was interesting because the company use the analogy that they are like a bouncer at a bar. When you first come in, they check you, but once you’re inside, you’re not checked. They said they could trace everything that these guys did to put this report together and they went over some pretty extreme hurdles to get through EVO’s defenses. They used a certain cover and, once they were inside, they dropped it. It would be like you got into a bar with an illegal license and then when you were inside, you switched and used your regular one, which nobody would do.

I’ve also learned that, even if you get in on a VPN, your experience inside sucks. You can’t really move well between games and there is continuous geo-blocking that goes on when you are in the lobby and you move from game to game; it’s a very unstable connection. Could it happen that somebody from Iran gets in through all kinds of technical manipulation? It’s possible, but it’s not very likely and they wouldn’t have a very good experience. It might be that you would be able to get in once and that’s it.

### There seems to be two different things here, from the report. One argument was that there are players from sanctioned or black listed countries using it. The other argument is that they are selling – or effectively reselling – content to illegal markets, which seems to be two different things. Obviously, one of you is in Singapore and closer to the action, than us, in terms of the APAC market. What are your views on those two questions?

Analyst 2: On the sanction market part, I thought that was a part of the report that was a bit ludicrous. Why would EVO risk the US, which is this huge pot of gold? I wrote about it in my blog. It would be kind of like running through traffic to pick up a penny, and there’s a pot of gold sitting on the sidewalk. It doesn’t make any sense and I think they’ve clarified, pretty strongly, that they do block anything from a sanctioned country.

I think the part that surprised me, as was just mentioned, is that I thought VPN was the way that everybody accessed everything in Asia. If you look at the amount of money that comes into Asia and you look at the largest countries in Asia – Indonesia, China, Philippines – it’s all illegal; you are not meant to gamble online there. A lot of India is turning black. There are a number of states that are now outright banning it. I always thought it had to be through a VPN and that EVO had that plausible deniability. But that report did show that it was, actually, quite easy to access EVO games without a VPN. Even sitting in Singapore, you can access EVO games, without needing a VPN; you just don’t say you’re from Singapore.

That was a little bit surprising to me and that’s where it caused me concern. At least for me, they no longer have that plausible deniability.

### The customers are playing via these operators with licenses in Malta or PAGCOR. EVO is selling them the content and saying, I’ve done my bouncer job. That then gets resold.

Analyst 1: We should say, this is an industry problem; it is not just an EVO thing.

Analyst 2: Absolutely. Maybe I am getting too far ahead, but how do they report those numbers of the revenues coming from different regions? They know where the IP addresses are coming from; that’s how they track it. They know where the money is coming from and there is very little to be hiding behind there.

The reality becomes, how much can they control it? The key point, that gave me a lot of comfort, is that there is only so much they, as a supplier, can tell their regulated clients what to do. I am regulated, in Singapore, as somebody who manages money for people. My suppliers don’t really tell me what to do; it would be weird. Why are you telling me what to do? I will talk to my regulators. For EVO, it is a very plausible defense to say, look, I can only tell my clients so much. In the end, they have a relationship with the regulator; the regulator knows what’s going on. Who I am to go and sit in my clients’ offices and police them?

### Do you think they know the IPs?

Analyst 3: Yes.

### Have they then not got a duty to block them, if they know they are from illegal countries?

Analyst 1: They say they do but if you are using a VPN, that’s the point; they can’t see it. That is why it is an industry problem. Some of it is not necessarily in the Far East. They use the example where you could be a Swede, and you could go to Spain and, technically, play the game in Spain, using your Swedish license. That’s illegal, but the perception is that that part is very small.

Someone just talked about disclosing. When we were on the call, one of the things that we suggested to them is breaking it out. They just report it as Asia, right now, and it lets investors’ imaginations run wild. Everyone thinks it’s China. They thought they might better their disclosures there and put the top three countries or something like that, which would probably be helpful.

Analyst 3: They currently can track; they can tell the IP address. In fact, they report that both to the regulators and to their accountant. If they chose to, they can definitely disclose it by country but that’s not what they want to do. They are probably going to improve their disclosure, but by region and not by country.

### How do they disclose that? If they have a customer, a B2B aggregator, in Malta, who then resells it in, potentially, an illegal country, how does EVO report that?

Analyst 3: I think it is still by the actual end country but we are not going to be able to see that, as investors from the outside. I think we will just see Asia as the end user, even though the aggregator is European.

Analyst 1: Can I just ensure that we are all at the same point on this. They were pretty blunt with us when they said that when somebody uses a VPN, they cannot see the IP address behind the VPN. Does everybody agree with that?

Analyst 3: Yes. My wife works as a network architect for Oracle; I verified that with her.

### When I was doing the work on EVO, the big question I had was, it is clear that a lot of the business goes through these B2B aggregators, especially in APAC, selling to operators or people with licenses in Malta or PAGCOR. These aggregators then resell the content but you don’t know where or to who. Legally, EVO can claim that they have done their job; I’m the supplier and they are licensed. But to me, it does seem as if they are somewhat closing their eyes and saying, get on with it and resell it. If most of it is behind VPNs, I understand that it’s almost impossible and it’s an industry wide problem that you cannot solve. But my question is, if they dive into this and realize that a lot of the Asian revenue is untraceable or, potentially, in illegal markets, what would the US regulator think of that? Would they even care, at this point?

Analyst 3: One of the other points that we heard from the IR guy was that they actually do not have a direct client operator in Asia. 100% of what they are getting from Asia is all through these aggregators. That is not a fact that was hidden from New Jersey.

Analyst 1: They know; it’s no surprise to New Jersey.

Analyst 3: Everybody knows.

Analyst 1: They said that they do due diligence one step down. They use an aggregator and if that aggregator uses another aggregator, they’ll do due diligence at that level. Again, they won’t go that far.

Analyst 3: I always thought, after the first, second, third read of the same report, this felt like punishing Budweiser for a local alcohol distributor having sold to a minor, with an invalid license or ID. It’s not 100% comparable, but that’s what it felt like to me. I still feel that way.

Analyst 4: It is important to know that after the Evolution management calls that the entity then knows what Evolution is doing; not the public markets, but the regulators. The regulators know Evolution very well. They have done their job and if you took them to industry experts and people within the industry, the report didn’t come as a surprise. As you said, it’s an industry problem or an industry way of operating. That gave us a bit of comfort, in the sense that Evolution was not aggressive, compared to its peers.

The other point is that after all this turmoil, Evolution’s risk on that end is going to lower because they are going to implement more policies to solve this or to be more transparent. The Evolution casino that has the license in New Jersey has also recently received the license for the UK. That is very good news because they are not just leaving things on hold. That is incrementally positive news.

Analyst 3: The other thing, when we talked to Carl, he said that one of the things they may do, going forward, going back to that comment about somebody entering the bar, after showing the ID, dropping that legal ID and picking up that illegal ID, they may be able to come up with a mechanism where they constantly test – even after entering the bar – whether you are still using the legal or illegal ID. That sort of a test can be made. They’re not promising, but I’ve heard from others that that is an easy fix they can make.

Analyst 1: The other thing that I’d be curious to know what you all think about is regulated versus unregulated. When I talk to certain other investors, sometimes they want to discount the unregulated revenue, as if it’s somehow lower quality. I don’t know how to think about that. In some ways, a regulated market isn’t necessarily 100% beneficial. Look at happened with the UK and Germany.

Analyst 4: We had that evaluation discussion, internally. It was, basically, supporting what you said. In the UK, we’ve seen the regulated markets lower the maximum bet and, for sure, that is going to punish the revenues. You can argue that it expands the mode of the business because now, operating Blackjack, for instance, is very costly, so you need to be more efficient. Maybe the fact that you lowered the bets in the UK, it may be punishing the revenues but the multiple of the business is going up. I think it is an open discussion.

The problem is that, in the mind of the investors, regulated versus unregulated is something that you don’t want to hear from a company within your portfolio. You don’t want to wake up one morning and have accusations of your business operating in illegal countries. Even though the real effect on the business itself and the cashflows and risks are not particularly different between regulated and unregulated, what we are doing internally, is penalizing unregulated revenues and, of course, attaching a lower multiple to the business; it’s less certain and there is this problem with potentially illegal markets getting shut down.

Evolution is a global company and there is a lot of comfort in the fact that they are very spread out across geographies. What we’ve heard is that no country is more than 10% of revenues, which is pretty good.

### Are you talking about the users in the end countries, from their calculations? The point doesn’t really mean anything; I don’t know how they are disclosing the revenue.

Analyst 4: You know, for sure, what’s coming from North America.

### From regulated markets?

Analyst 4: Yes. You also know what’s coming from Europe and you then have the rest of the world. Most of the countries regulated or trying to get regulated are in Africa and Latin America. It’s not shrinking; it’s opening up to the world. That trend bodes well for Evolution.

### How much do you think is coming from Chinese gamblers or consumers?

Analyst 4: I don’t know. That’s one of the big questions. The reference I got is that it’s not more than 10%.

Analyst 2: I think you have to differentiate what you mean by Chinese numbers. Do you mean the Chinese mainland or the Chinese diaspora? If you’re getting it from the Chinese diaspora, it could be very large. There are plenty of Chinese people who live in countries that are regulated, that love to gamble and play the games that they have. From mainland China, I think a lot of us here have seen the data and it’s probably very small.

### Do you think there is any potential political or regulatory risk from the Chinese government putting harsher orders on online gambling?

Analyst 2: It’s been harsh for a long time. They’ve said that gambling is absolutely illegal. You are not allowed to do it and if we find you doing it, we will take very strong action. The Chinese government has made no qualms about this.

Analyst 3: If you just look at Asia, what is the biggest country, in terms of online gambling?

Analyst 2: It’s a good question. I don’t know if I have that data. Obviously, a lot of things happen from the Philippines. It’s funny, because Filipinos aren’t actually allowed to gamble on those sites; it’s really just for foreigners. I would guess that it would probably be the Philippines or somewhere like that because they have the population size.

I just want to come back to a point that was touched on earlier. There was surprise that the stock fell 40% and it was also mentioned that the insiders weren’t at all surprised by this report. A lot of investors got into the stock because it has this great growth, great margins; it looks cool and it’s expanding in the US. People didn’t really know what they owned. They don’t make a secret of it. There’s a big number that says, regulated percentages of revenue is less than 40%; they don’t lie about it. It was funny to see people just panic, wholesale.

To that earlier point, at some time, you want to explain to your boss or your investors why you hold this stock. A lot of those people have been shaken out and I think you, hopefully, have a much stronger investor base – because I’m sure another one of these reports will come out eventually – who are much more eyes wide open and know what they have got themselves into.

Analyst 4: We also have to remember that the first panic in Evolution’s stock was when there was the report against DraftKings and SBTech. We looked at the potential risk, before that report came out but after it had come out, we were very consciously looking at the risk and talking to experts, to try to ensure we were not making a mistake. After that report, we became comfortable with the investment but then there was a rumor that a short report was coming in the US. I don’t know if you guys remember, but before it became available to the public, the stock fell 7%.

I remember saying to my partners, this is well-known in the market; it’s going to recover in two days. Actually, that was what happened; it fully recovered in two days. When there is something available to the market, maybe someone got spooked. It was information that was available; we all did our research when the SBTech report came out. But then, suddenly, panic followed panic and it went all the way down. It was painful but it was always easier to do your job if you had heard about the SBTech report.

### What did you think of management’s response?

Analyst 1: I didn’t think it was very good. I think they then compounded their mistake with that call. If you were guilty, that’s what you would do; you would hold an eight minute call, not let anybody talk. The market reacted to that too. When they announced they were going to have a call, it started creeping up and then, right after the call was over, started going right back down.

We brought that up in our call; that was one of the first things we talked about. They just completely said, yes, we made a mistake; we would never do that again. I think this management team is very inexperienced, when it comes to dealing with capital markets. They really just entirely underestimated it.

Analyst 3: Just today, Martin Carlesund was interviewed in Sweden and he is actually pretty happy about he handled it. Really?

Analyst 2: I don’t know if you guys have an opinion on this but it always appears to me that he kind of hates the IR part of this. He is just an operator.

Analyst 1: I’ve talked about this with others; he’s terrible on earnings calls. He’s terse; he’s almost insulting.

Analyst 3: If you listen to the Q3 call, or read the transcript, even in the transcript, you can see the tension. Some guy is asking about growth and Martin gives a one-word answer and there is a very pregnant silence. It’s not the first time; it’s happened in the past, but this one was very tangible.

### Just in terms of the CEO’s background, he didn’t work in gaming prior to coming to EVO. He came to EVO fresh and then ran the European operations and became CEO a couple of years later.

Analyst 3: He was COO or president, and then made the CEO soon after. He didn’t have a gaming background.

### How much stock does he own, at the moment? I saw he bought a chunk a few weeks ago.

Analyst 3: The most recent purchase is SEK25 million.

Analyst 1: I give him credit as an operator because the amount of tables they’ve opened and people they’ve hired as gone on without a hitch. He must be doing something right on that end, but he has issues as a public-facing guy.

Analyst 4: You can see that the capital allocation decisions that Evolution has made over the past year have been amazing. They were very fast at opening the US; it was a brilliant move. They paid nearly $20 million for Ezugi; how much is that making right now? It could be a $10 billion business and they paid $18 million. You can also see that with NetEnt and BTG that they have acquired.

### Just on that point, I don’t know how they purchased Ezugi so cheap. What was the story there?

Analyst 4: I don’t have a specific answer to why the guys at Ezugi didn’t see what was going to happen in the US the following summer. They opened up in May 2019, so it was pretty obvious, looking back. I guess they were very fast, because if they were a bit later, maybe there could be competition for the offer and it could be bid up. But they didn’t do that and were very sleepy where Evolution was concerned.

### Going back to the CEO, he purchased SEK25 million worth recently. How much does he own now, in total?

Analyst 4: He owns about $20 million.

Analyst 2: It says 441,000 on the website. You can go into the management page and it shows all the shareholdings.

### Is it up to date?

Analyst 2: Yes, I think it should be.

Analyst 3: Yes, 460,000 but, on top of that, they have what they call warrants. They act more like stock options, to me. Just for those warrants, almost all of them are still in the money. He’s got 458,923 shares.

Analyst 2: And then 1.65 million in warrants.

Analyst 4: Overall, the management team have close to $100 million in stock.

Analyst 1: From a risk standpoint, I think Todd Haushalter is the key man. If he were to leave or something happened there, that would be an issue.

Analyst 2: That’s an interesting point. After we’d got done with all the questions about the report, I asked Carl about the business and asked what would happen if Todd leaves. He said, we give Todd an unlimited budget. We tell him he can work on whatever he wants. There are no deadlines; you can just go crazy. He’s not going to get better than that anywhere else. We know we have that faith in him and nobody is going to give him this elsewhere. For him, it becomes about creating the best games possible and we are pretty confident we give him the best platform for doing that.

Obviously, everybody has a price. If you offer him an ungodly amount of money, who knows. But barring anything like that, it seems that they are pretty confident that they give him the best opportunity to create the best games.

Analyst 1: I heard the same thing. He can pretty much do whatever he wants and he’s got the dream job.

### I just want to go back to the short report, just so we’re all clear. How do you think management is going to go from here, in terms of disclosures, explanations or reports? What would you like to see from them, exactly?

Analyst 3: I was under the impression that they would be clarifying with another release before the end of the year, 2021. Obviously, that didn’t happen and tomorrow, 14th January, the window closes before their earnings release. At this point, I don’t expect any new release or updates from them. They will, more likely, include it as part of their earnings release and clarify it on the call. But I believe other people had a slightly different understanding?

Analyst 1: Yes. We criticized their initial response and we told them to do something better. I thought they had said they were going to make another response and I heard, before their next earnings report; this is where we differ. In my notes, I had before the next earnings report, which would have to be today or tomorrow. When we asked them, their responses were, firstly, the buyback, which came out shortly after our call. Secondly, they said they would do something else before their earnings and then the earnings itself would be a response.

Analyst 3: Unless they consider the fireside chat with Morgan Stanley as a release.

Analyst 1: That’s the only thing I can think of; they did have that fireside chat with Morgan Stanley and, perhaps, they are considering that to be their response. But the disclosure question is interesting too; what additional disclosures might we like to see? I think, breaking up Asia somehow and giving people more granularity there would be good.

### What could they do there?

Analyst 1: Even if they just mentioned top three countries.

Analyst 4: Maybe just a statement saying, look, in Asia, there is no country representing more than 10% of all revenues. Maybe that would be enough. You don’t have to break everything down.

Analyst 2: My expectations are low that they are going to do a lot more here. If the regulators aren’t going to force them to do anything they won’t. There’s a competitive element; there’s not too much they want to say because the competitors can lean in on that. I think they feel as if they have done enough with the stock buyback program; the stock has come back up 40% from its low. Hopefully, the earnings should be super strong and speak for itself, considering some of the data that I’m sure we’ve all seen. I’m keeping my expectations low that they are actually going to disclose very much more.

### On the back of this, what is the biggest risk?

Analyst 2: There’s always risk. I think people forget that gambling, not very long ago, was a very dirty industry. It wasn’t that long ago that casinos, in Vegas, were run by the Mob. To think that everything is so clean now, in the online world, is just ludicrous. You’re going to have to deal with swathes of gray areas, here. A lot of what we talked about is that we just have to deal with the concerns; there will always be another report or another shoe to drop.

For me, I think the risk is actually not related to this. I just sometimes worry that the US is going to go a lot slower than expected and that it takes longer. If states don’t legalize the online gaming part of it, as quickly as possible, growth slows in Europe and Asia, for whatever reason, doesn’t grow, I think that is more of a risk for me than anything that has come out of these reports now.

As I said, I think the investor base will now handle any more shocks better, because the more these reports come out, the more it becomes old news and the more you have investor bases that are used to it.

### Is there a risk that the APAC growth, GGR growth, could actually be slow on the back of this, in terms of more double checking or whatever it may be? Or is this just a booming industry and it’s going to grow regardless?

Analyst 3: Your question seems to assume some kind of a check has not been happening.

### I mean, just more checks. My point is, let’s say the US regulator is now even more aware, or more conscious, could there be a scenario where EVO or suppliers have to put more checks in place, or show more data, show the IP addresses, whatever it may be? Management might even say, is it even worth me doing this, in this market?

Analyst 2: If they were to do that, it would affect the whole industry. EVO has the best margins in the industry, so they would be able to handle that a lot better than anybody else. I find it hard for the regulator to, all of a sudden, appear to never have known this was happening and have to crank it up.

Analyst 3: I absolutely agree with you. As an aside, I used to work for a bank in San Francisco and we had a regulator in the bank, in our building, with an office, where we would go to him for any and all updates, acquisitions, operational issues. What Carl was telling us was very similar to what I’ve experienced as a bank employee; constant updates and keep the surprises as minimal as possible, if not completely zero.

### In your eyes, it’s a risk of APAC growth slowing for any reason on the back of this and actually, this is just a function of the industry structure than investors have to get comfortable with?

Analyst 1: When I think about the risks of EVO, firstly, there is execution stuff because, again, they are hiring so many people, opening so many tables, different languages. What they are doing is amazingly technical and they are making it all seamless. So far, they’ve done it without a hitch. Secondly, there is regulatory stuff; you always have the possibility of there being another Germany or negative UK outcome. That’s always something you’ve got to live with. The counter to that is that they’re very well diversified.

Thirdly, I always think about competition. They are so far ahead of everybody at the moment, but that’s not to say that will always be the case. They are currently certainly in the best position and if there is some small company that comes up with a great game, they have the ability to buy it; they have a variety of ways to respond. The fourth thing I always think about is Todd. We talked about him pretty much having the keys to the kingdom, but you could have some key man risk, I think. If I had to frame four big picture risks, those are the things I would think of.

Analyst 2: Say you play that out and the New Jersey regulator sees all this and gets freaked out and, worst case scenario, closes EVO’s license. The reality is, what do you think the regulator cares more about, the fact that they might be dealing in Singapore or China, or the fact that they are bringing close to 1,000 jobs into New Jersey, plus all the revenues?

### I think there is no doubt that EVO is going to be in the US, in the states that open, and they have the leading product. My point is, does there come a time where the US would say, you can have the license, but we’re not too comfortable or happy with X, Y, Z? Is there a situation where the US is the pot of gold and they can go after that but, actually, you might lose some of this unregulated, unknown GGR, to get that pot of gold? That’s the kind of transition that I am thinking about in the stock and revenue. If the US is a slower burn, which could be likely and states open more slowly, if to get that slower burn, it requires you to lose some of the unregulated business, that may bring the revenue growth for EVO?

Analyst 1: My opinion is that that would be very unlikely. It would be very unlikely for a regulator, in the US, to try to enforce the regulations in other countries. That is what you are kind of implying. If EVO is complying with everything in New Jersey, why do the New Jersey regulators care? If stuff is going on in Hong Kong or China, they don’t care. That is my understanding, so far.

### Not enforcing the regulations in other countries, just requiring more information about their operations than they might already have?

Analyst 1: In some ways, that raises the barrier to entry for everybody. It is already pretty tough. It has taken Evolution two years to get their license.

### The long-term value of EVO of that business is still very high, it is just that getting there could require, potentially, losing part of that. Ideally, it wouldn’t, but that is where I see a potential risk.

Analyst 4: It could definitely put pressure on revenue growth from certain countries, as you pointed out. But I think what makes me comfortable with the revenue growth is that the numbers that we’ve seen or heard in the industry are massive. It is 10 or 20 times Europe. Even if you ban some countries in APAC, I think the revenue growth will be strong. The fact that Evolution, for the first year, is specifically issuing or releasing games to this specific region, seems to suggest that we have not seen the potential of Evolution in this side of the market. But yes, it could put pressure on margins and on revenues, as well.

### Any other comments on that?

Analyst 2: I think the point is, as was just said, the US is supposed to be 10 times bigger than Europe. Also, the company is very excited about Latin America. I think there are a lot of things opening up there; it’s quite legal. I think there were some announcements recently and, actually, I asked Carl what he was most excited about and he said it was Latin America. Obviously, the US was an obvious answer but he said he didn’t think people were paying enough attention to what was happening in Latin America and how much opportunity there was there. I think a lot of that will be regulated. It will be interesting to see how that plays out. But, as was noted earlier, it’s a global company; they have a lot of levers.

### This is also one of the big bull cases raised. They are probably so diversified, in terms of having to go through all these regulatory legislations.

Analyst 1: In the US, we talk about it as if it is one market but there are 50 different regulators. I know they follow each other; it would be weird to have New Jersey say it’s okay and then have somebody else say no. It could happen; it is 50 different markets.

### Looking more fundamentally at the business, one of the things that we could be worried about was the fact that they could, potentially, lose their edge. Obviously, they are currently the leader by far, it seems. Everyone you speak to says they are the best product, the best games. What could be a reason they may lose their edge to competitors? How would you compete with this business?

Analyst 1: We’ve heard about a lot of different competitors; small companies trying different things. I don’t think you could match the overall package, but you could come up with a hit game of some kind.

Analyst 2: They need to work hard in slots. I think NetEnt will only grow if they develop in slots and that could be somewhere where a competitor could, conceivably, do better than them. Whilst they may have live gaming wrapped up, in my opinion, slots are still a pretty open market.

### Is that important for live? Do they get sold at the same time and the same buyer?

Analyst 2: If they don’t start growing revenues for NetEnt, a lot of us will be saying, why did you buy it in the first place? That was thing with the all stock deal, which I don’t love, because I think that was done at 500SEK per share, at that time.

### This is one of the questions I have. I don’t know why they keep using their shares so much to acquire these businesses? I think each deal has been part-equity?

Analyst 1: Their response is that they have to, because the sellers know EVO is a great company and they don’t want to just take cash.

Analyst 3: Whilst I agree that the capital management has been focused on opening new games and hiring people has been perfect, on the other hand, using stock to make these acquisitions and paying that 50% of earnings as dividends, personally, I don’t necessarily like those. I think I would give them a C, if I were to rank the management team, in terms of overall package of capital management.

Analyst 4: I think the question of NetEnt was not so much about the slots themselves, but about securing the whole market in the US. If you think about how slots work versus live casino, in live casino, you need to build a physical casino within the state. That takes time and then, of course, you need a license. That is not the way it works for slots; you can start with your slot games, once you get the license. That then helps them to secure partnerships with other operators. You start from scratch, from the very beginning and you start issuing those.

On top of that, they said that they are now building these capabilities with slots combining in the same distribution package; this pipe through which they will share both RNG games and live casino games. I think their distribution network is going to work, as well. At the same time, you can provide the entire package to the operators. I was happy to see that deal coming because they tried to enter slots and they couldn’t. They also open up for other games to come online, such as the ones that mix RNG and live casino, which has not been a success but it’s a seed that you can plant.

One final comment is that one of the things that I’ve learned in this industry is that it has nothing to do with video games; video games are boom and bust. You can have three geeks in a garage or people building a new game every single year. But in the gambling sector, it’s not like that. People keep playing Blackjack and Roulette for decades. There is this very small company, called Galaxy Gaming, which provides side bets. They have the rights to side bets that you can put on Blackjack. One of the most famous is 21+3, where you can place a side bet when you are playing Blackjack. It’s a very simple side bet and they license that for every single casino and now they are licensing it for online casinos as well.

Evolution is their largest customer, in online casino. Evolution have said, let’s try to replicate that; it can’t be that hard. So they left Galaxy Gaming and they had to come back six months later, because they couldn’t do it. Once the player is used to a type of game and they trust the game, they don’t want to play anything else. They don’t want to play 21+5 or 21+2; they want to play 21+3. It’s stupid, but it’s how it works. It puts more emphasis on how huge Crazy Time has been.

Crazy Time is very important because it’s something that if it keeps going as it is right now and more and more players come to play it, it is going to become – I don’t want to say Blackjack – but it’s the game that everyone has in mind. We’ve seen that from the growth in players. If you compare that to Wonderland, which is Playtech’s copycat, it has nothing to do with Crazy Time, even though, to an outsider, it seems as if it is the same game. It is very hard to end up innovating in this industry.

### What would you estimate is the level of revenue, GGR, that comes from the non-traditional games, for EVO? I’m talking about excluding Blackjack and Roulette.

Analyst 4: Clearly, the number of players of proprietary games count, for sure, for more than 50%. You can see that in the lobby; top games by number of players are Crazy Time, Roulette and Monopoly. I think the fourth is a proprietary game from Evolution. That is also pretty important because it is something that others cannot offer. You cannot play those games in Playtech or other providers. It’s well above 50%, for sure.

### One of the other questions that I had, when looking at this space, was talking about the US and, again, the advantages of EVO being the leading supplier. How much do you think the game shows actually matter in winning those deals or becoming the lead supplier versus a competitor providing really cheap Blackjack and Roulette tables? What really matters for a casino when they’re buying these services from EVO?

Analyst 2: There are elements of the game itself; people really love Crazy Time so you need to offer it, if you are operator. But it’s also not as simple as just going with anybody with Blackjack. There is a lot of tech in there; you can’t have latency. You can’t have any issue related to money not working properly. You can’t just go with anybody. Even for the more ‘traditional’ games, you need to go with the best suppliers because it’s going to affect your customer experience and it’s on your brand, if you don’t have the best provider there.

### Let’s just walk through it. Let’s say you are a US casino in a state that has just been legalized. Suppliers, such as EVO and Playtech come in and are selling their services. What matters? They’ve got to build a new studio in the state, I assume? They’ve got to build their asset base; EVO will have to build their studio in the state. What are they competing on, exactly? Is it the game shows that the casino is attracted to?

Analyst 1: I think it’s a combination of factors. They know they have to upfront a certain amount of costs if they want a dedicated table or something like that. From what I understand, EVO is the high end but they show you the returns you will make when you play off their games. As it’s been said, it depends on certain popular games that you feel as if you have to have, so you would probably lean EVO. But there’s really not that many choices; it’s pretty much EVO and Playtech.

### If you are a big casino in the US, can you build this yourself or have a partnership with EVO and share the economics?

Analyst 3: MGM and a fe[\[PR1\]](https://inpractise.com/admin/cms/articles/new#_msocom_1) w other land-based organizations have tried it and they’ve given up because of a variety of things. It’s not just the capital but it’s the technical expertise, the variety of games, the type of games. It’s not a new issue. Yes, somebody can actually come around and fix those; maybe under Barry Diller, MGM can come at it again. So far, land-based have not been successful.

Analyst 4: I think it’s one of the key investment elements we hold. It’s very hard to explain or convince someone else but it has definitely been the rule up to now. The key question is, who owns the demand here? Is it the operator? Is it the provider? Who is really driving people to the games? Again, it comes back to the example of the side bets and when a game gets popular and people trust it, it’s very important. In the case of Evolution, we’ve seen, and we’ve heard from experts, that you can have a classic game, like Blackjack, and you can put together Blackjack from Evolution and Blackjack from Playtech and the players are going to hit Blackjack from Evolution 10 times more; the difference is massive.

### Why is that?

Analyst 4: It’s the look and feel. They trust it.

Analyst 1: I know exactly what you are saying; it’s hard to articulate it. There was a company, called Leo Las Vegas that tried to do this. They set up webcams and did the whole thing and, apparently, for people like us, it was okay. But when they actually ran it, they wound up closing it down and selling it because, for the players, there was something intangible about it; they preferred the EVO game.

Analyst 4: We’ve seen that with Kindred, which is already an operator in the US. They now have a partnership with Pragmatic. They’ve created a partnership in which they have Evolution dedicated tables, for Blackjack and Evolution/Pragmatic branded dedicated tables. They are both very similar. One of our investment hypotheses is that the industry, in the end, will match the quality of Evolution. The problem is that players keep clicking on Evolution games because of the look. I have the screenshot of all the dedicated tables from Pragmatic empty – no players at all – and all tables from Evolution are full. It’s not as if it is 30/70; it’s 1/99 on the side of Evolution, so it’s massive. It comes down to this look and feel, to the trust.

There is a company called BTG, Big Time Gaming, which was valued by Evolution at almost half a billion, and it is just like a mechanic for slots which can easily be replicated; why don’t they just do that? It is just a mathematical exercise and you put another name on it.

### This was my point around the game shows versus the core, traditional games. I don’t know how much GGR there is from each; I don’t think they disclose between Roulette, Blackjack and Crazy Time and those games. Do you have to believe that, actually, they have an edge in producing Blackjack and Roulette, in the field of mechanics and mechanisms, as well, forgetting Crazy Time? I would assume that most of the GGR comes from Blackjack and Roulette, at this point. Is there a competitive risk that Pragmatic and Playtech could just get closer to EVO, over time?

Analyst 4: They will do, for sure. We’re coming back to the same thing.

Analyst 1: It’s like people getting closer and closer to Coca-Cola, but people still by Coke.

### Pepsi have done pretty well.

Analyst 1: Maybe there will be a two-horse race here, as well. Maybe it will just come down to EVO and Playtech. It does have the nature of being duopolistic because of all the costs. Over time, this is going to start to melt. EVO is going to have this huge library of games; the amount they are going to be able to spend on games is astronomical compared to everybody else, so it’s just going to feed into it.

### What about the US side? The US is obviously a very different market from Europe, in terms of the power that the casinos have. You talked about who owns the demand. Wouldn’t the casino think they own the demand?

Analyst 4: Maybe they think that, but for sure, they do not own the demand. If you take Crazy Time out of the lobby, people are going to leave. You’ve had this huge number of streamers and, on top of that, if you think about the European market, it’s one market; you can stream from just one place, such as Georgia, for instance, or Malta. You are streaming for a whole continent.

In the US, first of all, instead of being 500 million people, it’s 10 million people, let’s say; eight million people in the case of New Jersey. Secondly, you have the benefit of first mover advantage which Evolution didn’t have in the past, because they were not the first ones providing live casino in Europe. If we were to agree that the look and feel, the trust and the fact that you’ve been able to play live casino and learn how to do that with Evolution games, it is going to be a monopoly. There is no chance that Playtech will manage to get even double digit share from the New Jersey market, for instance. We will see that in the coming years.

### How do you see this evolving? Let’s say they open and EVO moves in, what is going to be the state of play? Do you think that one casino will take EVO, they get scale, they build a studio, they start streaming, get latency? Why would anyone choose Pragmatic or Playtech, unless it’s a really cheap price?

Analyst 2: There are some elements of why Playtech might still win deals. There is an element of customization that I’ve heard that they tend to go a little further to do; more so than Evolution. Evolution is more of a package; this is what we offer and we won’t really adjust it. There is also this slight element of an operator wanting to have two suppliers, just in case one gets too ‘powerful’. I think as someone said, there will always be a place for a second and third player; there is no doubt about that. I think operators would be smart to bring on more than one supplier.

To everybody’s point, it’s hard to beat Evolution, in what they are doing right now, in live casino.

Analyst 1: The other competitive thing I’ve heard is that Playtech has a better customer relationship management platform, that is better than EVO’s. That is something else that has come up so, perhaps, that might be important?

### Is that the promotions and bonusing?

Analyst 1: Yes; and I think being able to customize it more.

Analyst 3: For the bonus part, I think you are referring to the RTP, return to the player. I think Evolution is still way ahead there.

Analyst 2: I have a quick question for the people in the US and I’m curious as to what your thoughts are. People assume that casinos, in the US, are all in the Vegas strip; it’s fun, it’s exciting and you go and play. But a lot of casinos are, actually, in these small towns or areas. For example, I did my business school degree in Chicago and, to gamble, we would go to the Horseshoe Hammond, in Indiana, which is a really sad place to go and gamble. It’s actually a terrible experience. It’s not very fun; it’s dingy. I would much rather just play online. Do you guys have a sense of what’s happening? With the increase of online gambling happening, especially on a weekday where somebody doesn’t want to travel an hour to go to the casino but can play at their home, do you think that is going to have a huge effect on these more regional casinos?

Analyst 1: I don’t know; it’s a good question.

Analyst 3: I think the local, smaller casinos do have regular, ongoing business. Indian casinos are known for being attractive to that local population. I think one of you was invested in this, years ago, in Tropicana, which was, essentially, a collection of all these small casinos. That is an ongoing thing. In fact, I’ve heard that, because of the nature of their clientele, something like slot games would be a lot more attractive for them to offer and some of the smaller players – the Aspires of the world – are catering to these Indian casinos and smaller operators across the country.

That is a positive for EVO, over time. They are not focused on just the DraftKings of the world – and FanDuel, of course, is not on the list – but they can cater to these smaller operators, offering slots to these Indian Reserves.

Analyst 1: I don’t really have a strong opinion. I don’t really know anyone who gambles, which is a bit ironic. For people who regularly go to casinos, I’d be curious as to whether it was just another thing, a different experience to play, or will they substitute and not go to the casino? There isn’t a casino really close. I guess there is one in Virginia, there’s one up near Baltimore. It will be interesting to see how that plays out.

### I’ve got a couple more questions unless anybody has something they want to raise?

Analyst 3: Somebody mentioned that the term gambling has a negative connotation. It is true, but thanks to PASPA passing and all these online sports betting companies taking a bigger role and advertising, very publicly, on TV, sports betting has a very different connotation relative to gambling. I’ve had conversations with a couple of large managers and they are fine investing in cigarette companies, in alcohol companies – they are proud of owning Diageo or Pernod Ricard – but they are absolutely not fine investing in gambling.

I’ve told them, a couple of times, it’s not gambling; it’s entertainment. In fact, in 2019, Haushalter compared competition for EVO to be Disney and Netflix, and not Playtech and Pragmatic. I think they are doing EVO a favor by being so public in advertisements, highlighting the fun part of sports betting. But it’s not a near-term positive; there are still investors held back by the term gambling. Over time, I think that’s a positive.

Analyst 2: I don’t know how it works for you guys in the US but, for example, the regulator here has actually passed some resolutions that they want us to start documenting the ESG risks to all our investing. You have to outline what the risk is, how you might mitigate it, would could happen. For a lot of fund managers, some might go ahead and do that. Some might say, forget this; I’m just not going to do investment in all these places. I don’t know how pervasive that is and I don’t know if our regulators are just more conservative in that regard, but that is always a problem.

### What do you have to do, exactly?

Analyst 2: Internally, you would have to document all the risks associated with ESG, related to this investment, and how it might be mitigated and what happens. If an investment goes bad, they can ask you where this documentation is. Obviously, you can do it and there is some onus there, but some people might just choose to avoid all that type of investment, which could happen. Again, I don’t know how pervasive this is, globally. But I’m certainly seeing it on my end.

So now, in my write ups, I have this little section about the ESG components and where I think the risks are. It’s certainly an onus thing.

Analyst 3: I’ve heard of that being an issue in Sweden and a few other European countries, but I don’t think it’s that big an issue yet, here in the US.

Analyst 1: I have not heard of that; that’s new.

Analyst 3: If you take two annual reports, one from the US and one from Europe, a good 30, 40, 50 pages of the European annual report is catered towards ESG issues. Thankfully, it’s not yet an issue here in the US.

Analyst 1: Maybe it will change.

Analyst 3: Hopefully not.

### How do you guys look at valuation, for 2025? What are you expecting revenue growth wise? The EBITDA margin is just insane for this company. I think most of that – about 80% – translates into free cash?

Analyst 3: Yes.

### What are you looking at, revenue wise, this year, where it seems to be well over a billion euros, and for the next couple of years?

Analyst 4: Basically, the way that we think about growth potential here is that, probably, North America and Asia are going to be one billion in revenue, by 2025. If you compare that to the total revenue that they are doing, just in live, in Europe right now, it is half a billion.

Why did we come to the figure of North America being double Europe? One of the interesting data points that we managed to get is the New Jersey gross gaming revenue per capita. It is also important to know that there is a nice recovery in land-based casinos and you can see, with the charts, that online gaming is creating its own demand. The demand, prior to Covid, of land-based casinos has not been punished; it’s pretty much the same. It has fully recovered, whilst online casinos have kept their own base. That is probably because most of the investors, when they look at revenues from Evolution base, they look at the TAM and they associate the TAM with online gaming, but most of it, worldwide, is land-based casinos.

I think that’s a huge mistake because you are losing one big part of the thesis which is that this is creating its own demand. They are not gambling in the same way; it’s an entertainment business, not just pure gambling.

The other thing is that we’ve heard that Asia is growing massively. In the report, Evolution is reporting that growth is at triple digits. It is not outrageous to imagine them at least reaching the level of North America. Basically, we are progressing more than 30%, compounded, for the next five years; more than €3 billion, by 2025.

Analyst 3: I have closer to €4 billion, but I won’t disagree with you.

Analyst 4: Yes, closer to €4 billion.

### Either way, it’s still looking pretty cheap. I expect them to blow their lights out this quarter, as well; not even 30 times free cash, this year.

Analyst 3: If you listen to Martin, both Q2, Q3 and all through this particular episode, the one constant that he kept repeating was the number of games that are going to come out in 2022. ICE, of course, was postponed because of Covid; hopefully they get back on track and release a number of games. There was a little bit of a slowdown in 2021 because of their internal IT issues and stuff like that. The new games, on top of what we’ve just talked about, means I would suspect there would be a big tailwind.

Analyst 2: I don’t think you have to project too far out to understand that there is something wrong. The stock has been flat for the better part of a year. If you look at the growth, even just during this year, it seems that all it needs is one really good report and you’re going to see a large upside. My numbers look similar to what these guys are talking about. But again, we’re all bulls.

### Are there many other acquisition opportunities? Do you expect them to keep using stock to go and buy BTG?

Analyst 3: I hope not.

Analyst 4: That’s one of the risks. I have studied Galaxy Gaming, the company that I mentioned earlier. I would like to see Evolution acquire this business or for it to remain alone in the market because it’s a public company. I don’t care how much they pay for Galaxy Gaming, to be honest. I just want this business to be within Evolution or to remain alone in the market; not within Playtech or someone else.

They have this huge rights and IP on side bets, which cannot be replicated, even by Evolution. Specifically, they have the top three side bets for Blackjack. As you know, Blackjack is the most important game in online gambling, not only because of the amount of players that want to play it, but because of the way it operates; it’s not scalable. I don’t want anybody else to own Galaxy Gaming and I don’t care if Evolution pays five times what it is now trading at in public markets; it’s going to be a fine acquisition.

Analyst 3: Do you mind if they issue stock?

Analyst 4: I want them to acquire this business. I don’t want to see this business in the hands of Playtech, for instance. I don’t care if they issue stock.

### That goes back to your point that, actually, the game owns the demand and you need to own that?

Analyst 4: Blackjack is pretty important to have on your side and side bets are, again, very important. Not only because it engages the player more within the game itself, but also because the return to player is way lower. Most of the money you will get on the side and not on Blackjack itself. I want Evolution to buy Galaxy Gaming and I am sure they are waiting on it and we probably see that in 2022.

### Is there anything else that anybody wants to raise?

Analyst 2: I don’t know if anybody saw those rumors that LVS was trying to buy Evolution? I don’t know if anybody caught wind of that or what that was about, because it sounds ludicrous.

Analyst 4: Nothing specific; it doesn’t make much sense.

Analyst 2: Maybe they were the ones that created the report.

Analyst 1: I guess we don’t know who wrote the report? Just rumors.

Analyst 2: At first, I thought it was Scientific Games, but then they have a partnership in land-based, so I thought it would be pretty weird. I’m still not sure.
