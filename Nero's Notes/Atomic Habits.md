### Goals vs Systems

- Goals are good for setting a direction. Systems are best for making progress.
- You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your [[System Thinking | systems]].

### Identity Based habits
- There are 3 levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change
- The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, **but on who you wish to become** 
- Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
- Becoming the best version of yourself  requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity
- The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.

1. Decide the type of person you want to be
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins

Your identity is etymologically your _repeated beingness_.

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It's one thing to say I'm the type of person who _wants_ this. It's something very different to say I'm the type of person who _is_ this.
The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If you're proud of how your hair looks, you'll develop all sorts of habits to care and maintain it. If you're proud of the size of your biceps, you'll make sure you never skip an upper-body workout. **Once your pride gets involved, you'll fight tooth and nail to maintain your habits.**

### 4 steps for building better habits

- A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic
**- The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible**
- Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response and reward
- The four laws of behavior change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) Make it obvious, (2) Make it attractive, (3) Make it easy, (4) Make it satisfying.
