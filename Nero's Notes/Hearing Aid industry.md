# Hearing Aid Industry

In the upscale hearing aid market, a field dominated by European firms - Siemens, William Demant, GN Store Nord, and Phonak - the business model is based on innovation and the [[Agency Business Model]].
The fitters of hearing aids, like dentists, aare keen to sell high-end products which earn them more money. William Demant (a portfolio holding with margins above 20% agter spending 7% of sales on R&D) that one of the defining characteristics of high-end products is that they require a customized fitting, since everyone's ocular canal is unique. Their hearing aid costs around $1'000. On top of this, the fitter charges another $2'000 for customized service. As with [[Geberit's business model]], innovation in hearing aid technology has been a boon for raising product's prices. Once again, the customer (the fitter-agent) is not price-sensitive. The producers of hearing aids and dental implants are benefitting from the fact that the market into which they sell their products is so fragmented.
