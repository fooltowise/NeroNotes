# Characteristics of effective [[Corporate Culture|Corporate Cultures]]

The cultures of the more successful organizations we've examined share all or most of a number of characteristics:
- They result from a mission, basic assumptions, values, and behaviors that are the product of leadership from the top, often beginning with a founder. They define "the way we do things around here."
- They evolve over time into serving their organizations well and are employed to recruit new members who subscribe to their precepts. 
- They both influence and reflect strategy and how it is executed, requiring alignment among culture, strategy, and execution.
- They can be shaped, at least to a point, through a process described by a "culture cycle" involving the following:
	- Identifying and communicating the mission as well as shared assumptions and values, creating the basis for expectations
	- Setting and meeting expectations among organization members
	- Thereby establishing trust, engagement, and ownership among employees
	- Enabling the policies, practices, and behaviors that characterize great places to work.
	- Fostering the learning behaviors critical to long-term organization performance
	- Producing the economic and non-economic results that confirm the rightness (or wrongness) of a culture, an associated strategy, and the way both are executed
	- Periodic reviews of the mission as well as shared assumptions, values, and accepted behaviors
- Largely through peer interest and pressure, they encourage those who join to place the organization's needs alongside (and often above) their own and encourage "nonbelievers" to leave the organization
- They foster trust, engagement, and ownership, often through extraordinary efforts to share important information about processes and outcomes and generally meet expectations.
- They do not utilize the "star system", instead emphasizing contributions to a team-based effort.
- They encourage work through teams invested with a high degree of decision-making latitude and responsibilities for managing themselves.
- They are inclusive, recognizing the advantages of diversity in innovation an other activities.
- They seek ways to create organizations that seem small even though they may be very large
- They focus on and reward results, not just effort.
- They benefit from continuity in leadership that is most often provided by promotion from within.

At the same time, to be effective over the long-term, these cultures foster change and encourage constant attention to it. They do this by doing the following:
- Building trust among organization members that encourages openness and cooperation while providing assurance that those suggesting change will not be penalized. 
- Encouraging the constant questioning of assumptions and recommendations during the process of deliberation, not afterward.
- Promoting boundary-less behaviors such as benchmarking, the sharing of ideas and resources across the organization, and internal best-practice comparisons.
- Fostering ownership among both employees and customers by soliciting ideas for new products, services, processes, and policies, as well as referrals of new employees and customers. For example, about 85% of the Mayo Clinic's patients, according to one survey, have recommended to others that they seek treatment there. On average, each has generated five new patients for the Clinic.


## Economic Outcomes: Profit and Satisfied Stakeholders

In a theoretical example based on generalized experience, I showed how an effective culture can produce distinct competitive advantage. The "Four R" model is composed of the following:
- A higher rate of employee *referrals* of new candidates and reduced recruiting costs for the organization.
- Higher employee *retention* that leads to lower costs or recruitment, selection, and training
- Higher productivity, or *returns on labor*, that produce a favorable compensation/revenue cost ratio
- Better *relationships with customers* that result in more customer loyalty and referrals of new customers.
The sum of these effects is usually a high single digit percentage point boost in margins that could spell the difference between profit and loss.

A field in the Four R framework in several offices of a global marketing services firm confirmed that in an organization in which a large proportion of employees are customer-facing, *as much as half of the difference in operating profit performance between offices can be attributed to culture.*
