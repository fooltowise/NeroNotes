## About [[Corporate Culture]]

*So it's important that senior managers focus on what they actually can control: fostering a humble culture that encourages continuous improvement, holding the line on corporate costs, driving toward manufacturing excellence, encouraging extreme customer focus, establishing a disciplined capital allocation process, moving a portfolio toward higher-return assets, all while setting the incentives needed to  keep employees focused on the task at hand. These are the factors that differentiate the winners from everyone else.*

*We spend tremendous effort looking for signs of arrogance; it's the most common attribute of failure, even rising above complacency, and those who succeed seem to find a way to encourage humility. We describe how business systems and rigorous benchmarking can keep companies grounded so they keep doing the work to sustain the business over the long run. And we focus on how companies that continuously improve their operations generate the cash flow necessary to invest even more creatively in new products and opportunistic acquisitions. And how they are then able to use continuous improvement processes to drive higher profits and cash from those incremental investments - in a very methodical, repeatable fashion.*

*Like many business books, we do fixate on culture but not in the same context as popular literature. A healthy and supportive culture is absolutely critical to any company's long-term success. But we've found it to be a by-product of actions and incentives, not a driver. Said a different way, it can't be force-fed from the top. It's not about words - it's about actions. Most companies that talk about culture don't have one, at least not a good one. Culture doesn't come from a mission statement or a CEO's web-casted lecture. Culture is encouraged from the top but is actually built from the bottom - on the factory floor or in the cubicles where the actual work gets done.*

1) The safety and well-being of employees must be its foundation. 
2) The customer centricity in the sales and marketing organization is the next building block.
3) Is the R&D organization dedicated to solving today's customer problems and the day-to-day blocking and tackling that goes along with that mission? 
4) Are employees focused, motivated, empowered, and committed to continuous improvement?
5) Do Leaders benchmark to best in class and accept the challenge if their company begins to fall behind?
6) Is being ethical a basic minimum expectation?
7) Does bad news travel faster than good, and do leaders rally to solve the problem, or do they waste energy assigning blame?

*While it's convenient to talk about culture from the corporate office vantage, it's meaningless if managers don't live it at the most junior levels and if it hasn't permeated through to the lowest rung of labor.*

*Where the top of the organization influences culture is on actions and incentives. CEOs who behave badly typically run organizations that ... behave badly. Compensate folks to do the right thing, and that good behavior will likely become the norm. Financial incentives do matter. There is no right or wrong culture, we've seen successful companies with quite different approaches that work. Ping-Pong tables and nap rooms may help set the casual tone for some organizations but could have just the opposite impact for others. What matters is whether those approaches fit the company's leadership, capabilities, and challenges.*
