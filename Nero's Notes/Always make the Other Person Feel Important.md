# Always Make The Other Person Feel Important

See also [[Give Honest and Sincere Appreciation]].

Little phrases such as:
- *I am sorry to trouble you, ...*
- *Would you be so kind as to ...*
- *Won't you please ...*
Little courtesies like these oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of everyday life  - and, incidentally, they are the hallmark of good breeding.

**Find what you can admire in your interlocutor and show that you admire it.**
