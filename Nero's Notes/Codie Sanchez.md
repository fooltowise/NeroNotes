# Codie Sanchez



- Study [[Copywriting]], learn from the greats (Sam Parr, Contrarian Thinking)
- Find your inner voice. You should make sure that you repel people that are not right for your brand, and attract people that are right for your brand

- Then focus on distribution:
	- find a few people that are your true fans and make sure that they get a lot of value from you
	- that often means a free newsletter for at least a year
	- I find similar audiences to mine and I try to serve them. Try to find someone else's audience and steal a bit of their attention. For Codie that was a group called The Hustle and Trends. Source https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=999rMfWAtzw


- Buy boring, unsexy business
