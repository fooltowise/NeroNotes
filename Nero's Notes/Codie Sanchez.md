## Study [[Copywriting]]

Learn from the greats ([[Sam Parr]] (see [[Write like the Hustle]]), Contrarian Thinking)

In today's world, our ability to communicate online is 100X our ability to communicate person to person. You don't have to be a great public speaker. You don't have to get your face everywhere in order for your words to spread like wildfire. 
Then how do you do this? You do this by your ability to write, and your ability to write with a purpose.

Copywriting is writing with an outcome in mind, as opposed to just writing by making beautiful turn of phrases. 



- Find your inner voice. You should make sure that you repel people that are not right for your brand, and attract people that are right for your brand

- Then focus on distribution:
	- find a few people that are your true fans and make sure that they get a lot of value from you
	- that often means a free newsletter for at least a year
	- I find similar audiences to mine and I try to serve them. Try to find someone else's audience and steal a bit of their attention. For Codie that was a group called The Hustle and Trends. Source https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=999rMfWAtzw
