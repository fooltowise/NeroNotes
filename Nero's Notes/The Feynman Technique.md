There are four simple steps to the Feynman technique:

1. Pick and study a topic.
2. Take out a blank sheet of paper and write at the top the subject you want to learn. Write out what you know about the subject as if you were teaching it to someone who is unfamiliar with the topic. Not your smart adult friend, but rather a ten-year-old who can just about understand basic concepts and relationships.
3. When you must use simple language that a child can understand, you force yourself to understand the concept at a deeper level and to simplify relationships and connections between ideas. If you struggle, you have a clear understanding of where you have some gaps. This is valuable feedback, because you have now discovered the edge of your mental capabilities. *Knowing the limits of  your knowledge is the dawning of wisdom.*
4. Return to the source material, reread and relearn it. Repeat step 2 and compile information that will help you fill in the gaps in your understanding identified in step 3. Review and simplify further as necessary.
