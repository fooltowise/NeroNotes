# What are the economics of our purchase of shares in Costco?

Analysis of the annual report (disgraceful lack of color pictures) reveals that revenues of $47.2bn (year to August 2004) represented a 12% mark up on "merchandising costs" and left enough to pay for operating costs (SG&A) pf 9.8% of sales (one third of the hi-lo supermarkets). Profits from retailing are therefore around $456m per annum to which one should add the membership fees of $961m = $1.41bn, pre-taxes.

Taxes approximate depreciation most years, so pre-tax income equates to gross cash flow before maintenance capex which at around $250m per annum implies around $1.17bn in free cash flow as a cash cow. 

This compares to a fixed asset base of company owned real estate of $9.6bn (depreciated value $7.3bn). Working capital is "supplier funded" and means that the $1.17bn free cash flow represents a yield of around 12% on fixed assets. 

A bear argument is that if the real estate was leased, free cash flow would be nought: this looks right but may miss two things: (1) rents provide a return to their owners, not just break even on the cost of capital and (2) the store base is under-earning, perhaps significantly. Evidence for this is as follows: revenue per store at the oldest stores is twice this year's new openings, revenues at the oldest stores are still rising at 3 to 4% per annum, costs per new store suffers from low capacity utilization of warehouses, and penetration in California is six times US state average.

Store growth will be around 5% per annum and management confess to "always under-estimate saturation": in LA post the merger with Price Club in 1993 they thought 31 stores were two many for the market, but today there are 36. Likewise, in Seattle and Alaska the penetration of cards (membership) is 65% of households (gosh) but in most markets it is below 10%. Not also that one third of the store base remains in California, and almost half on the West Coast. This is a very young franchise.

Half of the store base is over ten years old and earns 65% of the revenues whilst using approximately 40% of the asset base. What this means is that the oldest stores earn around 16.5% on assets and the youngest earn 6%. In other words, there is an approximate 50% rise in aggregate profits to come as the store base matures (4% growth per annum), plus same store sales growth at the mature stores (approx. 4% per annum), implying 8% growth before new store openings, which will add 5% to the store base and can easily be funded through free cash flow. This suggest normalized growth of 13%, and I don't think it is a stretch.

How do we think about valuation? There is a range of possible outcomes for the business, some are more likely than others and, in our mind, they have various probabilities attached. What we present below is our assessment of central value for Costco, but you should bear in mind that it is not the only value for Costco. Our average purchase price of $39 per share (a blend of $30 per share when the Partnership was small, and $40 per share following the draw down of the Nomad subscription queue in the summer) discounts modest growth of 5 to 6% per annum and is too low for a business that will be pushed not to grow earning 10% per annum.

A price of $43 per share discounts 7% growth and $85 to $90 per share 15% growth. There is a very real possibility that the business could be priced to discount growth of 10% which would imply a price of $62 per share today (and that price should rise by our 10% discount rate per annum).

If it takes five years for the shares to converge on a price which discounts 10% growth per annum, then the shares would need to rise by 20% per annum from our average purchase price of $39 per share.


Such a gain would add around 2%  per annum to Partnership assets. And it is this that makes me think the weighting in the portfolio is too small. If Dell is the appropriate model for Costco, then the probability of failure is lower than for most growth stocks. it is lower again when one considers self-funded, as opposed to, rented growth. And lower again when one considers the fixity of mark up. To a far greater extent than for many businesses the company controls its own destiny. So. what attracted us to Costco is the predictability of the outcome: we don't think it is going to fail for many years. But is a 2% gain per annum optimal? If one applies the Kelly criterion, the weighting should be much higher. So already your manager may have made his first mistake investing in Costco. From not buying enough. Perhaps I will get my opportunity to make amends.
