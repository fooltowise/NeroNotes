In general, the survival of a population does not coincide with the survival of its members, not all of them.

For a mother, her child is irreplaceable. For the species, natural selection means an improvement.

For a soldier, his life and those of his squad brothers are irreplaceable. For a general, losing a few soldiers is a painful cost that might be worth paying to win the war.


**For an employee, his career and health are irreplaceable. For the company, most employees are replaceable. Firings and employee burnouts are part of doing business.**

As an employee, does non-ergodicity apply to the relationship between you and your company? If yes, you must acknowledge that you and your company might have different incentives. You'd better take one or two actions. One realign incentives - for example, by becoming irreplaceable. Two acknowledge that you might need a Plan B.



**What's best for the survival of the individual is not necessarily what's best for the survival of its population, and the other way around.**
