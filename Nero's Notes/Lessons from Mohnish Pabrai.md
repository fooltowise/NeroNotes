# Lessons from [[Mohnish Pabrai]]

- Humans have something weird in their DNA that prevents them from adopting good ideas easily. To be a great cloner, you have to check your ego at the door.
- There are no prizes for frenetic activity. Rather, investing is mostly a matter of waiting for these rare moments when the odds of making money vastly outweigh the odds of losing it.
- The key principles are not that difficult to identify and clone: *Be patient and selective, saying no to almost everything. Exploit the market's bipolar mood swings. Buy stocks at a big discount to their underlying value. Stay within your circle of competence. Avoid anything too hard. Make a small number of mispriced bets with minimal downside and significant upside.*
- If you're even a slightly above average investor who spends less than you earn, over a lifetime you cannot help but get very wealthy.
- Diplomacy is not his strong point, but Pabrai regards truthfulness as a higher concern. In the late nineties, he read a book titled *Power vs. Force: The Hidden Determinants of Human Behavior* by David Hawkins, which Pabrai describes as "a huge part of what I believe in." Hawkins argue that true power stems from traits such as honesty, compassion, and a dedication to enhancing other people's lives. These powerful "attractors" have an unconscious effect on people, making them "go strong", whereas traits such as dishonesty, fear, and shame make them "go weak". Pabrai took one specific lesson from Hawkins and determined to live by it. "**You can't get away with lying to other humans**", says Pabrai, "**and that's a very profound idea**."
- What's most remarkable is Pabrai's unshakable consistency in sticking to such principles. "When you encounter these truths that other people don't understand, you just have to latch on to them big-time", he says. "Anytime you get a truth that humanity doesn't understand, that's a huge competitive advantage. Humanity doesn't understand *Power vs Force.*"
- Compounding is a very simple idea. Cloning is a very simple idea. Telling the truth is a very simple idea. But when you apply a handful of powerful ideas with obsessive fervor, the cumulative effect becomes unbeatable.

- "Once you have a sense that life is meaningless, what should you do? Not fuck up life for other people. Leave the planet a better place than you found it. Do a good job with your kids. The rest of it is a game. It doesn't matter."


## Lessons from Mohnish

1. Clone like crazy.
2. Hang out with people who are better than you.
3. Treat life as a game, not as a survival contest or a battle to death.
4. Be in alignment with who you are; don't do what you don't want to do or what's not right for you.
5. Live by an inner scorecard; don't worry about what others think of you; don't be defined by external validation.
6. **Take a simple idea and take it seriously.**



"On my gravestone, I want them to write, 'He loved to play games, especially games he knew he could win.' Cloning is a game. Blackjack is a game. Bridge is a game. Dakshana is a game. And, of course, the stock market is a game. It's just a bunch of games. It's all about the odds."
