# Tactics to Counter Mimetic Desire

## 1) Name your models

Naming anything - whether it's emotions, problems, or talents - gives us more control. the same is true for models.

Who are your models at work? At home? who are the people influencing your buying decisions, your career path, your politics?

Some models are easy to name. They are what we typically think of as "role models" - people or groups we find exemplary, people we want to emulate in a positive way. We're not ashamed to acknowledge them.

Others we don't think of as models. Take fitness. A personal trainer is more than a coach - she is a model of desire. She wants something for you that you do not yet want for yourself enough to do what you need to do. The important shift is seeing people in more than their professional role but also in their role as an influencer of desire. This appliers to your children's teachers, your colleagues, and your friends.

Harder to name are the people who come from inside our world and who might be modeling rivalrous or unhealthy behaviors - the people around whom we orbit without knowing it, who affect what we want. Here's one way to identify them: think seriously about the people you least want to succeed.

## 2) Find sources of wisdom that withstand mimesis

Experts play an increasingly prominent role in our society. But what makes an expert? A degree? A podcast? Increasingly, experts are crowned mimetically, like fashion.

Because there is less and less agreement about cultural values and even about the value of science itself (consider the debates about climate change), people find "experts" whose expertise is largely a produce of mimetic validation. It's critical to cut through mimesis and find sources of knowledge that are less subject to mimesis.

Find sources that have stood the test of time. Be wary of self-proclaimed and crowd-proclaimed experts.

It's less likely that experts will be mimetically chosen in the hard sciences (physics, math, chemistry) because people have to show their work, But it's easy for someone to become an overnight expert on "productivity" merely because they got published in the right place. Scientism fools people because it is a mimetic game dressed up as science.

The key is carefully curating our sources of knowledge so that we are able to get down to what is true regardless of how many other people want to believe it. And that means doing the work.

### 3) Create boundaries with unhealthy models

You probably follow at least a few people who function as unhealthy models of desire for you. It might be an acquaintance or former colleague, someone you follow on social media, or maybe even a former classmate whose career you've followed through the years. YOu need to know what they're up to. You care what they think. You care what they want.

It's critical to distance yourself form the force they exert on you. Unfollow them. Don't ask about them. If you check up on them every day, then start by going at least a week before you check again. If you check on them every week, then go at least a month.

One of my friends was an early employee at a start-up in San Francisco when he found himself in a highly mimetic relationship with a talented colleague. The company grew so fast that there were a few months when they had to work nearly around the clock to keep up. If his rival Slacked the team to say that he was finally leaving the office at ten o'clock at night, my buddy would stay until ten-thirty the next night - and let everyone know about it. (It reminded me of my early days in investment banking, when none of the analysts dared to be the first one to leave for the day, lest anyone think they weren't working hard.)

It wasn't long before both my friend and his rival were pulling all-nighters. Not because the work demanded it, but because their mimetic rivalry did. Each one wanted to win the war.

Finally, my friend's rival left and became the eponymous founder of a company. Three months later, so did my friend. (He saw an "opportunity in the market", of course, around the exact time that his rival did.)

For months he followed the other guy's company and social media posts daily. He wouldn't admit to anyone, including himself, that his every move depended on what the other guy did.

For months he followed the other guy's company and social media posts daily. He wouldn't admit to anyone, including himself, that his every move depended on what the other guy did.

When his rival bought Bitcoin, he had to buy Bitcoin, too, to make sure the other guy didn't hit a home run and leave him behind. My friend was like an investment manager who only buys index funds to ensure that he never falls behind the market, because that would be embarrassing.  People do the same thing with their models.

When the Bitcoin bubble burst, my friend didn't care. As long as the other guy was wrong, he could be wrong, too.

Eight years have passed since they first struck out on their own. One day last year I ran across a news article profiling the rival and sent it to my friend. "Hey, look what Tony is up to," I wrote. To my surprise, my friend responded courteously: "Thanks for sending me this. I deleted it immediately. About a year ago, I completely untethered myself from Tony to the point where I no longer even know what he's up to, and I'd like to keep it that way. Someday, once my rivalry with him runs out of oxygen and dies, I might not mind. But for now, I'm starving it to death. Can you do me a favor and not send me stuff like this?"

I was happy not to. And today my friend is happier, too.

## 4) Use Imitation To Drive Innovation

There's a false dichotomy between imitation and innovation.

They're part of the same process of discovery. Some of history's most creative geniuses started off by simply imitating the right model.

I sat down with Naresh Ramchandani, a partner at Pentagram, consistently ranked as one of the most innovative design firms in the world. They're the creative force behind projects such as the Harley-Davidson museum, the set and on-screen graphics of the *Daily Show*, and the One Laptop per Child initiative.

"You can do innovation at any stage," Naresh tells me. "We sometimes start by saying," "What's out there? What can we copy?" The innovation comes at ta later stage of the creative process.

If someone's primary objective is innovation for the sake of innovation, they usually end up in a mimetic rivalry with everyone in their field to compete primarily on the basis of originality. By devaluing all forms of imitation, they play a game of differentiation to get noticed. Being different for the sake of being different is the ethos behind shock-value art and academics whose salient feature is making outlandish claims to stand out from the pack.

As the fastest way to humility is not thinking more about humility but thinking less frequently of oneself, the safest route to innovation is also an indirect one. "There's great stuff out there", Ramchandani says. "Why wouldn't we learn from it? Why wouldn't we use it as an example, and build something on top of that rather than alongside it?"

Austin Kleon, the author of *Steal like an artist*, put it this way: "If we're free form the burden of trying to be completely original, we can stop trying to make something out of nothing, and we can embrace influence instead of running away from it."

Know when to lean into mimesis.

## 5) Start Positive Flywheels of Desire

Desire is a path-dependent process. The choices we make today affect the things we'll want tomorrow. That's why it's important to map out, the best we can, the consequences of our actions on our future desires.

Start by thinking seriously about what a positive cycle of desire might look for you. Start with the core desire. It might be spending more time with your kids, having more leisure time, or writing a book. then map out a system of desire that makes it easier to bring that core desire to fulfillment.

Write it out. I suggest that each step in the flywheel be one sentence, contain the word "want" (or "desire"), and link to the next step in the process with a connector like "so that", or "which leads to", or "which makes".

Here's an example from an e-commerce company that put a positive flywheel in motion for its customer service team, which had become complacent and unmotivated:

1. We want our customer service team to feel empowered to take ownership of decisions, so that
2. Customers feel they are speaking to someone with authority and therefore want to interact with them rather than asking for a manager, so that
3. Efficiencies are created that allow managers to spend less time talking to frustrated customers and more time managing projects they want to be working on, so that
4. We can create a discretionary bonus pool, administered by managers who want to reward customer service team members who take ownership of decisions, so that
5. The customer service team members want to take more ownership of decisions.

Your doesn't need to have five steps. But make sure that each step leads inevitably to the next, and that the last step in the process leads back to the first.


## 6) Establish and communicate a clear hierarchy of values

See  [[Top 5 Personal Values]]

A hierarchy of values is an antidote to mimetic conformity. If all values are treated as equal, then the one that wins out - especially at a time of crisis - is the one that is most mimetic. During the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, there was panic-buying of toilet paper. There was no issue with supply; there was an issue with mimesis. Cultural values are often subject to the same irrationality - people tend to panic-buy whatever is most important to them at the moment rather than what is best for the common good.

It's not enough to name values. They need to be ranked. When all values are the same, nothing is being valued at all. It's like highlighting every single word in a book.

It's better to construct a mental model of your hierarchy of values (or your shared values, if you are in a relationship). Map it out on paper. encourage your company to do the same. That hierarchy can change as time goes on. But by stratifying your values, you will be able to weigh and measure options when you have to make decisions in complex situations.

Remember that conflict is caused by sameness, not by difference. If everything is equally good or important, the propensity for conflict is higher. Don't contribute to the tyranny of relativism. It has too many tyrants as it is.

A lack of clear, prioritized values in many companies allows mimesis  to hijack the concept of corporate social responsibility and turn it into a flaccid marketing gimmick. It's not that the values espoused by CSR are not important. But one gets the feeling that even "social responsibility" has become a mimetic, virtue-signaling game - more "social" than responsible. Avoid that by establishing and communicating both your values and their relative importance. 

Some values are absolutes. Know them. Name them. Defend them. They make up the base of the pyramid, or the center of your concentric circles (depending on how you choose to depict the hierarchy.)

## 7) Arrive at Judgments in anti-mimetic ways

If you're taking a poll or a vote in a public place, it's essential that people cannot see how other people are voting - if you want anything resembling a true, pre-mimetic reflection of what people think, that is. The mimetic influences are too strong. It's important to find ways to allow each member of a group to arrive at a verdict - whether it be an investment decision or that of a court-room jury - through the most independent process possible

## 8) Map out the systems of desire in your world

Every industry, every school, every family has a particular system of desire that makes certain things more or less desirable. Know which systems of desire you're living in. There's probably more than one.

Entrepreneur and VC Marc Andreessen, in an April 2020 post on his company's website titled "It's time to build", wonders how so many Western countries were unprepared - from a production standpoint - for the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. At one point, there were serious shortages of ventilators, test kits, cotton swabs, even hospital gowns. The complacency and malaise seemed to extend to many other domains, even before the pandemic - to education, manufacturing, transportation. Why were Americans not longer building the things of the future? he asked.

The problem is not capital or competence or even a lack of awareness of what's needed. "The problem is desire", Andreessen wrote. "We need to 'want' those things." But he acknowledges that there are forces in place that prevent us from wanting to build the things we need: regulatory capture, industry incumbents, stalemate politics. "The problem is inertia," he continued. "We need to want these things more than we want to prevent these things."

Crippled systems of desire, unable to adapt, have made it so that we gravitate toward the path of least resistance - monetizing Youtube videos  of people reacting to other Youtube videos, for instance - and lack the will to build the essential tools needed for human survival and flourishing.

If you understand the systems of desire that color the choices of people around you, you're more likely to see emergent possibilities by daring to look in different directions.

Make visible what is invisible. Mark the boundaries of your current world of wanting, and you'll gain the ability - at least the possibility - to transcend it.

## 9) Put desires to the test

Don't take desires at face value: Find out where they lead.

Sit with competing desires and project them into the future. Let's say you have two competing jobs offers: Company A and Company B. If you have two days to make the final decision, spend one day in each company in your imagination. On the first day, imagine with as much detail as possible that you're working at Company A and fulfilling the desires that come along with that position- maybe it's living in a new city, interacting with smart people, and being closer to your family. Pay close attention to your emotions and what's going on inside your gut. The next day, spend the entire day doing the same thing, except at Company B. Compare.

The ultimate way to test desires - especially major life choices such as whtehr to marry someone or whether to quit your job and start your company - is to practice this same exercise but to do it while imagining yourself on your deathbed. Which choices leaves you more consoled? Which choice causes you more agitation? Steve Jobs, in his 2005 commencement speech at Stanford, noted, "Death is very likely the single best invention of life. It clears out the old to make way for the new." The deathbed is where unfulfilling desires are exposed. Transport yourself there now rather than waiting until later, when it might be too late.

## 10) Share stories of deeply fulfilling actions

Most people are rarely, if ever, asked to tell the stories of their deeply fulfilling achievements. We have to mine them, intentionally, in ourselves and in others. The exercise of telling, listening to, and documenting these stories opens up new windows of empathy and the discovery of thick desires.

Sharing fulfillment stories is like making a biographical sketch of how desires were born and took shape for yourself, for your colleagues, and for your entire organization. Knowing how others are motivated leads to a greater sense of connectedness and the possibility of organizing teams in a way that maximizes their motivational energy - because each member on the team is engaged in action that they are inherently motivated to do.


## 11) Invest in Deep Silence

Set aside at least three consecutive days every year for a personal silent retreat. No talking, no screens, no music. Only books. Deep silence is the kind of silence you enter into when the echoes and comforts of normal noise have completely receded and you are alone with yourself.  A five-day retreat is ideal because often the noise of the world doesn't fully recede from our minds until the end of the third day (and the major benefits of the silence flow once that has happened) - but three days is a good place to start.

Find a special place for it. The further you are removed from the noise of everyday life (like ambulance sirens and horns, if you live in a city), the better.

You may want to consider a directed silent retreat during which retreat directors five short reflections and curate the experience to an individual or group - these reflections or readings are the only time the silence is broken. This can be easily adapted for corporate silent retreats, where the meditations and reflection questions can be aligned with the organizational purpose.

## 12) Look for the coexistence of opposites

To cut through ideology, it helps to pay attention to what in Latin are called *coincidentia oppositorum* - the coincidence, or coexistence, of opposites : paradoxical figures, walking contradictions. People who are both meek and bold at the same time, humble and confident, or who utterly confound expectations. People or things or experiences that make us scratch our head and say, "Wait, those things are not supposed to coexist."

These coincidences of opposites point to something transcendent. The reason things seem like they should not coexist is that they don't map onto how I experience the world. They don't have a place on my map of meaning, my mental model of how the world works. They are a sign that I need to go further, to reevaluate, to press deeper. They point to something beyond where I'm currently at.

Wise people have said that it's best to compare yourself only to who you were yesterday, not to who other people are today. That's a good start for escaping the trap of comparison and measurement.

But it's not enough. The person I was yesterday is not a model I can imitate. I can only look back at him (and usually, in my case, shake my head).

What I need is a model of the future - a transcendent model, where there are no more paradoxes of opposites, where there are no more contradictions, when my desires aren't in constant, unresolvable tension. We all do.

The coexistence of opposites is often a sign, pointing us in the right direction.

## 13) Live as if you have a responsibility for what other people want

Through our relationships, we help other people with their wants in one of three ways: we help them want more, we help them want less, or we help them want differently.

There is no person we encounter - not even in the most uninteresting interaction of our day - whom we do not help desire in one of these three ways. The changes are usually imperceptible. But like a giant flywheel, we are gently nudging other people's desires in one or another direction.

Living with an awareness of mimetic desire brings with it the responsibility to defuse rivalry and to model positive desires in small ways daily.
