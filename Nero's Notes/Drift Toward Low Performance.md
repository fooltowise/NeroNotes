## Description:

It occurs when we allow performance standards to be influenced by past performances, especially when there is a negative bias in the perception of past performances. Then a reinforcing feedback loop is setup, and the system drifts toward low performances.

## Solution:

One must keep absolute performance standards. Even better, let them be enhanced by actual best performances instead of being discouraged by worse performances. Keep the same structure to setup a drift toward high performances!
