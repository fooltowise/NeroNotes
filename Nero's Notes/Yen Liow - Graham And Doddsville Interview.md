**Graham & Doddsville (G&D) :** Could you start by discussing your background and how you got into this business? 

**Yen Liow (YL) :** I'm Malaysian-Chinese Australian. I was born in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, but I immigrated to Melbourne, Australia in 1976 when I was four years old. My dad was a dentist and my mom was a teacher. They didn't know much about business, but I fell in love with it at a really young age. My best friend's father was a gentleman named Peter Gunn; he was a self-made transportation magnate in Australia and I was very fortunate that he took me under his wing and became one of my key mentors when I was young. At the age of 15, Peter essentially helped inspire the next 25 years of my life.


I started working when I was 14. I worked every summer and took every opportunity I could find to learn about business. It was mostly a lot of manual jobs that eventually led to professional internships and opportunities. I bought my first stock when I was 14 (it was Santos, an Australian Oil & Gas company) and have been investing ever since. 

For my undergraduate studies, I did a double degree at the University of Melbourne in Commerce and Law. I originally started with a triple degree – I also studied Actuarial Sciences for the first few years – but I wised up to the fact that it was far too much work and I wanted to have some fun. 

After that I went to Bain & Company. I started off in their Sydney office and then went to their San Francisco, Singapore and Beijing offices over the course of five years. Bain was an amazing, diverse set of practical experiences. But the most important part for my development was the two years that I spent consulting with Dell Computers. Dell's stock price grew tenfold over that period. I learned an unbelievable amount about hyper-growth and what world-class execution looks like, which had an important impact on my focus and philosophy as an investor. After Bain, I went to Harvard Business School where I graduated as a Baker Scholar in 2001.

During the summer in between my first and second year at business school, right at the peak of the dot-com bubble, the startup that I was interning at shut down. I was fortunate to get a summer internship at Ziff Brothers Investments for the remainder of the summer. 

Ziff Brothers really opened my eyes to the professional investing world. I thought hedge funds were traders, which was not appealing at all to me. What I found at Ziff was a great group of people who did deep and creative research. Ziff had a learning culture in which I spent the next 13 years helping to build an amazing business. Eventually I ran their Technology Media Telecom, Agriculture, and Energy groups. 

Ian McKinnon was the portfolio manager there. He was one of the greatest human beings, coaches and mentors one could ever wish to work for. Ian had a huge impact on my career and remains a close friend. While I was with Ziff Brothers, I also had the opportunity to spend time with Eddie Lampert, who opened my eyes to case studies. I asked him how he developed such an incredible business acumen so early in his life, and he shared with me that he spent a substantial part of his twenties and thirties purposefully training by studying the best investments in history through a [[case study]] methodology. I took that on. 

We started doing cases internally at Ziff and taught our approach at Harvard Business School in 2008, and continued the process at Columbia Business School in 2013. The [[case study]] methodology was the most important part of my personal development and is one of the cornerstones of Aravt Global's creation.

In 2013, I was a bit over 40 and I had to scratch the itch - to find out what it would be like running my own investment firm. So, in February 2014, we launched Aravt Global.


**G&D :** What's the inspiration behind the name? 


**YL :** Aravt means the number “ten” in Mongolian, which was the smallest unit in Genghis Khan's army and represent our humble beginnings. Genghis Khan's army had 200,000 cavalrymen who conquered 10 million square miles of the Earth over 30 years in the 13th century. 

This is relevant to investing because you can't do something of that scale by picking fair fights. You can'´t just do common things. The central premise of Genghis Khan's strategy was unfair fights. Genghis Khan was successful because he hated putting his men in harm's way, and that is the first principle of Aravt Global. We just don't back situations where the win rate is even. You can't compound capital if the odds are not well in your favor. We're looking for unfair fights, where a company's advantage is substantial and repeatable.


**G&D :** Can you talk a little bit about the other principles that guide Aravt Global? 

**YL :** Albert Einstein said that compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe. We agree – we think compounding is the most important framework in investing. Our business model, portfolio and structure is built around it. We focus on horses, a sub-genre of durable compounders that grow more briskly than the broader market. 

Over ten years ago, my team did a deep empirical study on stocks that compounded at north of 20% on five- and ten-year rolling periods over the last three decades to try to understand what drove performance. We wanted to deeply understand the patterns and if they could be repeated.

This led to over a decade of examination and dissection through the [[case study]] methodology. Over the past few years, we have integrated that knowledge into the processes and culture that define how we approach our business. Let me share a few of the elements with you. 

**The first and most important element is game selection.** We had to decide where to focus our efforts. 

Most of the market will revert to the mean over time. That is one of the most important laws of economics – that excess profits get eroded away by competition. We focus on the small percentage of stocks that resist those forces, primarily economic monopolies and functional oligopolies. That is where we spend all our time and resources. The inefficiency we exploit is the absence of mean reversion. 

When I started my career, I thought I needed the largest possible investment universe to find opportunities. We have learned that in fact the opposite is true. We needed to find a rich vein of repeatable inefficiency in a finite universe that we could focus on, so when price dislocation occurs we could exploit it. When the universe is too big, that is an unachievable goal. At least it was for me.

What we focus on is durable growth businesses that can compound free cash flow or earnings per share at a healthy rate, which we describe as between 15% and 25%. Durable growth businesses are more predictable businesses. As investors, we are studying history to try to predict the future. In situations that are highly dynamic, which I would define as lower quality businesses or lower quality industry structures, there is a loose link between history and the future. As such, your ability to predict is low, regardless of how many hours you spend researching. 

When you spend your time in durable businesses that are highly moated, the opposite is true. Our job is to find situations where history does hold, and to constantly ensure that new dynamics do not jeopardize the durability of that moat. When the moat breaks down, our ability to predict breaks down. When our ability to predict breaks down, it is hard to know what to do with volatility. Is it opportunity or is it risk? Our portfolio is highly durable and easier (but still not easy) to predict. When volatility hits, at worst we hold through, and at best we exploit it. It's a profoundly different place, and that is all about game selection. Simply put, our stocks may be volatile at times, but our businesses, in general, are not. 

**In game selection, we also focus on the replication phase of a business life cycle. There are three stages we view as the life cycle of a normal business: proof of concept, replication and maturation. The first phase has explosive outcomes, both up and down. It is very hard to predict however, with very wide outcomes. We focus on the second phase: on businesses that have won their niche and can replicate over long periods of time.**

The second element is ***systems design***. We've created a firm, a culture and a process to support our game selection. Great systems design allows for engineering tolerance. When we are dealing with capital markets, we need to have tolerance for a lot of imponderables – mistakes, randomness, stress – but still be able to perform. Our organization is built around purposeful preparation and error minimization. 

Built into that systems design is having a purposeful culture. None of us have a Bloomberg terminal. We have an outsourced trader, in Vancouver. We don't generally trade the same day we make decisions. These are culturally important factors. We have four analysts on our team, plus me as the portfolio manager. We only need a few great ideas each year for our portfolio to stay healthy and well-stocked. There is no need for immediate reactions on anything that we do. There was a 20 month period where we only bought one stock. It is really hard to build a culture and process where the whole team deeply understands the important distinction between intense research activity and value-added portfolio activity.

After another detailed study of market returns three years ago, we cut off both tails in our portfolio. Specifically, we don't pursue the extreme upside one-year stocks, because we don't need to - we found that tremendous short-term downside risk exists there, and it usually doesn't let us size and stay well-invested for long periods of time. We adjusted our focus to the compounders that can still compound at 20%, 30% or 40%, and where we can be bigger for many years. We still get the occasional up 75% to 100% stock in a year, but our performance is not dependent on it.

This brings us to the third area, which is **portfolio concentration**. We developed a search algorithm that narrows our universe of 3,000 or so stocks into a far more defined universe of 200-300 companies that qualify for what we do. We then deploy capital into the best 15-20 of those ideas. This concentrated portfolio allows us to hold the bar high and be patient in deploying our work. 

**G&D :** How does valuation play into your approach? 

**YL :** **Valuation discipline is the fourth element**. We don't invest in all types of growth stocks, but in a specific type that we call 20/20s: 20x forward earnings for 20% intrinsic value per share growth. Now, obviously valuation is not as simple as that and 20/20s is not all that we do, but it is the central tendency of our portfolio. One central premise we believe is that over time, the compounding of our long portfolio will revert to the underlying earnings power growth of the businesses we own. If we have done our underwriting well, the 20/20s will not only give us downside protection into volatile markets, but also the room to stay deeply engaged with our large investments for many years, which I believe is the hardest part of riding horses.

While valuation multiples matter a lot in the short-term – they drive stock performance tremendously in years one through three – in years three and beyond, the impact of a change in multiples, unless extreme, fades when it comes to long-term capital compounding. 


**The fifth element is duration and capture.** All of what I've described allows us to hold our investments for long periods of time. We focus on growth stories that can replicate for many years on end. Roughly a third of our portfolio is almost five years old (the age of our fund), a third is two-and-a-half to five years old and a third is younger than two-and-a-half years. The 20/20s combined with our game selection allow us to be sized bigger in our names and stay big for long periods of time. Four of our five oldest investments are still in our top five largest holdings, and all five are within our top ten. 

One of the important benefits of duration is tax-efficiency, which really adds to our limited partner's total return over time. It also allows us to have tremendous return on time, which is my next point.

Once you pull all of this together, we're given a lot more time to do our work in the diligence process, which is area number six. Our portfolio construction allows us to spend many months on individual ideas. Our process is both quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative components involve breaking down all our theses into clear articulations of growth drivers and what we're playing for over long periods of time. 

Qualitative research involves a tremendous amount of primary research. We do our own primary research in house, are supplemented by investigative journalists and have an in-house forensic accountant. We are comfortable spending a lot of time on our research as we believe if we've selected the ideas well upfront in our process, then it's a question of when – not if – our inventory gets deployed into our live portfolio.

Contrast that with a high velocity portfolio, where the work that you do becomes obsolete quickly. Our insights compound and can stay fresh in our actionable inventory for many years on end. That builds patience into our process, but it also permits us to spend a tremendous amount of time on our research.

The final element is ***training***. We train deeply, as investing is a game that never ends or stops adapting. We compare investing to a professional full-contact sport, and all professional sports have a high training-to-playing ratio. We think it's absolutely critical to have a high training-to-playing ratio. We train a tremendous amount, and I still think it's not enough. 

The case studies I mentioned are an integral part of our training. We generally don't do investment case studies on a single case basis. We're looking for patterns, not single idiosyncratic outcomes. Clusters of cases are very important, and we generally do them in batches of three to six. Contrast learning is also very important, as understanding the counter case will highlight even more what the differences were.


**G&D:** How do you evaluate management and how does it fit into your investment process?

**YL :** Management is very important to us, because management is the allocator of all of a firm's resources and, over a five- or ten-year holding period, they've allocated the majority of the capital of a firm. We look for specific factors in assessing management, with the simplest test being ethics. Are we dealing with an ethical management team? Do they have a reputation for doing shareholder unfriendly things? The term we use is: is the management team handshake worthy or not? 

One mistake I made earlier in my career was investing in questionable management teams, believing that a cheap valuation more than made up for management. We just don't expose ourselves to that risk anymore and seek to invest in and support high quality people.


**G&D :** Do you hedge your long portfolio with shorts? 

**YL :** Our long and short portfolios are each designed to be standalone portfolios and not hedges, pair-trades, or specific offsets. We look to create a portfolio of high-quality ideas on both sides. Indeed, we are in the early stages of launching a long only strategy. 

**G&D :** How does the broader economy factor into the investment decision process? 

**YL :** I think the first and most important rule in risk management is awareness. Macro tells us what kind of environment we are currently in, but it's difficult to predict macro outcomes and a low return on effort. However, trying to understand where we are in the cycle informs broad risk positioning and tells us how much of our balance sheet we should deploy at the edges. But we are fundamentally bottoms-up in filling our portfolio.


**G&D :** Does your process change at all in environments like Q4 of last year? Is there more of an added incentive or rush to get into names when you see that the market's down 10%, 12% in a quarter? 

**YL :** Absolutely. We bought three stocks in one day. We did not put the entire positions on in one day, but we started slowly loading positions as soon as we saw the market get emotional and the IRRs becoming attractive. So, yes, we bought a lot of stocks in the fourth quarter last year. This was unusual for us and, again, we don't really need to. But software went on sale, so we picked up a few stocks that came into our strike zone. Our process allows us to act if we are provoked. 

That's also why we focus so much on training. It's one thing to have implicit gut instincts, but it's another thing to have explicit knowledge. Case studies and deep pattern recognition let you take the implicit and make it explicit. In our business, the toughest moments happen at the bottom of the [[Nike]] swoosh, when the stock price of one of our investments is under a lot of pressure. In that moment, is it opportunity or is it risk? The more explicit you make implicit insights, the better you will be able to take appropriate action and think clearly during times of stress. Trust me, it is still really hard at those moments, but at least you have a fighting chance. 

**G&D :** With the market now back around all-time highs, do you find the current landscape for finding long ideas much tougher than it was maybe three or four months ago? 

**YL :** Well, three or four months ago it was amazing. But we're still finding interesting ideas, and frankly the best part about what we do, again going back to our systems, is that we don't need to find many. As long as there's durable growth at reasonable prices, we can engage – or not at all. We are happy owning what we've got. We don't have to buy a single stock. There's nothing forcing our hand; our portfolio should continue to compound healthily. We're comfortable with our visibility of it. Will it get hit in a recession? Of course, it'll get hit in a recession. But can we hold through in a recession? We can hold through in a recession.


**G&D :** Do you have any new positions in your portfolio that you think are really good examples of “horses” – durable compounders that you think can grow 20% or 30%? 

**YL :** One investment that we made last year is Black Knight (NYSE: BKI), which is a SaaS company in the U.S. mortgage servicing industry. When you get a statement with what you owe on your mortgage, your balance etc. – it may be a Bank of America loan, but it's operating on Black Knight's software. The business was originally formed in the 1960s, but was fully spun off from [[Fidelity National Financial]] (NYSE: FNF) in 2017. 

We believe Black Knight has a near monopolistic position in mortgage servicing software, which is over 80% of total EBITDA. It has three basic business lines. The first is mortgage servicing software, in which it has 62% market share in first-lien mortgages, going to 70% and 19% market share in second-lien mortgages, going to 30%. There is a runway for continued market share gains in both segments, but especially in second-lien. It also has mortgage origination software where it's the second largest third-party platform after Ellie Mae. The final business line is a solid data and analytics business that competes against CoreLogic. We love subscription-based business models. Why? Because they are generally easier to predict and project. 

We love subscription growth businesses and this is one of the best we have seen. Black Knight is also the lowest churn subscription business we own, which is also a very strong indicator of business quality. In the last 10 years, only one significant customer left its platform (post GFC), and that customer recently came back to Black Knight after years of trying to do it internally. It also has strong pricing power, high returns on capital and an amazing management team. 

One of the reasons we invested now is that we're in the midst of a once-in-a-generation regulatory change. Post-GFC, the government significantly increased regulations for mortgage servicing and originations. This increased compliance cost and increased risk of immense fines for non-compliance actually increased Black Knight's competitive advantage. 

Additionally, Black Knight's software is regarded as the heart and lungs of many bank's mortgage operations. It's very painful, if not nearly impossible, to rip it out and replace. We love businesses that are deeply embedded in its customer's businesses. 

All of this is being combined under a new leader, Anthony Jabbour. Anthony was previously the COO at Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE: FIS) and has the experience of running a business multiple times the size of Black Knight. We think the world of him. He's ethical, aligned, capable and hungry. Moreover, the chairman of Black Knight is Bill Foley, who's a legendary capital allocator who has compounded capital at high teens for over three decades. We think the combination of Bill and Anthony puts us in a position of tremendous stewardship at a reasonable valuation. 

Black Knight trades at 24x 2020 EPS, compounding its value per share at high teens. We think that endures for many years to come.

**G&D :** When you are looking at a software company, do you sit down and actually test the software out?

**YL :** In general, yes, we try to take a first-person look at the software. But frankly, we're not making judgments on the quality of the software. We don't believe that's an edge. Even if we got the most experienced software developer to tell us if it's a good or bad design, that's only part of the equation in software businesses. Sales and distribution is equally as important as the product itself.

Black Knight's  software is relatively older than some of its peers – it's one of the original SaaS companies, actually – but it's just so sticky… it's not something that banks can easily change. We're trying to understand software from the client's  perspective which gives us insight into its pricing power, stickiness and distribution model. 

**G&D :** How dependent is this business on the housing cycle? 

**YL :** Black Knight has almost no correlation with the housing cycle. While mortgage originations obviously move up and down, the vast majority of Black Knight's revenue is based on the number of mortgages (i.e. stock) which is very consistent and normally grows 1-2% per year. Even into deep cyclical troughs, like today, the negative revenue impact on Black Knight is quite minimal. Even on the mortgage origination side, which is 6% of revenue, Black Knight has contractual minimums. The balance sheet is levered around three times, which enhances equity returns, but it's a business that can handle leverage. 

**G&D :** Any other recent additions that you're excited about? 

**YL :** GoDaddy (NYSE: GDDY) is a really fun one. This is another subscription, high-recurring revenue business. And it has a dominant position in their market – it has about ~23% of all domain registrations and roughly half of new domain registrations in the U.S. Its competitive advantage comes from its name recognition and superior organic search ranking, which gives GoDaddy the lowest customer acquisition cost in the industry. 

The industry doesn't really compete on price when it comes to domain registration, since it's a fraction of the cost of running a business. While domain registration is a lower margin business, it's an extremely important on-ramp that allows GoDaddy to upsell and cross-sell higher margin products. Once GoDaddy has its foot in the door with a small-medium business (“SMB”), it then sells services such as website content management software, hosting services, productivity tools and telephony. GoDaddy has world-class customer care that is extremely good at managing customer relationships and upselling products that actually help customers succeed. GoDaddy's so good at this that its customer care team is actually a profit center, not a cost center. 

We think GoDaddy has tremendous secular tailwinds behind it. The internet and the need for businesses to have an online presence is growing robustly domestically and internationally. GoDaddy operates in both jurisdictions and its opportunity to continue to expand internationally is enormous. There are about 500 million independent SMBs in the world. GoDaddy has only 18.5 million customer relationships today, meaning there's a huge opportunity to grow the number of customers it serves. On top of that, its customers are only spending $150 per year at the moment with GoDaddy, so there is also opportunity for further penetration with existing customers. 

GoDaddy is led by one of the most capable management teams we've seen. Scott Wagner, who is the former CEO of KKR Capstone, decided to leave KKR to run GoDaddy. He recruited top notch talent and brought several members of his KKR team over with him, which makes the management team bench very deep. Scott also owns over $130 million of stock, so he's well aligned with shareholders. We think Scott is a fantastic allocator of capital and that the stock has a reasonable valuation. It is currently trading at 20x current FCF. We see this company compounding free cash flow per share comfortably in the 20s for many years to come.


**G&D :** We noticed that you recently added Fox. What are your thoughts on linear vs. OTT content creators vs. pure distributors, and how do you see that landscape unfolding?

**YL :** Charter Communications (NASDAQ: CHTR) is one of our oldest and largest holdings. The beautiful part about Charter is that it's content agnostic. Charter is a pipe – the most valuable, hard to replicate, fastest pipe – into the house. It's a great asset. We think it should grow free cash flow per share at 30% for years. 

Content is at an interesting juncture. Content is both niche and scale; Fox is niche and Netflix is scale. I think content is completely shifting to one of those extremes, with nothing in between. Netflix is currently spending $13 billion a year on content. Practically no one else can spend at that level, with maybe Disney and Amazon being the exception. But it's a really expensive game to take on.

The other option is to go in the exact opposite direction. Fox has must-watch TV: Fox News is its most important property with its broadcast network being number two. This is the whole reason why Rupert Murdoch sold most of Fox's assets to Disney. By the way, not many business titans build and break up their empires in their lifetime. I have to tell you, a sell decision at that scale is truly amazing. That takes extraordinary discipline. But Rupert clearly saw how the strategic context was unfolding. 

You have to be one or the other, scale or niche, and if you're neither you're dead, so he repositioned his company. The Fox broadcast network pivoted from general entertainment to mostly live sports, and Fox News continues to be one of the most important channels in any cable bundle. Both are absolute must-watch live TV. They're at risk of linear subscriber decline, sure, but these are among the last men standing and they have tremendous pricing power.


**G&D :** With training and learning being such an integral part of Aravt´'s investment philosophy, are there any key insights you've learned by studying excellent managers? 

**YL :** Of course. We are students of excellence in general. There's just an energy that gets released by studying excellence. That's why people are so in awe of sports – you are literally viewing excellence at pinnacle moments. You get to see excellence clash. That is incredible stuff.

One of the reasons I love investment management so much is that I'm literally getting paid to study business excellence. Two of the best business managers in the world today are Nicnstk Howley at [[TransDigm]] (NYSE: TDG), an aerospace company, and [[Mark Leonard]] at [[Constellation Software]], a vertical market software company. These companies are both [[serial acquirers]], and these CEOs are both outstanding capital allocators. [[TransDigm]] has compounded at 30% for 12 years and Constellation has compounded at almost 40% for 12 years. 

We studied them and their businesses to try answering two simple questions: How can an external capital allocator sustain such extreme performance, and can it be replicated into an investment firm? The first and most important decision they made was with their game selection. They chose an excellent market. That's why it was so important to us when we created Aravt that we’re specific on where we spend our time.

Mark chose vertical market software, which is characterized by highly repetitive, subscription-based businesses with low churn, high barriers to entry, small niches, and tons of companies. He found a vein of high-quality businesses and had deep insights on how to run them better. 

For Nick, it wasn't necessarily aerospace in general. His insight was specifically that aftermarket proprietary aerospace components, although not subscription in nature, are subscription-like. The barriers to entry there are extremely high, so niches are created and driven by FAA regulations. For a substantial part of [[TransDigm]]'s aftermarket business, there literally is no second-source provider. As the life of a plane or of a platform is 20 to 50 years, that’s how long [[TransDigm]] ends up providing the parts - and on a regular basis too, through normal wear-and-tear and regulatory upgrades. It creates subscription-type characteristics in an industry that's grown revenue seat miles at 5.5% per annum for 30 years.

With game selection, not only did they start in fantastic industries, but they’re very clear on what they look for in their acquisitions. Constellation has done 400 deals and [[TransDigm]] has done 65. To our knowledge, they have a near zero loss ratio. How is that even possible in situations of external capital allocation? It´'s because they're very disciplined with what they look for, how they underwrite and how they implement positive change. We obviously think [[TransDigm]] and Constellation are fantastic businesses. We've owned both for five years and they're both still top-five positions for us. In addition to that, we've tried to weave a lot of what Mark and Nick do into different parts of our own firm's culture and portfolio design.

**G&D :** You mentioned earlier that time allocation is very important for your firm. Could you talk more about that, as well as about your own personal time allocation? 

**YL :** We have a cadence to our organization; I believe all organizations should have a cadence. It operates more smoothly that way and requires less tactical decisions. We have an accountability meeting at 8:30 every Monday morning where we review the week back and the week forward for every team member. If there's a position that´'s being pitched, either for our inventory or our live portfolio, then it's a two-hour meeting on Thursday that we keep blocked as a placeholder in the team's calendar. The first Monday of every month is an entire portfolio review, long and short. When we meet, we're purposeful about agendas and we always start on time. 

Separately, we have dedicated, concentrated time for training – whether it's process, case studies or something else. We usually have two retreats a year, with one R&D dive during one of the two retreats. We do ongoing training all the time for process. The process training for all of last year was on primary research. We brought in investigative journalists and trained our team on outreach, email formation, how they should attend trade conferences and how they should interact with management teams and primary sources… we spent the whole year training on it. High performance requires breaking processes down to their core elements and rebuilding them to improve execution. We do this all the time with our processes. 

My own time is a blend of proactive and reactive. Generally speaking, I don't take any meetings or calls in the morning. I think if you can be highly focused, creative and engaged for three solid hours a day, then you're going to do very well in life. My highest quality time is between roughly 7:00 in the morning and 2:00 in the afternoon, so I protect that time at all costs. We don't trade day-of, so I don'´t really have to fixate on news flow first thing in the morning. I journal in the mornings, and I pick one or two substantive pieces of work that I need to get done and I spend my mornings doing them.


**G&D :** You seem to be the type of person who would think about shaping the granular details of your environment for maximum output. What are some of the things you found to be disproportionately effective in controlling your environment? 

**YL :** First thing, you need to manage your email and all of your devices. Get your smartphones out of your office. Turn off the screens blinking at you. Regiment how often you touch email. That´'s a huge one because it's unbelievably disruptive to your concentration. Texting and IM is even worse. I work in 25- and 45-minute chunks, and then I take breaks. I manage those chunks proactively. 

Some people like open environments, but I personally can't do deep thinking with a lot of noise around me. We're an office culture where doors get closed when required and open when they're not. You want to be on offense, not defense with your space. I have a “do not disturb” sign on my door and I use it. I silenced the ringer on my office phone. Flow state doesn't last for more than two, maybe three hours in a day. Physically, it can't. So you need to have control of your environment and what you let come into it.

**G&D :** Do you have any advice for students interested in investment management? 

**YL :** I have five pieces of advice. **The first and most important one is “ea”, which is the Polynesian word for personal sovereignty.** You have to completely own your journey. Be accountable for your training and your path and don'´t cede that responsibility to anybody. Be proactive and relentlessly invest in your own training. The quality of your lives literally depends on this decision. You have to own it. 

Second, **do a speed-reading course.** We read a lot in this business. Effective reading is a highly learnable skill and it takes less than eight hours to become good at it. It is a huge advantage over time. Besides all of the work-related reading I do daily, I try to read 70-100 books a year. I do not read this much because I was born with any special skill – it was a skill I learned 25 years ago and I make time to use it. 

My third piece of advice is to **do case studies.** Deeply study the best and worst investments in history. Even better, do it with a bunch of friends. Learn in clusters. This business is about pattern recognition. The more cases you do, the more you can create conviction around pattern recognition. This is how you learn in dog years. You need to be deeply prepared for luck to be successful.

Fourth, **be prepared for the emotional side of this game.** I don't think anyone can fully express to you how emotionally demanding this business can be at times, and if you are not emotionally aligned for the game, it can be very painful. It's the best business in the world for those who are curious and emotionally resilient. There are lots of ways to make money, but it is really important to find one that fits well with the way that you are built emotionally. You have to discover it as early as you can. Markets are a very expensive place to find out who you are. I think authenticity and self-awareness are absolutely crucial for success and the more time you are introspective about what drives your emotions, the stronger you will be. I don't think this is something you can work out in school. It is something you just have to come to the business to learn. 

**Finally, do not fear your mistakes**. When you enter this industry, you will fail more often and with fiercer intensity than you ever have before. Do your best to fall forward. Learn and move on. Most of what I have shared with you today was learned from mistakes I have made (and I have made a lot of them). Just do not let them stop you. Having said that, I think investing is the best business in the world. You're getting paid to learn. I literally think it is Disneyland for curious and competitive adults. It's a true privilege to be in it. Come in with your eyes wide open, but have fun once you've selected your game appropriately. 

**G&D :** Thank you so much for your time.
