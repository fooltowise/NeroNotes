Mergers and acquisitions are often viewed with some reservation among public shareholders. After all, most acquisitions [fail to create value](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/where-mergers-go-wrong) for the buying shareholders, especially on a per-share basis. On hindsight, the prices paid and the synergies calculated seldom make any sense, and thus only the acquired company plus the bankers, stand to gain. These base rates related to M&A, are also deeply ingrained in most finance alumni sifting the world for investment ideas. Perhaps this could represent some type of opportunity?

What if you could partner with a group of world-class capital allocators, sticking to a proven M&A playbook in private markets and sidecar their compounding trajectory of high-return investments? Private equity? No, these are publicly listed companies with permanent capital, liquidity, diversification and zero fees.

What I’m referring to, more specifically, are high-performing conglomerates, possessing investing superpowers at the helm, decentralized and operating in fragmented end-markets, allowing for organic and inorganic growth via **multiple small private investments**. These are diversified and self-funded entities, hence acquisitive growth is more akin to organic growth, and not reliant on capital markets. To be clear, we are not dealing with roll-ups or turnarounds and certainly not “transformative” acquisitions in public markets with integrations and lofty synergy targets.

These companies are capital allocation vehicles at its core, targeting smaller-sized private businesses with a data-driven acquisition process, providing a reinvestment engine where often organic reinvestment opportunities are lacking. In essence, they are bridging the gap between the capital allocation layer at the top, while releasing entrepreneurial spirit and autonomy throughout the group, adding diversity, resilience, and scale, derisking the overall base.

The programmatic approach mentioned is key. I first stumbled on a McKinsey report in Demesne Investment’s article “Practice Makes Perfect”. According to their report on [How lots of small M&A deals add up to big value](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/repeat-performance-the-continuing-case-for-programmatic-m-and-a): between 2007 and 2017, the programmatic acquirers in a data set of 1,000 global companies achieved higher excess total shareholder returns than did industry peers using other M&A strategies (large deals, selective acquisitions, or organic growth). The study also highlights the importance of building up organizational infrastructures and establishing best practices across _all_ stages of the M&A process—from strategy and sourcing to due diligence and integration planning to establishing the operating model.

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F262d3665-2824-49a5-b84b-3df8d7302a38_859x514.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F262d3665-2824-49a5-b84b-3df8d7302a38_859x514.png)

The main takeaway from the McKinsey study highlights the importance of practice and frequency:

> By building a dedicated M&A function, codifying learnings from past deals, and taking an end-to-end perspective on transactions, businesses can emulate the success of programmatic acquirers—becoming as capable in M&A as they are in sales, R&D, and other disciplines that create outperformance relative to competitors.

It follows, then, that the base rates on M&A are mostly anchored on large-deal public M&A, and not the special group of programmatic acquirers chasing multiple small private investments. The frequency of smaller deals across verticals with similar themes, builds repetition, competency, and shared best-practices within the group. This allows for better M&A-processes not only on the HQ-level, but also throughout the group with more people responsible for M&A, scaling deal volume. Shared best-practices on working-capital, pricing and numerous other things, help generate organic uplift, an important contributor to overall IRR.

Again, great programmatic acquirers are laser-focused on scaling deal volume and steer clear of increasing deal size to avoid the diminish returns to M&A, after all, deploying large amounts of capital at high returns becomes increasingly hard and bigger moaty businesses invite more competition and higher prices, lowering incremental returns. Bigger transactions, even when ignoring turnarounds and integration, also add more risk. Hence, a growing decentralized organization without decentralizing the M&A responsibility, will eventually face diminishing returns as they age, pointed out by Canuck Analysts in “[Studying Serial Acquirers](https://exploringcontext.substack.com/p/studying-serial-acquirers)” where they did some excellent benchmarking proving their point:

> As a) average deal sizes grow and b) the amount of annual cash flow that must be reinvested grows, incremental returns on capital decline.
> 
> The biggest roadblock to defying the law of diminishing returns to M&A is that most serial acquirers, particularly platforms and accumulators, do not sufficiently scale the human capital involved in M&A and the structures and processes guiding them – as they get larger.  Inevitably, this lack of investment in human capital creates a bottleneck, leading them to scale by doing larger deals to move the needle rather than doing more deals. - [Canuck Analysts](https://exploringcontext.substack.com/p/studying-serial-acquirers)

Speaking of smaller deal sizes, [[Constellation Software]], a VMS-specialist acquirer at $32 billion market cap and ~$5.5 billion of consolidated sales, [is still targeting smaller companies](https://twitter.com/LCinvesting/status/1544309988063150083), even after ~700 transactions since 2015 with median acquisition size of $2.8 million. [[Constellation Software]] is organized through 6 operating groups (which do their own acquiring), diversified across 100+ different verticals and 1000+ underlying business units running autonomously. Furthermore, each of the six operating groups service specific verticals like agri, education, healthcare, real estate, construction and hospitality. More importantly, even the underlying business units/companies are incentivised to do deals up to certain thresholds without approval from the HQ, chasing even more smaller deals at low prices.

Keep in mind that most smaller private deals should warrant a hefty size/illiquidity discount compared to click-and-buy public markets, after all, these are smaller-sized businesses often dependent on a few individuals and a limited number of customers and suppliers. Importantly for us however, these are deals at sales thresholds which are more immune from interest by search funds and private equity. This is why there is riches in niches, narrow markets that attract and allow only a small number of [specialists to dominate](https://www.wealthclub.co.uk/articles/charlie-huggins-investing-views/niches-vs-large-markets/), providing sticky products or services that are mission-critical to the end-customer, but a tiny part of the cost they are protecting. The key is finding niched businesses at great prices that are somewhat shielded from the micro and macro volatility that [most small businesses face](https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/68818184/beshore-private-equity-venture-capital-and-the-future-of-money-management?startTime=3982&btp=b657913b).

Case in point vertical market software (VMS), which is deeply tailored for a specific industry in contrast to horizontal software like Microsoft Excel. Deep customization and its mission-critical attributes enable high switching costs (high retention), pricing power, recurring revenue and often negative net working capital. VMS examples include software for traffic control, regulatory software for waste management, booking systems for golf clubs, software tailored for mortgage and real estate lending and dental software (and obviously more). Recurring revenues with high margins and low levels of capital required generate high recurring cash flows. However, a VMS business may not always provide the biggest organic reinvestment opportunities compared to horizontal software, perfect for serial acquirers providing a reinvestment engine, but not so interesting for bigger funds looking for scalable industries. Still, the attraction for great moaty VMS businesses is widely shared, but the market is growing all the time, with a VMS-company like [[Constellation Software]] having over 40,000 opportunities in their database and growing.

Niching down and focusing on market leaders create fertile ground for stable cashflows (albeit at higher prices compared to turnarounds), which organically funds more acquisitions at lower financial risk, often targeting constant net-debt-to-EBIDTA ratios and low-risk deal structures. A side note on the importance of being self-funded, David Barber, co-founder and the retired CEO of another [[Halma]], another great serial acquirer, once said that internally funded acquisitions are more akin to organic growth in contrast to those deals funded by share issues, which is an interesting statement (h/t [Chris Mayer](https://www.woodlockhousefamilycapital.com/post/how-they-did-it-a-uk-100-bagger)):

> I would suggest that the first distinction to draw is between acquisitions which are funded by internally generated surplus cash and those which are funded by share issues. As l said earlier, in [[Halma]], because of our high rate of return on capital, we have been able to fund almost all our acquisitions from surplus cash....the first distinction l would draw is that growth by internally funded cash is more akin to organic growth than it is to growth by acquisition. - David Barber ([Delivering Shareholder Value, 1997](https://www.halma.com/~/media/Files/H/Halma/Corp/documents/david-barber-halma-strategy-speech.pdf))

A decentralized structure prioritizing stable cashflows right from the start, allow for more management resources spent on acquisitions and not on micromanagement and integration. All these ingredients must be in place for successfully scaling the M&A machinery without friction. Easy in theory, very difficult in practice. Decentralization can also enable a bundle of other great qualities, [from a podcast](https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/53165581/huggins-diploma-specialized-distribution?tab=transcript) with Charlie Huggins on serial acquirer Diploma:

> Decentralization works really well when it's done right, because you retain the agility, autonomy, entrepreneurialism, as you grow in size. That's one of the great challenges for businesses is when they scale, they lose what it is that made them successful in the first place. I think Charlie Munger says bureaucracy is like cancer, avoid it like the plague. Most businesses get more bureaucratic as they get bigger, and they become vulnerable. Decentralized businesses tend not to because each company within the group is independent. They can scale themselves. The overall business can scale without these smaller businesses becoming that much bigger. So it just makes it easier to scale.

Cultivating a highly entrepreneurial culture in a decentralized structure combined with investing superpowers, is rare but extremely powerful. This way, conglomerate discounts can be turned into conglomerate premiums as long as you have simple profit goals, decentralization and provide employees with trust, as noted by Gustaf Håkansson at [Acquirers.com](https://www.acquirers.com/post/conglomerate-discounts-decentralisation-roper-and-jan-wallander) after [interviewing Fredrik Karlsson](https://www.acquirers.com/post/roko-the-perpetual-owner) from [[Röko]] (and prior CEO of [[Lifco]] for 20 years). I liked the way the author framed this:

> Entrepreneurial drive coupled with a rational and tax-efficient internal capital market can warrant a conglomerate premium.

I think there is a lot more that could be said in terms of great decentralized systems, and I particularly find [trust based business models](https://reqcapital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Trust-based-business-models.pdf) to be mostly ignored and underdiscussed by market participants. Why is that? Perhaps because the cumulative effects are only visible on longer time frames?

There are already great taxonomy frameworks out there from REQ Capital, Demesne Investments and Ryan Krafft. To keep it simple, I find it helpful to split acquirers into **specialists and generalists**. Specialists are comprised of roll-ups with a high degree of integration, rolling up a single vertical, often chasing synergies. Names that come to mind are United Rentals, Dentalcorp and Norva24. The second type of specialists are theme-based specialists like Diploma, [[Constellation Software]] or [[Addtech]], often honing in on specific niches or themes across multiple verticals, compounding domain knowledge like a rollup, but still flexible and opportunistic within their universe. Moreover, synergies are not forced but often welcome.

Generalists on the other hand may often appear to be focusing on specific niches, but in practice they pretty much buy everything, either in a decentralized structure ([[Lagercrantz]], [[Lifco]], Roper) or more centralized. Just to flesh out this a little bit more, a generalist acquirer like [[Lifco]] has three segments, one of them is called “system solutions” where they put almost anything which does not belong in the other two boxes (dental and demolition & tools), and similarly with [[Lagercrantz]] and their “international” segment which serves the same purpose. The name of the segment becomes a residual of the investment, keeping maximum flexibility as they perpetually learn and move from one domain to a new one. Obviously, they come in many shapes and colors, but this is the scaling approach for generalists I find most compelling. In my opinion, generalists and theme-based specialists, doing it right, resemble a great flexible IRR-focused investor and provide the biggest diversification and scaling opportunity for investors. The degree of centralization varies within the groups, but I prefer the decentralized model including decentralizing the M&A responsibility throughout the organization (not only decentralizing leads generation). Easier said than done, but a key differentiator in terms of scaling (Lagerkrantz and [[Lifco]] are working on it, but not fully there yet).

There are also other reasons why I find generalists and theme-based specialists more attractive, and that is because roll-ups focusing on integration are often in a hurry chasing deals, with very specific short-term goals around future acquired sales and synergies often without considering return on capital. While a [[Lifco]] or a Vitec often source their own deals (avoiding broker-led auctions), waiting opportunistically just like a great investor would, roll-ups are often busy trying to meet sales guidance which incorporates future deals. The urgency might be real, after all, rolling up single vertical means TAM is limited and new competition from PE might be imminent. However, the urgency and short-termism create complexity and poor incentives and sometimes bad performance for shareholders. It\`s a shift in mindset and the strategy for most roll-ups doesn’t lend itself to great investing. Obviously there are lots of exceptions and claiming roll-ups are bad is the same as saying all M&A is bad, but I recall an [interesting discussion by Brent Beshore](https://www.joincolossus.com/episodes/77276674/beshore-what-you-learn-about-business?startTime=864&btp=ff90cb8e) on horizontal vs. vertical rollup strategies, documenting the weird psychology that underlies these processes.

As investors we are automatically drawn to fast-growing companies without considering the force multiplier of compounding which is time. We have a propensity to seek the obscure instead of the obvious, which means over-weighing the recent vivid evidence. Typical examples are ephemeral stuff like optical cheapness and quarterly EPS, while corporate attributes like longevity and durability always lose against our perceptual gravitation towards novelty.

On the surface, some acquirers may be perceived as relative dull companies with boring organic growth prospects, but their ability to scale and reinvest a high portion of earnings year after year at good returns can lead to non-linear outcomes. Most of us are repeatedly surprised when we look at reverse DCFs for high-performance acquirers and realize we could have paid a very high start-multiple historically and still receive a great market return. The mathematically explanation, however, is first and foremost derived from the durability of returns and the time exponent.

> Compounding is just returns to the power of time. Time is the exponent that does the heavy lifting, and the common denominator of almost all big fortunes isn’t returns; it’s endurance and longevity. “Excellent returns for a few years” is not nearly as powerful as “pretty good returns for a long time.” And few things can beat, “average returns sustained for a very long time.” - Morgan Housel

So, to fully achieve compounding magic, one must first arrive at the “second half of the chessboard”, a phrase coined by Ray Kurzweil in reference to the point where an exponentially growing factor begins to have a significant economic impact. To arrive there however, means minimizing interruption and not blowing up in the meantime, both at the business and investor level. After all, if you keep running the clock on a low-probability event, it\`s bound to happen. This applies not only to nuclear events, but also to business-model risk. This is the reason why the best acquirers should not only be celebrated for their compounding superpowers, but also **equally applauded for becoming more internally diversified, adding resilience, adaptability and scale, derisking the enterprise**.

These ingredients combined increase the odds of arriving at the second half of the chessboard, where compounding essentially gobbles up everything. And as we know, stock prices eventually mirror intrinsic value growth.

A helpful mental model when it comes to diversified and self-funded acquirers, is thinking in terms of the root systems of plants and trees (h/t to [LibertyRPF](https://www.libertyrpf.com/p/22-my-thoughts-on-internal-diversification)). Some companies may have a single but shallow root, represented by a single product sold to a single customer in a single end-market. A fragile three-legged stool in most scenarios!

Alternatively, one could own a decentralized holdco with great capital allocators at the top, releasing entrepreneurial spirit at the business level across multiple end-markets, both in terms of verticals and geographies, smoothing out cyclicality. What we\`re looking for is a root system sprawling in all directions and over great distances; they are a lot harder to pull out and may survive better even if large sections are cut off.

**This is the best of two worlds: a long compounding trajectory and simultaneously lower idiosyncratic risk, hence a growing tree with an increasingly sprawling root system.**

After spending time on high-performing conglomerates, you realize how naive we are as shareholders in individual companies, underwriting single-exposure risk like product concentration, customer concentration risk, key personnel risk, regulatory risk, financial risk, excessive cyclicality or relying on a single end-market. In the fullness of time, any of these risks will play out eventually. However, isn’t that what portfolio construction is meant for? Size accordingly. With this internal diversification (including decentralization of the M&A responsibility itself), owning fewer than five serial acquirers could mean that you\`re actually more diversified compared to a portfolio comprised of more than 5 single-exposure companies. [This framework](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/547a4cdae4b09b5c2136d9b2/t/55a7ef8ae4b003faa1bc57f0/1437069194813/Complexity+Investing+v9.1.4.pdf) on optimizing resilience and optionality, laid out by NZS Capital, might be relevant in this context.

In terms of examples, look no further than the organization chart of [[Constellation Software]] which perfectly illustrates a sprawling root system (6 operating groups across 100+ verticals and 1000+ underlying businesses including Topicus which is spun off, click on image for zoom).

[![[[Constellation Software]] January 2022](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc921274a-9add-498c-b4f4-f292bb77bc8f_1000x1000.png "[[Constellation Software]] January 2022")](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wl80yKcW_0LRToVk5m_DhHqR5XqOpY-k/view)

And similarly, with [[Lifco]], one of the great generalist acquirers from Sweden with around 180+ underlying companies across multiple niches and geographies (h/t REQ Capital):

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68294f13-258c-40e4-aafc-6e3b0aa4f6db_1586x1016.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F68294f13-258c-40e4-aafc-6e3b0aa4f6db_1586x1016.png)

I also find generalists and theme-based specialists that have successfully expanded their M&A capabilities globally over many years to be in a better position, building repetition and datasets, resulting in additional derisking and TAM-growth. Case in point, a Nordic generalist like [[Lifco]] or [[Lagercrantz]] might have considerable more scaling opportunities, and lower risk, compared to Nordic peers which are often constrained within specific countries in the region. Building up these capabilities, spanning multiple borders and cultures, take time and a skill, and is hard to pull of in a decentralized machine.

Speaking of repetition and datasets, the following summary from [MBI Deep Dive](https://mbi-deepdives.com/login/?mepr-unauth-page=1857&redirect_to=%2Fcsu%2F) gives a good summary of the data-driven acquisition process and diligence present at [[Constellation Software]]:

> The board and/or headquarter (HQ) recommends and sets hurdle rates for acquisition -> HQ creates a threshold for acquisition for OGs (operating groups) for which they won’t be required to ask for approval from HQ/board (similarly, the OGs can have similar threshold for BU managers (BU = business units)-> the M&A/business development team or the deal sourcing manager calculates potential IRR for the deal and creates bull/base/bear case scenarios for each acquisition to see where exactly their base case scenarios fall in distribution based on historical acquisition track record (is it 55th percentile or 95th percentile; the manager better has VERY high confidence if their projections appear to be 95th percentile)-> one year after the acquisition, there is Post Acquisition Review (PAR) in which the manager/team discusses the initial projections and actual result as well as the lessons from the experience-> BUs try to use cash to acquire more companies and if they don’t see much opportunity, they can repatriate cash to HQ. But if a BU consistently generates high IRR and wants to repatriate money to HQ, HQ may ask the BU to “Keep Your Capital” (KYC) so that BUs are more incentivized for deploying capital at lower IRRs (but higher than hurdle rates). On the other hand, if an acquisition does poorly, it remains in your capital base while calculating your ROIC. You cannot “adjust” your capital for impairment later which also acts as an incentive to allocate capital prudently.

Sidecar investing was first introduced to me by Richard J. Zeckhauser in his paper “Investing in the Unknown and Unknowable.” The analogy can be described as follows:

> The investor rides along in a sidecar pulled by a powerful motorcycle. The more the investor is distinctively positioned to have confidence in the driver’s integrity and his motorcycle’s capabilities, the more attractive the investment.

Sidecar investing essentially means you\`re placing your bet on the management, who themselves are great investors, and you are holding on for the ride – hence the sidecar! In other words, a rare species that combines the best of both worlds: management teams that are excellent operators as well as fantastic investors.  

There’s also a big element of trust involved – after all, you\`re sitting in a sidecar, remember? Trust and culture are one of those intangibles which can\`t be neatly siloed or excel-ranked. However, you should not bet on a single jockey, hoping he or she will never leave the company. What you should look for is a company with an everlasting and celebrated culture around value creation (yes, easier said than done).

Notice that there\`s something deeper going on here, it’s a virtuous cycle; the management is doing the work for you and you are piggybacking their ability to compound capital and to adapt to changes in the environment. This frees up time for you as an investor where you don’t need to find new investment ideas every month, which further increases focus and the quality of your ideas.

But don’t we always as minority shareholders invest in public companies and ride along in a sidecar, trusting management to be both good operators and great investors? If you are managing other people’s money, you probably have limited partners who have underwritten your ability to compound their capital, so why is this any different? Which also begs the question:

> If a minority of investors can beat the market by investing intelligently, why can’t a minority of managers create value by acquiring intelligently? – Pat Dorsey

In fact, parts of the investing community may have issues with sidecar investing. After all, what are portfolio managers paid for? Media headlines some time ago on funds charging fees for all-in positions in Berkshire Hathaway comes to mind. Perhaps there is some merit to this, but investors should remember that their scorecard is not computed using Olympic-diving methods: degree-of-difficulty does not count (as the saying goes). Besides the analytical framework for sourcing and identifying these companies, let us not forget that what matters is the destination, hence staying the course and reaping the full benefits of business compounding.

Some may look at acquirers from a surface level and attribute historical performance solely in terms of multiple arbitrage. Buy companies at low multiples, integrate successfully, and the market will apply the acquirer’s multiple to a bigger base of earnings. This is only partly explaining the story though. Smaller private deals should rightfully be discounted compared to a public company offering scale, diversification and liquidity. Moreover, the inverse of the multiple paid can also be used to arrive at the return on incremental capital, without considering organic uplift. So, I think the multiple arbitrage argument deserves more context in a universe of IRR-focused capital allocators.

Additionally, it is worth pondering over why the sidecar opportunity in serial acquirers “exists” and what variant perceptions this area represents. Skilled capital allocation (or investing) could be described as having the following attributes:

-   A focus on the end destination, not the path.
    
-   Unpredictable - hard for the sell-side to model (although certainly more sell-siders try!)
    
-   Unconventional - Creating value via acquisitions when most companies destroy value
    
-   Lumpy - Value creation is financially messy and comes in spurts rather than a smooth line.
    

A big source of variant perception is represented by the fact that growth for these companies is a function of “ebb and flow”. Some of it is organic and some inorganic, with the latter being highly unpredictable, both in timing and in size. In other words, this group of companies do not lend itself particularly well to the agenda of the sell-side, trying to pinpoint a 12-month price target. Keep in mind that these companies, for the most part, don\`t provide any guidance (and rightly so), and the great one’s don\`t raise equity (self-funded).

Investors new to serial acquirers, looking for optical cheapness, with a gravitational pull towards “valuation” heuristics like <10x next year’s earnings = cheap, 10-15x = ok, and >15x = expensive, may easily ignore this segment of the market. It’s easy, but also perhaps intellectually lazy, to assume that you are “late to the party”, but multiples can sometimes mislead and the biggest job is figuring out how much capital can be reinvested at what returns for how long. Too often, though, the “how long” part tends to receive the least amount of attention, even though intrinsic value grows exponentially with time when return hurdles are met.

As per Mark Leonard from [[Constellation Software]]:

> A very special case of value investing, is the example of a company that is growing quickly, that the market expects to stop growing within the next 5-7 years, but that actually keeps growing quickly for much longer. If you can spot one of those, it may appear expensive on a P/E basis, but may actually be an attractive long-term investment on a “value investing” basis. Spotting this kind of investment requires the ability to foretell the distant future…which is extremely difficult to do with consistency

It’s worth pointing out that as sidecars investors, we\`re participating on a different time scale. Welcome to the business time scale where value creation comes in spurts rather than a smooth line and where the path to riches doesn’t correlate perfectly with the incentives of the marginal price setter.

Case in point from Swedish [[Lifco]] (a generalist acquirer): how can you intelligently incorporate these lumpy acquisitions in a DCF-model? For the record, ROIC has averaged >20% including goodwill.

This is the outskirt of the time spectrum, where earnings guidance is futile and where the end destination is what matter, not the path. However, you should still be keenly aware of any data points signaling the degree of management execution, culture drift, and the quality of the compounding trajectory. Stay in the sidecar (but don\`t fall asleep!)

The playbook for most finance alumni is to think everything in finance has mean-reverting attributes. Heck, the original framework for value investing was partly based on mean-reversion. Why should one expect, as a default, that a company with a reinforcing culture around business building and positively skewed capital allocation will mean-revert in terminal year 5? Why not focus on the exception from the rule?

If you can identify the minority of managers highly skilled at capital allocation, you should probably apply a different lens to the compounding trajectory. This is where creativity, trust and underwriting the unknown and unknowable come into full play, perhaps 4 words shunned or scuffed at in certain value circles, but bear with me. We are entering a domain where intuitive thinking and deeply ingrained mental models need to be questioned, paused, or abandoned. This time you need to put yourself in a position to reap the full benefits of long-term value creation.

Another benefit of being a sidecar investor is that you can finally thrive in market drawdowns, despite running a fully invested portfolio but where the underlying companies have some flexibility at hand. Lower prices could mean more optionality, hence more opportunities for intrinsic value growth. This could take the form of market share growing organically or via compelling acquisitions or perhaps share repurchases at attractive prices. If you zoom out, it is mind-boggling to witness how much intrinsic value growth can be generated by exceptional people, compounding good decisions, over long stretches of time.

> The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is now. - Chinese proverb

I think there is a tendency in the value-investing community to overdose on the usual suspects from the book, “The Outsiders” by William Thorndike. That covers Berkshire Hathaway, [[Constellation Software]], Fairfax, Teledyne, TCI, et.al. Fantastic capital allocators, but we can all agree the best would be to track every successful company ahead of time when the companies were small. Realistically, however, there is a trade-off between track record and both the size and the length of the growth runway. What ultimately matters, from a now perspective, is the future, and how much capital these companies can deploy, at what rates, and for how long.

In terms of acquirers specifically, it’s also worth highlighting the 20-year tailwind of low-interest rates has to some degree lifted all boats relying on external financing to fund their acquisitions. Interest rates and multiples are also linked. In other words, the future may not duplicate the past for some of these companies.

Let’s buckle up!
