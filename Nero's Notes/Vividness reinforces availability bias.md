# Vividness reinforces availability bias

[[Availability Bias]] is reinforced when the events remembered are more vivid.

Examples:
- Road safety announcement are usually not working, unless they use very graphic footage
- 9/11 made people avoid taking flights for a long time, increasing road accidents
- The probability of a physician smoking is directly related to the distance of his specialty from the lungs
- Before boarding a flight people are willing to pay more for a insurance policy covering "terrorist attacks" than for a policy covering all risks
- "When I am not near the girl I love, I love the girl I'm near."
- Purchase of earthquake insurance increases greatly after the occurrence of an earthquake and declines steadily as the memory of the event fades.
- Similar behavior has been observed for floods and food insurance.
- **News are particularly prone to trigger vividness and availability bias in yourself**. See [[Avoid News]]
