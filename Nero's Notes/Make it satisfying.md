- The 4th Law of Behavior Change is _Make it Satisfying_
- We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying
- The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards
- The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: _What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided._
- To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful - even if it is in a small way.
- The first three laws of behavior change - _make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy_ - increase your odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change - make it satisfying - increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time.

- One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress
- A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit - like marking an X on a calendar
- Habits trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress. 
- Don't break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive.
- Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible.
- Just because you can measure something doesn't mean it's the most important thing.

- The inversion of the 4th law of behavior change is _make it unsatisfying_
- We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying.
- An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us.
- A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful.
- Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator.
