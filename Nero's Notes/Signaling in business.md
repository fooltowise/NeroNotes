# Signaling in Business

Look at the following things:
  - posh rope-handled carrier bags you get when you spend an appreciable amount of money on clothes or cosmetics
  - the free extra scoop of fries they give you at five guys
  - the fortune spent on a wedding
  - your modest minibar charges that are waved by a hotel
  - that fancy training course your company sent you on
  - a lavish advertising campaign
  - investment in a brand
  - a free glass of limoncello given to you by a restaurant after your meal

All these things only make sense if we assume that some [[Signaling]]  is going on - they are examples of a behavior which is costly in the short term and will only pay off, if at all, in the long term. They are thus - if nothing else - reliable signals that the person or business engaging in that behavior is acting on the basis of long term self interest rather than short term expediency.

It is widely known in the training community that the biggest gain from a company's investment in training comes in the form of staff loyalty.

Bits deliver information, but costliness carries meaning and [[We value meaning]]. We do not invite people to our weddings by sending out an email. We put the information on a gilt embossed card, which costs a fortune.
