##### Inflating sales growth at the core business

- Look for strange definitions of organic or pro forma sales growth
- Scrutinize the organic growth calculation of acquisitive companies, as it may include revenue that spilled over from the target company.
- Raise your antennae when key metrics include acquired revenue streams
- Look out for acquisitions of companies with competing products
- Be skeptical when gaap earnings materially lag adjusted metrics.
