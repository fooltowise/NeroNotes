Because of [[self deception]], we don't always know the whys behind our own behavior. But we certainly pretend to know.

Experiences with split-brained patients show how the left hemisphere of the brain, lacking the reason to give for a behavior, *will make up one on the spot.*

Rationalization, also called *confabulation*, is the production of fabricated stories made up without any conscious intention to deceive.  See [[Reason as rationalization]] 

Michael Gazzaniga concluded from his research that all human brains contain a system he calls the "interpreter module". The job of this module is to make sense of our experiences by constructing explanations: stories that integrate information about the past and present, and about oneself and the outside world.

If you want to see rationalization in action, just watch the press secretary of a president or prime minister take questions from reporters. As a result the interpreter module might as well be called the "Press Secretary". [[Consciousness is the PR office]]

There's a very real sense in which *we* are the Press Secretaries within our minds. In other words, the parts of the mind we identify with, the parts we think of as our conscious selves ("I", "myself", "my conscious ego") are the ones responsible for strategically spinning the truth for an external audience.

You are not the king in your brain. You are the creepy guy standing next to the king going "A most judicious choice, sire..."

We pretend we are in charge, both to others and even to ourselves, but we are less in charge than we think. We pose as priviledged insiders, when in fact we're often making the same kind of educated guesses that any informed outsider could make.

The upshot is that every tie we give a reason, there's a risk we're just making things up.
