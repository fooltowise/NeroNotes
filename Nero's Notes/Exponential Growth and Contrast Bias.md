Exponential growth is deceptive. It starts out almost imperceptibly and then explodes with unexpected fury. Unexpected, that is, if one does not care to follow its trajectory. 

Any technology that becomes digitized enters a period of deceptive growth. During the early period of exponentials, the doubling of small numbers (0.001, 0.002, 0.004, 0.008) all basically look like zero. But once it hits the knee of the curve, you are only ten doublings away from 1'000X, 20 doublings away from 1'000'000X, and thirty doubling away from 1'000'000'000X.
