### Still lost on where to start...

## Where Do I Start?

### Exercise #1: Just begin writing.

Each day open your Evernote and write 100-300 words. On whatever intrigues you. Do it for 30 days. See what shakes out? What is it that speaks to you? Where do the topics keep overlapping? 

### Exercise #2: Do I Have Enough

Open a page, and list out all the articles you think you could write on your subject. Say it is side hustles... It could be:

-   Side hustles that don't suck
-   Side hustle that turned into a full-time hustle
-   Airbnb Rentals as a side hustle
-   Etsy store as a side hustle that made this person $100k
-   A gardener who turned her love for roses into a brick and mortar side hustle pop up shop
-   Side hustles you can do online
-   Side hustles you can do internationally
-   Nomadic side hustles you've never heard of before
-   Side hustles your boss will never find out about
-   This guy did a side hustle that made him more than being a full-time attorney

That took me 60 seconds to write. Aka - there are a lot of options in this niche. Make sure you obsess on yours enough to have a full library to go to. I do this exercise on a weekly basis.

### And remember this line:

### I am good at what I love. I don’t love all I’m good at.

I scrawl the words on my whiteboard, a daily reminder. "Just because you can, doesn't mean that you should." Stepping back I nod. Yes, today's world is replete with shoulds. I feel them heavy on my shoulders bearing down like weights.

Should say this...

Should do that...

I've never quite understood why for so many the term, live and let live is a personal affront. A red flag waved in the enraged bulls' eyes. When did we become each other's keepers? When did we decide we knew better for another than they knew for themselves?

Want vs should. The life well created is the one that allows more of the former and doesn't mandate more of the latter. The human well evolved is the one who allows for others' wants vs their shoulds.

It's a lesson we'd do well to remember.

Just because you CAN begin a newsletter on something doesn't mean you SHOULD. What lights you up? There's a way to make a business in just about anything.

**Take Action:**

1.  **Evernote -** download it, and start writing daily on things you find interesting. After 30 days go back and look through what those prompts were for you.
