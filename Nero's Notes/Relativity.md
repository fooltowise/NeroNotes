# Relativity

In the physical world, there is subjectivity of perception partly because everything is moving relative to everything else. Back to Einstein's scenario, both the lightning and the train are moving relative to the location of each observer. Our perspective has similar complexity.

What matters is understanding the complexity and value of multiples perspectives. No one sees it all.Multiple perspectives layered together reduce blind spots and offer us a more textured and truer sense of the underlying reality.

Furthermore, we are constantly confounded by the unknown which we must somehow make sense of through the lens of our own experience.

We all get stuck, frustrated when no one seems to understand us, or angry that we aren't making progress based on how we understand the world. This is when it is most helpful to remember relativity and refresh our perspective by stepping outside of ourselves for a little bit.

### The physical principle of relativity
The principle of relativity is one of the basic principles in physics. **It states that the laws of physics should not depend upon the referential that is chosen to express them.**
In particular, one important point goes as follows:
Imagine having a referential S in which the laws of physics apply, and another referential S' moving at a uniform velocity v from S.
Then the laws of physics should apply equally in referential S'. This implies that there is not experiment you can do in S' where the behavior of physical laws would be different from S.

**Therefore, one cannot find an experiment whose design would permit to deduce the velocity of S' compared to S.**
