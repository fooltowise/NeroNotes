In the physical world, there is subjectivity of perception partly because everything is moving relative to everything else. Back to Einstein's scenario, both the lightning and the train are moving relative to the location of each observer. Our perspective has similar complexity.

What matters is understanding the complexity and value of multiples perspectives. No one sees it all.Multiple perspectives layered together reduce blind spots and offer us a more textured and truer sense of the underlying reality.

Furthermore, we are constantly confounded by the unknown which we must somehow make sense of through the lens of our own experience.

We all get stuck, frustrated when no one seems to understand us, or angry that we aren't making progress based on how we understand the world. This is when it is most helpful to remember relativity and refresh our perspective by stepping outside of ourselves for a little bit.
