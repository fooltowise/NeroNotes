People tend to overvalue what belongs to them relative to the value they would place on the same possession if it belonged to someone else. This "endowment" effect helps to explain why most people would demand at least twice as much to sell a ticket to the inaugural ball than they would to buy it. 

A stock does not know that you own it. People who pick their own lottery ticket demand four times the price for selling it than people who are given it randomly. 

We tend to fall in love as well with our own ideas.
