### The AWS of Finance
We all love a good origin story. Steve Jobs assembling kit in his parents’ garage; Mark Zuckerberg coding in his dorm room; Reed Hastings returning his overdue video rental to Blockbuster. These stories help animate the companies they underpin. 

In finance, such stories are, sadly, scarce.

One exception is Blackrock.

In 1986, Larry Fink led the mortgage department at First Boston, a large investment bank, now part of Credit Suisse. He’d joined as a graduate trainee and worked his way up to become tipped as an eventual CEO. But he made a bet that interest rates would rise and they didn’t—they fell, losing the firm $100 million. Fink was pushed out and went on to create Blackrock, today the largest asset management firm in the world.

We’ve talked about Blackrock on the periphery of Net Interest in the past—about its size ($7.32 trillion in assets) and about its dominant position in the field of passive asset management. We haven’t yet gone deep. Which is remiss, because in the narrative we’ve established about the plumbing of markets, Blackrock is a key player. It stands alongside the exchange groups as a major beneficiary of the shift in power away from investment banks. 

### Blackrock
Blackrock’s core business is investment management. Of the $15 billion or so a year the firm makes in revenue, around $12.6 billion comes from investment management. Investment management is a fairly simple business to understand. Blackrock manages money on behalf of others – pension plans, endowments, sovereign wealth funds, central banks, corporations, financial institutions, regular people – for which it takes a small cut, averaging around 0.17% of the assets managed. That cut’s been going down over recent years as a result of competition and a bit of a mix shift, but as long as total assets under management go up, revenues will rise. 

In the investment management business, Blackrock has the benefit of scale. Few other firms can take as low a cut as 0.17% and keep the lights on. Blackrock is able to take that 0.17%, absorb a $10 billion cost base and keep a 38% operating margin for itself. Unless its products go out of favour, its scale sustains a competitive advantage. And its products are not likely to go out of favour because there are so many different types of them (including lots of passive tracking products which are very much in favour 

But Blackrock is more than just an investment management firm. In its filings, the company describes what it does thus:

"BlackRock provides a broad range of investment and technology services to institutional and retail clients worldwide.”

Investment services we’ve discussed, but what’s all this about technology services?

Look closely, and you’ll see another revenue stream at Blackrock, tabbed technology services. It’s smaller – around $1 billion – but it’s growing fast. Its roots lie in the origin story of Blackrock itself.

### Aladdin
Larry Fink is no dumb guy. He didn’t just bet blindly that rates would go up when he was at First Boston. He hedged his bet, so that even if rates went down instead of up, he would be protected. Or at least he thought he would be protected. Stephen Schwarzman explains:

“But a guy from the back office who ran Larry’s computer models had made a mistake, and the hedges were wrong. Larry had made his calculations based on the wrong numbers. In a single quarter, his department lost $100 million. It wasn’t his fault; he didn’t control the back office.”

The episode taught Fink that in future he would need to control the back office.

At Blackrock he developed a risk management system that would be fully integrated with the investment process. He called it Aladdin, short for the less snazzy “Asset, Liability, Debt and Derivative Investment Network”. Aladdin’s job was to provide a comprehensive risk overview of the firm’s portfolios. It became the central system for the firm’s position-keeping, record-keeping and risk control. 

By 1994 Fink’s risk management system was helping him manage around $20 billion of assets. But then the bond market sold off after the Fed began raising interest rates more than the market was expecting. Investors in bond funds, including Fink’s, suffered losses so swift and severe that the period became known as “the bond market massacre”. Blackrock’s funds recovered; by the end of the year its Strategic Global Bond Fund was down only 4.0%. 

Others weren’t so fortunate. According to Rob Goldstein, COO of Blackrock, “People had a lot of mortgage securities that they had bought; that they didn't really have technology to understand what they had bought. We started getting calls from people saying, can you take a look at my portfolio and tell me what you think of it.”

On Halloween 1994 they got one such call from General Electric which was trying to sell its brokerage subsidiary, Kidder Peabody, but was unsure how to value its assets. 

“We were handed a disc. It was a spreadsheet that had like 1000 rows. And it was called Michelle’s spreadsheet… Michelle was someone who worked at Kidder Peabody and as people would do trades… they would sort of shout at Michelle and she would update her spreadsheet.”

The episode made Blackrock realise that it could offer Aladdin’s services out to third parties. On completing the General Electric job (after three all-nighters in a row), the firm went on to license the platform to Freddie Mac and others. By the end of 1998, Blackrock was providing risk analytics services to ten clients, covering more than $400 billion of assets. 

As Blackrock grew, Aladdin grew. The firm bought Merrill Lynch Investment Managers in 2006, taking it deeper into Europe and into equities markets. In 2009 it bought Barclays Global Investors, taking it into exchange traded funds. Billions of assets under management became trillions of assets under management.

But the firm’s big break came in 2008, during the financial crisis. Around the world, governments struggled to evaluate the risk exposure in the portfolios of their banks. The banks themselves couldn’t help due to their obvious conflicts, so governments called on Blackrock to value exposures. Aladdin was used by the Fed when it took on the assets of Bear Stearns, and then by the Treasury in the broader bailout. By the end of 2008, Aladdin’s services were used by 135 clients, covering $7 trillion of assets. 

Since then, Blackrock’s technology platform has kept on growing. It has been hired for short-term projects of the kind it did for General Electric and the Fed. During the European debt crisis it was hired by the central banks of Ireland, Greece and the ECB.

More significantly, it is also used as an investment and risk management system for institutional investors globally. The platform monitors 2,000+ risk factors each day – from interest rates to currencies – and performs 5,000 portfolio stress tests and 180 million option-adjusted calculations each week. This enables it to provide an enterprise view of a firm’s risk. Investment managers who want to see what their overall exposure is to airlines or hospitality, say, can do so in a click. Alongside other features such as portfolio management, trading and operations, Aladdin positions itself as “an operating system for investment professionals.”

Today, Aladdin has over 250 clients. It has taken on 18 even since the pandemic began. Clients include asset owners like the California State Teachers’ Retirement System and other asset managers like Schroders and Vanguard. 

Like many software systems, the platform is quite sticky. Implementation can take 12-18 months, but once the client's on board, they’re on board—renewal rates are in the high 90’s of percent. Fees are based on criteria such as the value of positions, number of users or accomplishment of specific deliverables. JPMorgan became a client in 2016, paying $1.5 million for integration, plus annual fees that grew to $5.3 million last year.

Aladdin’s growth comes from more clients, greater penetration of those clients, and more products. Last year Blackrock spent $1.3 billion to acquire eFront to inject illiquid investment expertise into the platform. eFront is a leading software and solutions provider in the alternative investment management space. The firm also rolled out Aladdin Wealth to service the wealth management market. It currently has 16 clients there, including Morgan Stanley. 

### Too Big to Fail
Aladdin started out as a cost centre deep inside Blackrock (its “central nervous system”) but has evolved into a robust profit centre. The company doesn’t break down Aladdin’s full financials (despite its size, Blackrock still operates as a single business segment) but as a software business its margin is likely very high. It’s a strategy other financial services companies are looking to pursue. Goldman Sachs has long marketed itself as a technology company, with 25% of its workforce being engineers (“more engineers than Facebook”) yet for now its financials don’t reflect one. 

Blackrock faces two problems as its platform business grows. First is the conflicts it may trigger. Its investment managers have stakes in companies which are also Aladdin clients. Investment managers are familiar with conflicts of interest—their clients want investment performance; they want business performance. But this type of conflict – between client segments – is entirely different. It’s the type of conflict that investment banks normally grapple with, not investment management firms. 

Second, like all platforms, there’s a point at which it gets so big it becomes systemic. Some may argue it’s already there. The company stopped reporting how many trillions of assets sit on the Aladdin platform at the beginning of 2017. The last reported number was $20 trillion. Earlier this year, the FT calculated that a third of Aladdin’s clients have $21.6 trillion on the platform. According to the FT, that figure alone is equivalent to 10% of global stocks and bonds. 

The concern is that with so much money managed off the same risk system, portfolios will begin to look alike. The Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association tendered for a risk management solution earlier this year. Their concern with Aladdin was “potential groupthink” on the basis that Blackrock’s asset management teams use the identical platform in their investment process. 

Not a month after the retirement association made their decision, Blackrock rolled out a coronavirus stress-test scenario to Aladdin clients. It would be interesting to see how those clients performed in the ensuing market turmoil in late February/March and to what extent Aladdin influenced herding. Market correlations rose to 20 year highs in the period, which isn’t a surprise – they always rise in periods of stress – but what impact Aladdin may have had is a question few have asked. 

The flipside is the benefit that comes from bringing together so much data on one platform. Blackrock markets Aladdin’s collective intelligence on the basis that it “gets better with every new user, and every new asset that joins the platform”. This is true of most platforms built around data. In this case clients have to trade off the value of that collective intelligence with the potential groupthink that comes with it. 

One of Aladdin’s clients, European insurer NN Group, thinks it’s found a solution. In June, they said:

“Now we have a state-of-the-art platform in BlackRock Aladdin… Man and machine as a combination is an important driver for us to look at ways to generate more alpha, more investment returns for our clients.”

Man and machine. The genie and the lamp.
