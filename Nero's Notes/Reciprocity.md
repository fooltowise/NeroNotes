A lot of people seem to expect the world to just hand them wings without putting any effort. This is a poor strategy because it doesn't align with the human behavior you can observe around you every day. 

Reciprocation teaches us that if you give people cynicism and curtness or nothing at all, you are likely to receive the same. But if you give people opportunity and the benefit of the doubt, you will, more often than not, be on the receiving end of the same behavior.

Become what you want to see in the world and it will be so. If you want an amazing relationship with your partner be an amazing partner. If you want people to listen to you, listen to them. The best way to achieve success is to deserve success. Small changes in your actions change your entire world.

People tend to receive what they offer to the world. Thus to change our world, we must change what we offer to others. Reciprocity teaches us to be mindful of how our actions tend to come back on us. It's important to remember that we are part of the world, and thus our actions do not happen in isolation, but are instead part of an interconnect web of effects.
