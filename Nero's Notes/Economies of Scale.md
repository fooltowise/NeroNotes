### Types of economies of scale
1. Technical: Large capital equipment with large fixed costs
2. Specialization: Division of labor and specialization within production: more efficient and high output
3. Bulk Buying: Lower average cost for buying large quantities
4. Marketing: National ad campaign more efficient for high sales and [[Brands]] awareness
5. Risk Bearing: Bigger firms are more able to survive downturns
6. Container Principle: Increase in surface area leads to an even bigger increase in volume (see [[Limits to Isometric Scaling| Isometric Scaling]] and [[Properties that scale]])
7. Financial: Bigger companies get better and cheaper financing and interest rates
8. External: when a company benefits from the whole industry increasing in size
