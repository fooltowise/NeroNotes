# How will you measure your life

1. Find your passion  
2. Follow a path but be open to opportunity  
3. Make sure your actions match your priorities, plans, goals, strategy  
4. Don't neglect family friends when all is well. They won't be there when you need them or want to enjoy those relationships  
5. Don't be cats in the cradle. Spend time with your family when you're young, when you can  
6. Figure out what 'job' your spouse and family need you to play to be happy and do that. Make sure you're right. (Analogy is a product fitting a 'job': chocolate milkshake is morning commute activity that happens to last a while and prevent AM hunger...learning this helped make the milkshake thicker, don't worry about making it healthy)  
7. Don't outsource what you need to be successful, core competencies. Don't outsource your child's development and don't rob them of life lessons, failures, getting caught doing something wrong.  
8. Let your kids make decisions, fail, succeed on their own  
9. Family culture is there whether you plan or not. Decide what your family values and stands for and be consistent. Don't let just this once happen, be consistent. You can shape culture to some degree that way  
10. Don't compromise on your values, ethics. No just this once I'll let myself do do something I believe to be wrong. Slippery slope, easier to commit 100% and be consistent than to stay at 98%..you'll end up making more compromises because each decision is small but on whole can be big. Barings bank for example  
11. Have and define and revisit your purpose. Likeness: who do you want to be, how to behave, what influence on others....commitment...metrics: how to measure how you're doing
