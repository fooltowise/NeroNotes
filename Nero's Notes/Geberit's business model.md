Geberit is a Swiss sanitary systems manufacturer, and its business model is based on the [[Agency Business Model]] (see also [[The Friendly Middleman]]).

The company sells its product to plumbers via wholesalers who then install them in the in the end-customer's home or commercial building.
Geberit has a push-pull marketing strategy whereby plumbers are educated to "pull" the product through the wholesale channel, and company sales representatives ''push"the product to wholesalers. 
There is no pricing pressure because plumbers welcome price increases, since they are paid on a percentage commission basis for the system installation.

This model encourages innovation - in Geberit's case, it might be a new pre-wall installation system - as the plumber-agent finds it easier to persuade customers to pay up for novelty. This had led to frantic product development at Geberit, where around a third of the company's sales derive from products introduced over the last three years.

The somewhat unholy alliance between Geberit and plumbers has produced a deep profit pool, from which Geberit takes a healthy share (it enjoys margins of over 15% at the group operating profit level).

The company's high market share - around 50% in its seven core European markets - and the fragmentation of the plumbing industry help to maintain profitability.

Geberit is the European leader in lavatory products such as toilet flushing systems and pipes. Founded in 1874 as a plumbing business in Rapperswil, Switzerland, it gained momentum a generation later when the fouder's son expanded into the production of cisterns for flush toilets. Since then, related technology has evolved to put an ever-increasing portion of the plumbing behind walls, to save space and for a better look. Geberit hastened this trend with its introduction in 1964 of the first concealed flushing cistern - it has sold more than 60 million since. 

The behind-the-wall trend shifted industry focus from design to technology; it also made installation and repair more challenging.  For bathroom builders and owners, once the aesthetics of such products were no longer relevant, choice became a function of reliability and price. In such circumstances, customers tend to rely on qualified experts - in this case, licensed plumbers. Geberit has made the plumbing trade its friendly middleman. 

As with end customers, plumbers seek quality products, ideally those that are easy to install and unlikely to break. Unlike end customers, however, plumbers are insensitive to price, because the end customer pays the bill. By nurturing strong relationships with plumbers, Geberit capitalizes on this gap between decision makers and end customers. 

Aside from strengths rivals may pursue as keenly, like wide product availability and strong technical support, Geberit's tactics enrich its relationship-based strategy in several distinctive ways.  Geberit provides plumbers and apprentices with free training on product installation, on-site if required. The program builds loyalty through product familiarity and saves plumbers the time and cost of apprentice schooling. In a typical year, Geberit's sales force might conduct 200'000 customer visits to plumbers, architects, and other target groups.

Furthermore, Geberit protects plumbers by stressing both ease of installation and lifetime reliability. This long-term product dependability enables Geberit to protect and promote plumber reputations.

To sustain these relationship commitments, Geberit invests substantially in R&D, with an annual budget exceeding $50 million. The investment helps develop products that responds to customer demands and to comply with changing building codes.  For example, recent regulations in many locales mandate noise-reducing pipes for apartments and hotels, and Geberit makes compliant products that ease the burden - and risks of violations - for plumbers. 

Geberit amplifies the value of these distinctive tactics by operating counter-cyclically. While rivals retreat during construction and renovation downturns, Geberit takes advantage of plumber downtime to increase training and loyalty-building efforts.  The strategy delivers even during the downtime. For example, despite challenging economic conditions since 2006 in France, Geberit's sales have nearly doubled in this market. 

Consistency and predictability are Geberit's hallmarks, thanks to these strategies as well as an outstanding management team and corporate culture supporting them not only in production but across operations. Operating margins are high and grow steadily (from 14.6% in 2002 to 24% recently) with highly efficient working capital and significant pricing power (compounding at about 2% since 2002); return on capital is strong and rising consistently (from 14% in 2002 to 35% in 2014); and market share gains are reliable, with ten-year compounded annual volume growth of some 3.6% despite the contraction of the European construction market.
