# Opportunity Costs


> Opportunity cost is a huge filter in life. If you've got two suitors who are really eager to have you and one is way the hell better than the other, you do not have to spend much time with the other. And that's the way we filter out buying opportunities.
 — Charlie Munger
 
 As investors, we are in the business of intelligently allocating capital. However, with limited capital at our disposal and several alternatives, the critical concept of opportunity cost arises. An opportunity cost is defined as the value of the second-best opportunity that we forgo when we make a choice. In a world where alternatives are mutually exclusive and we must choose A over B, or B over A, our opportunity cost would be the potential gain of B if we choose A, and vice versa.
 
 Munger has shared important insights on this subject over the years:
 > I would argue that one filter that's useful in investing is the idea of opportunity cost. If you have one idea that's available in large quantity that's better than 98% of the other opportunities, then you can just screen out the other 98%.

>I just wanted to do the best I could reasonably do with the talent, time and resources I had available. That's what I was doing then and now. Everything is based on opportunity costs. Academia has made a terrible disservice: they teach in one sentence in first-year economics about opportunity costs, but that's it. In life, opportunity A is better than opportunity B, and you have only one opportunity, to do A. There's no one-size-fits-all. If you're really wise and fortunate, you get to be like Berkshire. We have high opportunity costs. We always have something we like and can buy more of, so that's what we compare everything to. All of you are in the game of taking the lot you have right now and improving it based on your opportunity cost. Think of how life is simplified if you approach it this way.
[[Berkshire Hathaway]] is constantly kicking off ideas in about two seconds flat. We know we've got opportunity X, which is better than the new opportunity. Why do we want to waste two seconds thinking about the new opportunity? Many of you come from places that don't do that. You've got to have one horse, one rabbit, one something or rather, and that rabbit is going to be thinking about something which would be ruled out immediately by an opportunity cost available generally to the place - but, it's a different department. You have to be diversified and so on and so on. It's easy to drift into this idea that opportunities don't matter,  you've got so many different ways of doing things that are better. It isn't better.
If you take the best text in economics by Mankiw, he says intelligent people make decisions based on opportunity costs - in other words, it's your alternatives that matter. That's how we make all of our decisions.



In another interview, Munger said:
 > When someone presented a company in an emerging market to Warren Buffett, Warren said: "I don't feel more comfortable buying this than I feel about adding to our position in Wells Fargo." He thinks highly of the company and the managers and the position they were in. He was using this as his opportunity cost. He was saying, "Don't talk about anything unless it's better than buying more Wells Fargo." It doesn't matter to Warren where the opportunity is. He has no preconceived idea about whether Berkshire's money ought to be in this or that. He's scanning the world trying to get his opportunity cost as high as he can so his individual decisions would be better.

Munger's words have significant implications for investors. If you expect to achieve a much higher level of returns from one stock that you do not expect to achieve in the others, then why should you continue allocating capital to the rest of them? Wouldn't it make more sense to remain fully invested until a much better return opportunity appears? All too often, investors succumb to the "do something" syndrome and relax their standards for incoming investments instead of firmly maintaining a very high hurdle rate at all times. Be unreasonable.

> It's a funny thing about life. If you refuse to accept anything but the best, you very often get it. — W. Somerset Maugham

Capital is finite and always carries an opportunity cost - what you can do with the next best alternative. If your next best alternative is 1%, your opportunity cost is 1%, and if it is 10%, the cost is 10%, no matter what some formula created in academia might say. Always remember - the highest and best use of capital should always be measured by the next best possible use.

> If I know I have something that yields 8% for sure, and something else came along at 7%, I'd reject it instantly. Everything is a function of opportunity cost. — Warren Buffett

During the 2014 annual meeting, Buffett and Munger explained why evaluating one's opportunity cost is the most logical way to think about cost of capital:

**Buffett:** Charlie and I view our cost of capital as what can be produced by our second best idea.

**Munger:** I've never heard an intelligent cost of capital discussion. Warren's way of having every dollar retained having to produce at least a dollar of market value is the best way to describe our cost of capital. But that's not what people mean when they say it, especially in business schools. But it's simple; our way is right and their's is wrong.

If a business doesn't earn a return that investors could earn elsewhere, then for all practical purposes that business destroys value, from an investor's standpoint. Another way of saying this is that if the return on capital isn't equal to or better that the cost of capital (what investors could earn elsewhere), then the business is in effect destroying value for shareholders.
