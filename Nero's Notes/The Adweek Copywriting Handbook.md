# The Adweek [[Copywriting]] Handbook


**Axiom 1: [[Copywriting]] is a mental process the successful execution of which reflects the sum total of all your experiences, your specific knowledge and your ability to mentally process that information and transfer it onto a sheet of paper for the purpose of selling a product or a service.**



**Axiom 2: All the elements in an advertisement are primarily designed to do one thing and one thing only: get your to read the first sentence of the copy.**

**Axiom 3: The sole purpose of the first sentence in an advertisement is to get you to read the second sentence.**

Make that first sentence so easy to read that your reader is almost compelled to read it. (Hint: your first sentence should be short.)


**Axiom 4: Your ad layout and the first few paragraphs of your ad must create the buying environment most conducive to the sale of your product or service.**

**Axiom 5: Get the reader to say yes and harmonise with your accurate and truthful statements while reading your copy.**

**Axiom 6: Your readers should be so compelled to read your copy that they cannot stop reading until they read all of it as if sliding down a slippery slide.**

**Axiom 7: When trying to solve problems, don't assume constraints that aren't really there.**

**Axiom 8: Keep the copy interesting and the reader interested through the power of curiosity.**

Some seeds of curiosity:
- But there's more.
- So read on.
- But I didn't stop there.
- Let me explain.
- Now here comes the good part.
**Axiom 9: Never sell a product or service. Always sell a concept.**


**Axiom 10: The incubation process is the power of your subconscious mind to use all your knowledge and experiences to solve a specific problem, and its efficiency is dictated by time, creative orientation, environment and ego.**

**Axiom 11: Copy should be long enough to cause the reader to take the action you request.**
Two additional factors: 
- The higher the price point, the more you'll need to educate your prospect.
- The more unusual the item, the more you'll need to educate your prospect.

**Axiom 12: Every communication should be a personal one, from the writer to the recipient, regardless of the medium used.**


**Axiom 13: The ideas presented in your copy should flow in a logical fashion, anticipating your prospect's questions and answering them as if the questions were asked face to face.**

**Axiom 14: In the editing process, you refine your copy to express exactly what you want to express with the fewest words.**

**Axiom 15: Selling a cure is a lot easier than selling a preventive, unless the preventive is perceived as a cure or the curative aspects of the preventive are emphasised.**


## Emotions in advertising

- Emotion principle 1: Every word has an emotion associated with it and tells a story.
- Emotion principle 2: Every good ad is an emotional outpouring of words, feelings and impressions.
- Emotion principle 3: You sell on emotion, but you justify a purchase with logic.



## Some principles for editing:
1. look for any "that" words. The words up to and including "that" can very often be eliminated.
2. Edit for rhythm. Make sure that you vary the length of sentences so that they don't sound monotonous.
3. Consider combining sentences.
4. Eliminate unnecessary words
5. Rearrange thoughts so they flow better.






## Powerful copy elements:
1. Typeface: use serif on paper (on screen, sans-serif is better because serif does not fit well with the pixel grid)
2. First sentence - short, easy to read and compelling enough to cause the reader to read the next sentence
3. Second sentence - You've got to maintain interest - create another sentence to cause your reader to want to continue
4. Paragraph headings - their primary purpose is to get the reader to read the copy by making the copy look less intimidating
5. Product explanation - explain a complicated product in a simple way and a simple product in a very complex way.
6. Highlight new features
7. Technical explanations: a few "expert" passages go a long way to convince the reader that the seller knows what he is talking about.
8. Anticipate objections.
9. Resolve objections.
10. Gender - Who is the consumer?
11. Clarity. Your copy should be clear, simple, short and to the point.
12. Avoid clich√©s.
13. Rhythm - a mixture of sentence lengths that, when read together, gives a sense of variety and rhythm.
14. Service - Needed if selling an expensive product.
15. Physical facts - mention dimensions and weight.
16. Include a trial period.
17. Price comparison - whenever possible, offering a price comparison to another product establishes value in the mind of the purchaser.
18. Testimonials - gives social proof. Even better when endorsed by a celebrity (but there should be a logical connection.)
19. Price - If bargain, should be in bold. Otherwise, don't hide it, but underplay it.
20. Offer summary - It's a really good idea to summarise what you are offering the consumer somewhere near the end of your ad.
21. Avoid saying too much
22. Ease of ordering - make is easy to order
23. Ask for the order.
