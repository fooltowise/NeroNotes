**Thank you for taking the time, greatly appreciate you signing on. As a brief background, I run a very concentrated global fund and currently have a position in DinoPolska. We're hoping you can give us some interesting things about the Polish grocery market and learn more about Dino?**

I hope so. I have been in the Polish retail market for over 30 years, mainly in the buying department. I work for the biggest retailer and spend a lot of my time analyzing all the competitive players in the Polish retail market, especially Dino, who I know from the very beginning 30 years ago when Mr Biernacki opened the first stores in Poland.

**Given your wide background, how does the Polish market differ to the other markets you have seen. Are there any unique features as it relates to food retail and grocery chains in Poland?**

In the 1990s, we saw many changes connected to the political background in Poland. It became more concentrated and organized. Although there have been some changes over the last 20 to 30 years, the Polish market is still not very concentrated. Poland has modern trade, with organized chains such as Biedronka, who are the biggest retailer in Poland with 3,500 stores. We also have all the big players in the discount area such as Lidl, Aldi and Netto. There are also hypermarket such as Auchan, Kaufland and Carrefour, as well as supermarket stores such as Carrefour and SPAR. In addition to those, there are Polish owned stores such as Polomarket.

The organized portion is approximately 30% to 35% of the total retail market, so there remains a strong non-organized retail. There are many single private food stores. Many years ago, you could buy fresh fruit, vegetables and meat directly from producers, which remains part of the Polish retail market. If we want to focus on the modern trade, and specifically Dino, they currently have 1,700 stores and are the most dynamically developing retail company in Poland. Their store size ranges from 350 to 550 square meters with a parking area, 90% of which are newly built. When it comes to the assortment range, Dino has 3,200 to 3,400 SKUs which is 1,000 more than discounters such as Lidl or Biedronka who operate with 2,200 to 2,300 SKUs in their regular assortment.

**If 65% are still mom-and-pop stores, what is the future for those stores? Could they be consolidated into a Biedronka or Dino over the next five years?**

There is no future for those stores but Covid has given them a lifeline because, from a customer perspective, they remain a very convenient solution. If the standard of those stores is acceptable to Biedronka, they could buy them, but there are also many small local store chains of 10 to 20 locations who operate under one logo and have one private owner. These are slowly being sold to the biggest operators. In the past few months, 100 stores were sold to Eurocash, who are the biggest Polish wholesaler. They are developing an operation in cooperation with private stores on a franchise basis where a private owner signs a contract with a big operator like Makro cash-and-carry or Eurocash, and operate under their own brand but with their assortment and delivery made by Eurocash. Today, Eurocash deliver to 15,000 of these small private stores, which makes them much more organized.

**Just to clarify when you say unorganized market, are you talking about the small mom-and-pop stores with one store and one owner, and the organized market has 10 to 15 stores with a private owner, and that those are gradually being sold to bigger operators? Is that a fair summary of those markets?**

That is the trend because private stores are no longer attractive compared to Biedronka or Lidl and need support from Eurocash to give them better buying conditions. They offer promotional support and allow then to better communicate with their end customers. One specific situation in Poland is the Żabka convenience chain stores which are very small, between 70 and 150 square meters. They are located in the center of big cities and have over 7,500 stores in Poland. They have a basic assortment of 1,500 to 1,800 SKUs, the majority of which are alcohol, cigarettes and drinks. They are the most expensive stores but people accept their prices because of the advantages they offer.

**You mentioned Eurocash acquired many mom-and-pop private stores; any idea as to what valuation multiples they paid for those stores, in terms of sales or earnings or cash flow?**

Normal market price depending on EBITDA values. For a chain of stores that makes $2 million a year, the normal price is 10 to 12 times their annual EBITDA.

**Okay, got it.**

Everything depends on the condition of the small player. If the condition is wrong or their EBITDA is low then the price is related to the financial result of these stores.

**There are many players including big superstores like Carrefour and Lidl and players as small as Żabka; how do they compete with Dino? They have been successful so far but this competition seems to be intense. Is that a big threat for Dino because of how and where they operate?**

Dino have no strong competition because they are not located in cities with more than 20,000 inhabitants; they are mainly in very small cities and villages with no competition. A big advantage Dino has over Biedronka or Lidl is the cost of their stores. Dino can build a store for $400,000 whereas for Biedronka it costs $600,000 and for Lidl it's over $1 million. The cost of land in big cities like Poznan, Warsaw, Krakow or Wroclaw is $5 million, compared to less than $100,000 in small cities and villages. If we add up all those costs, Dino have a very low sales expectation and their breakeven point is less than $100,000 per month. Lidl need to make $600,000 and Biedronka need $300,000 per month on average. From a cost structure and sales expectation to make a positive financial result on a per store basis, Dino has the advantage compared to the main players on the market.

Approximately 12 years ago Mr Biernacki sold a 49% share to private equity and invested 200 million Zloty into 1,000 pieces of land. The cost, at the time, was $15,000 to $20,000 per piece of land, and he is building his stores in these places. That means the cost of building and land is extremely low compared to Lidl or Biedronka. It is very difficult to be competitive with Dino because they are unable to build to this cost and the sales expectation is too high for these small villages. Two or three years ago, Biedronka developed a comparable and competitive format to Dino, 450 square meters with a franchising contract for the owner. They are growing in the neighborhood of Dino stores and the first 20 to 30 stores were opened two years ago in the central part of Poland where Dino started. They are located in the region between Wroclaw and Poznan; that is the main area where the first Dino stores were opened, more than 20 years ago. It is too early to know the results of this new format.

**Which other aspects do Dino have a competitive advantage? We heard about the fresh meat counter where they process and provide their own meat, how much does that weigh into their competitive advantage?**

I told you before that Biedronka have 2,200 SKUs and Dino has 1,000 SKUs more, which makes Dino more attractive. Another advantage is their meat counter. Lidl tested this concept a few years ago and were not successful. They sold it another way by putting special vitrines in big stores but that was a bad solution. Biedronka tested the meat counter for more than 10 years. Many of their newly opened stores were equipped with a meat counter which sold fresh meat, sausages and cheese. Poland customers traditionally buy more fresh products than those which are packaged. On one side, this is an advantage for Dino but a disadvantage is that they only have one supplier, who is Mr Biernacki's brother, and is not a recognizable brand in the Polish market. The quality is acceptable but you cannot find recognizable brands.

**You mentioned that you know Tomasz Biernacki or have followed him for a while; we have not been able to talk to him or anybody who knows him personally. Can you give explain who he is, what is his background and why he is so reclusive?**

Tomasz Biernacki is a private Polish businessman and investor. He started over 25 years ago and opened several unsuccessful small store concepts. After a joint venture with private equity, he developed Dino, and all his ideas are followed through by his management. In my opinion, he is the owner of Dino’s successful concept. Mr Biernacki does not speak to the press, and little is known about his private life. Several years ago, a journalist took a picture of Mr Biernacki, which was impossible to share in the press.

**Have you worked with him or do you know him personally?**

I know him personally but never worked with Dino. Mr Biernacki knows how he should develop the company and he likes the situation he has created in the market.

**Does he remind you of any other executive you have come across, either in Poland or more importantly in the Western world?**

Mr Piduch was the CEO of Dino for 15 years, but no longer works for Mr Biernacki. One year ago, I noticed that Mr Piduch was no longer CEO of Dino, but after two months I hear he was working for private equity with fuel stations. The private equity enterprise investor was a 49% shareholder of Dino for many years, while Mr Biernacki kept 51%. The private equity have tried to sell it but Mr Biernacki rejected the sale. They have chosen to sell their share via the stock exchange. The company remains 100% controlled by Mr Biernacki.

**There seems to be a lot of white space in the eastern part of the country. Do you think Biedronka, Lidl and Stokrotka cannot compete in those areas by starting smaller format stores like Dino? Do the problems in the west also exist in the east?**

Dino have the most potential to develop in the Eastern part of Poland. They have over 500 localizations and are able to build their stores from scratch. There is no way that Stokrotka could be competitive. The typical supermarket store with 9,000 SKU is incomparable to the attractive prices of Dino stores. The franchised format of Eurocash also cannot compete with Dino, who open 200 to 250 stores per year. Mr Biernacki has so many pieces of land he can buy in the more attractive parts of eastern Poland, but they are waiting to reach their limit in the more attractive central and western parts of Poland. I know he spoke Arhelan, one of the biggest local retailers in the Eastern part of Poland, but they rejected his offer to take over of the Arhelan brand and change the logo to Dino. Another point is that Dino have very attractive prices for vodka and other alcohol products, which are very successful in villages. Many people buy vodka for their wedding from Dino because they have the lowest price in the market.

**How is online delivery growing in Poland? Is that a threat to Dino at all**

During the pandemic many players have developed their online sales, but I have not heard about Dino offering online sales to its customers. The Spanish company Glovo are working with Biedronka to deliver their entire assortment within two hours. I have not heard whether Lidl has some concept. I know Żabka are able to deliver to customers very quickly but they will need to find an external company to handle deliveries. All of them are trying but none are successful. Over the past few months, the dark store format has become popular. Perhaps you know about Gorillas?

**You are talking about dark store grocery stores which have no customers entering them.**

They guarantee delivery of fresh products within 10 minutes of placing an order. Another store concept has no personnel and the business is run like a giant vending machine. Żabka have opened a several of these stores with an assortment of 250 SKUs. I know they are developing the concept with 350 SKUs to include fresh fruit and vegetables, dairy and meat. They have less than 10 stores so there are no scale effects yet. I have not heard about online sales for Dino. They are close enough to their customers in villages and small cities. The dark store concept stores are all located in big cities where there is no competition to Dino.

**How many more stores could Dino open and once they accomplish that, do they go to bigger cities?**

Dino could open 1,200 more locations in Poland. If they want to fight with Lidl or Biedronka, they would have to enter the big cities. If they keep the current concept, there is no room for more than 1,200 stores in Poland. Their stores are inexpensive to build but what could happen to them after 10 years if their quality is not so good? It could be problematic, because they are not built as strong as those of Biedronka, Lidl or Aldi. Maybe the investment to remodel these stores after 10 years makes no sense, and it will be better to move it and build a one from scratch. I am not sure if Mr Biernacki is pushing the business as strong as possible and could go out of business after several years, and sell his shares once he reaches the top. It is a good idea to invest in Dino stock but not for the next 20 years.

**Many Dino stores are still young; how long does it take to reach maturity?**

That's difficult to say. If you have 200 stores and open 200 more in one year, after two years you end up with 50% new stores and 50% old stores, whereas if you have 2,000 stores and open 200 stores in a year, only 10% of your stores are new. From a time perspective, the share of modern stores decreases and, in my opinion, the ceiling is 3,200 stores in Poland.

**When you were involved with many other stores, were there any specific operating metrics you focused on in trying to understand the operating efficiency of those stores, such as like-for-like sales, and did you look at Dino using those metrics?**

Dino stores have a different cost structure compared to Lidl and can therefore realize slightly lower average margins on sales, to achieve very positive EBITDA results. An average, a Lidl store has 16 staff members whereas Dino have less than 10. When a Dino opens, people are attracted to their low prices and wide assortment.

**One of the things that has caught many people's attention is the ongoing struggles between Warsaw and Brussels. There has been talk about of Polexit like Brexit. Is that possible and if so, what are the repercussions for Dino and Poland?**

The media is full of information on the conflict between Warsaw and Brussels, but the Polish people will never accept a Polexit. Poland is not as strong as Great Britain to leave the European Union and sell much more than what we buy. There are many disadvantages in leaving. England have big problems after Brexit and Poland will be three times more difficult. In my opinion, it is not possible, even if we change the government in Poland. People will protest on the streets because they will not be managed by a government with a stupid idea.

**If you were to invest in grocery stores in Poland, would you invest in Dino?**

Yes. For the following two to three years, 100% for sure. Perhaps my opinion is wrong, but we will see how the situation looks after two years. If Dino open new stores with positive results, the business is under the control of the owner. The pandemic has had a very positive influence for stores such as Dino, where there is less risk for catching Covid. Many of the discounters have seen two-digit growth in the last year, which means they are developing very strongly because shopping malls were closed and big stores were no longer popular amongst Polish customers. For this reason, people prefer small neighborhood stores like Dino, Żabka, Lidl and Biedronka which are not located in shopping malls.

**If for some reason Dino has not done well over the next five years, what could be the reasons for that?**

They have enough space with positive results to make some mistakes on the way, but over the next five years anything is possible. Everyone has both good and bad times in their life, and Mr Biernacki has mostly had a good time. In my opinion, he is a businessman who has a very good feel for the market and the decisions he has taken have been successful. Dino is currently developing the most in the market compared to Lidl, Biedronka and others. No other company in Poland is opening such a high number of stores.

There is no direct competition between Dino and Aldi or Lidl, therefore Dino can do what they want without influencing others. These businesses are running in parallel and do not destroy one another. Lidl could create a new 300 square meter store format and directly compete with Dino but I do not believe that will happen. From my experience and knowledge about the company, that is impossible. They will concentrate in the places they are winning, to build an even better position in the places they are strong, without competing against Dino in the villages.
