# Geographic Expansion
Sometimes, successful domestic businesses reach a point in their existing markets where gaining share becomes tougher and they turn their attention elsewhere.

**Geographic expansion is one of the most challenging strategies for businesses to implement.**

Failed attempts are legions and can prove damaging to the original franchises. But if a company has cracked the code in a handful of markets, it increases the odds that it can do so repeatedly.

[[Unilever]], the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods company, has been building great franchises in emerging markets for more than a century. Past success of geographic expansion can be an indicator of future success.

Companies that rely on unique business structures for competitive advantage at home will face the greatest difficulty expanding geographically. Advantages that derive from an unique distribution system, localized scale advantages or favorable regulatory treatment may not be replicable abroad. The inability of grocery retailers, hospital operators and airlines to globalize their business successfully testifies to this effect.

Conversely, certain types of competitive advantage travel better abroad than others. **Thanks to the globalization of travel and media, premium brands transition relatively easily into new markets.**  Louis Vuitton and [[Nike]] are well known in all countries  of the world, even when their merchandise is not yet available. Manufacturers operating their own stores enjoy a particular advantage, as their vertical integration makes them less reliant on a country's infrastructure.
