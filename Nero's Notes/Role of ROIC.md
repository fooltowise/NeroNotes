# Role of ROIC

  
The Role of ROIC :-  
Consider two hypothetical companies.  
ABC Corporation and XYZ Industries both have earnings of $1 per share. (We have switched the discussion here from dividends to earnings, because ultimately we want to talk about price/earnings ratios, but in the simplified world of this discussion, each company’s dividend will grow at the same rate as its earnings.)  
  
Suppose that both companies would like to grow their earnings by 6% over the next year. What would it take for each company to do that?  
  
Growing your earnings requires that you invest some capital to expand your business. How much capital would each company have to invest in order to achieve a 6% increase in earnings?  
  
The answer clearly depends on what kind of return each company can earn when it invests capital in its business — in other words, how much additional profit is created for each dollar of capital it invests.  
  
Suppose that ABC is able to earn an ROIC of 20%, meaning that for every dollar it reinvests in its business, it earns 20% of that dollar back in additional profit.  
  
In order to grow its overall profits by 6%, it would need to reinvest 30% of this year’s profit, since a 20% return on 30% of the existing profit will create 6% more profit. That means that ABC is free to distribute 70% of this year’s profit — or 70 cents per share — to shareholders, either as cash dividends, stock repurchases or debt reductions.  
  
Meanwhile, XYZ is not as fortunate as ABC. It only earns a 10% ROIC on capital it invests in its business. If it reinvested the same 30% of its profit as ABC, it would only generate 3% in additional profit (10% times 30% = 3%).  
So in order to grow at the same 6% as ABC, it needs to reinvest 60% of its earnings, leaving just 40 cents of the $1 in profit per share to distribute to shareholders, compared to ABC’s 70 cents.  
  
As these examples illustrate, there is a simple equation that describes the relationship between profit growth and ROIC.  
The key figure that ties the two together is the reinvestment rate:  
  
Reinvestment Rate × ROIC = Profit Growth  
  
Conclusion:-  
The job of an active manager is to identify alpha opportunities — situations where the manager believes the market price of a stock is incorrect, and then compare it to the market price, as if that price is just an exogenous number.  
  
The market price contains information. Part of the process of deciding that the market price is incorrect has to involve figuring out what assumptions the market is making about the three key variables — the company’s free cash flow, its growth rate and its cost of capital — that drive the "fundamental value of the business". Without that analysis, you are not making an informed judgement.
