# Corporate Candor
Good management extends beyond good execution to outside constituents. From the investing perspective, that means effectively communicating to investors what is important and why. It also means being candid and speaking in a straightforward professional manner rather than indulging in the elliptical spin politicians favor. It also means speaking directly and honestly about events, not wrapping a message in prose developed by a public relations or corporate communications team. These traits should be on display in all settings, from formal periodic reports to occasional in-person meetings and regular earnings calls.
