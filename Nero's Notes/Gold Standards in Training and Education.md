# Gold Standards in Training and Education

Other gold standards originate in training. Many professions require members to use certain types of programs, from medical diagnostic equipment to engineering and architectural software. Training can be costly and repeated use increases knowledge and switching costs and promotes standardization.

In finance, the proliferation of [[Microsoft]]'s Excel software illustrates an arc leading to the toll road: from school to basic training at firms to the corner suite, finance professionals and many people in other fields learn it, master it, and rely upon it. In engineering and architecture, the software used in universities becomes the software used in firms, yielding a self-reinforcing push for standardization: employers want well-trained students and universities want students who will be attractive in the job market.

Industries where educational training is paramount, therefore, are swiftly left with a narrow range of providers. Products become entrenched in education programs, which leads to adoption outside academia. The embedding of these products in the workplace adds strength to the dynamic, because retraining an entire staff can be expensive.
