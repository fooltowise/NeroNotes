# Workview Reflections

- Why work?
- What's work for?
- What does work mean?
- How does it relate to the individual, others, society?
- What defines good or worthwhile work?
- What does money has to do with it?
- What do experience, growth, and fulfillment have to do with it?


Work is the expenditure of someone's time and energy in order to provide a product or a service to a beneficiary. It follows that at least someone should benefit from this work. 

A work that does not bring any benefit to anybody is not work. It is a slow grind of the soul. Asking John to dig a hole and then Paul to fill it back up is not work but a useless waste of time and energy.

Society will reward someone's work based on two factors:
- How much benefits (value) the work provides to society.
- How hard is it to find someone else that could do the same work. This explains why teachers (which are plentiful) are paid less than software developers (of which society has a shortage of), even if teachers bring at least as much value as most developers.

Sometimes work can be beneficial to some people (usually the employer) while harmful to the rest of society. This often results in a good salary (first order effect) but mental pain (second order effect).

Work can be divided into two axis: 

1. Creative work vs non-creative work. Creative work is about generating new insights about how to incrementally make the world a better place (Inventing a solution to an unmet need, Finding new ways to improve a process or a product, Triggering emotions in an audience through one's writings or performing...). Non-creative work consists in the repetitive tasks needed to be carried in order to execute on these insights. Non-creative work tends to be automated away.
2. Leveraged vs Non-Leveraged. Work is leveraged if you only have to expense time and energy once to provide a benefit as many times as needed ("Build it once, Sell it twice"), i.e your personal marginal cost is negligible (or strongly decreasing). Work is not leveraged if your time and energy expenditure needs are constant or rising every time you need to provide the same benefit (ex: a craftsman). The sources of leverage are software, capital, intellectual property, and other people time and energy.


So we have 4 quadrants:
1. Non-Creative, Non-leveraged. Ex: Factory and Office workers
2. Creative, Non-Leveraged. Ex: Craftsmen
3. Creative, Leveraged. Ex: Entrepreneurs
4. Non-Creative, Leveraged: machines and software (i.e, work that has already been automated)


Good and worthwhile work is work that brings the biggest benefit to other people:
- either by providing a huge benefit to one person
- or by providing a small benefit to many people
- or by providing a huge benefit to many people (jackpot)
