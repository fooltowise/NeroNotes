### Could we start with your background and history?

I joined ICI Pharmaceuticals as a laboratory assistant back in 1976. It's a long time ago, and they became AstraZeneca about 15 years later. I started off as a research chemist, stayed there for five years, always interested in sales and business. At the age of 21, I applied for a role with a company called \[0:03:52 ALAGA\], which you probably know as \[0:03:54 Atvi/Advi\] these days, in the ophthalmic market space. I only stayed with them for around 10 months. I got head hunted by J&J to work in an area where I became really interested, which was in ophthalmic surgery, and I was put forward by an ophthalmologist who took a shine to me. My father died when I was 18 and this gentleman nurtured me through my early career. I was with J&J and, after two and a half years, got promoted to being Sales Manager and then Sales and Marketing Manager which was way above my ability. I was with them for two and a half years and then got headhunted again by a company called Pharmacia and was taken on as a sales manager for the UK at the age of just over 24. Within six months, they had me in Sweden as an international product manager for intraocular lenses. That was my specialist area and I really enjoyed that space; training doctors how to do intraocular lens insertions and so on. But they had an amazing product called \[Helong 0:05:07\], which was the first of the scholastics patented by Pharmacia to use in eye surgery, and also in joints. But that's another story.

I stayed in Sweden, in Uppsala, for two years and as a reward for that role, they said, where do you want to go next on this five-year development plan they had for me, which was to culminate in a senior position back in the UK? I said, I'd like to go to Australia, if that's all right with you. Within 10 days, I was promoted to head of the ophthalmic business unit in Australia and New Zealand. Within three months, I was residing in Sydney, Australia, which was great. Then during that first year, I set the business up, started the whole introduction of the pharmacy ophthalmic range in Australasia, set up the business' subsidiary, recruited people. I was 24, 25 years of age, I was learning as I went, but they trusted me. I then took over the whole Southeast Asian distribution markets working out of Hong Kong for six months, and then Singapore six months.

During that time, I noticed just how lucrative distribution was and could be. Then I went to the presidents of Pharmacia and said, I want to set up my own business and they tried to talk me out of it for three months with this lovely development plan back in Appenzell, and the senior management team. Not really with a position of power, but a position of learning, which was great. But I took the plunge and set up my own business that did well. It took two years and squeaky bum time, as we say in the UK for two years, making sure the cash flow was right, poking the heads of suppliers who wanted payments, all that kind of stuff. Then the business really took off in 1991-1992. It really started to grow. By 1996, it was doing extremely well.

What were you selling?

At that time, Staar intraocular lenses, which were the first foldable IOLs and then injectable IOLs for use in surgery following a favorable certification. Also some phaco equipment. It was absolutely the peak time. You couldn't fail unless you were dumb. Everybody needed a phaco machine. There were crazy deals on offer, the margins were phenomenal. The business grew fantastically well, margins at that time and distribution were at 55% to 60%, so really good. During that time, I set up some restaurants with a business partner. That was more glamour and vanity rather than anything else.

### This was still in Hong Kong, or where was this?

This was back in the UK. From that point forward, I met with a guy through my dealings with a supplier and we became good friends and interested in the technology. We developed, together with another chap, the disposable injector technology for IOLs. If you have heard of a company called Medicel AG, which is based actually in the Appenzell region of Switzerland. If you go 10 miles up the hill, you'll come to this very, very nice old building, which has now been replaced with a new place right next to Altenrhein airport. We started the business in 1996. We sold it to Halma PLC in 2011 for about $150 million US.

### When did you start this business?

Officially in 1996, but realistically, in 2002. It was an emerging time when we were selling bits and pieces that we could manufacture or buy from various places in the world. But then we started to seriously manufacture our own injection molded components. He was a very good friend who had fantastic ability of making micro surgical devices. In 2011, that was sold to Halma for a sizable sum.

### What was the relationship to Medicel? Was that the company you set up or was it a company that was making these things for you?

That was the company I set up together with my friend. We set the business up and managed it between us. Neil was the operations manager; I was more monthly board meetings and direction strategy and products. That was a very, very successful deal, but I had to keep my name out of these things because I didn't want my existing suppliers and other business relations to know that I was involved in that business.

### You still had the distribution business at this time?

I still run the distribution business and also I entered into a joint venture with TAYA Pharmaceuticals, in the UK in 2006. That was a joint venture, but the details around that was pretty specific that it was to be sold after seven years, for a multiple of turnover, which was a great deal. That executed in 2013, a year early than planned, but they paid a sizable sum for it so it was well worth the time to do that. Then in 2015, I decided I'd had enough and I was going to sell the distribution business, and this is where Stirling Square Capital Partners came in and acquired the business. They asked me to be CEO for the group, which reluctantly I took it on and did my best that I could with this structure, which Stirling Square didn't understand. I think that's the best, nicest and fairest way of describing their involvement. They did not understand the business, and they were leveraged with a high level of debt. The Covenant was always a challenge during that time. Like typical private equity, they were loaded with fees and loaded with costs, and yet still expected cash flow to improve. In 2017, I agreed to onboard a new CEO because I'd had enough. I was promoted to Chairman, if you can call that a promotion. At the same time, I joined Glaukos. I was going to retire at that time, to be honest. Two friends in the US said, why don't you come and have a chat with us? You know what those things are like. I knew what would happen, and I've been with Glaukos almost five years.

### What are you doing at Glaukos?

I'm the Vice President for Europe, Middle East, India and Africa. I have seven subsidiaries direct; I have 53 distribution markets and I have fantastic team of people. Very, very capable, super colleagues. Great leadership team. I'm in a good place and I've had a great time. That's my career, really. I'm sure there's a lot more I could tell you, but I spent approximately two and a half to three years working alongside Stirling Square who eventually messed with the figures, played around, screwed everybody and sold us to AddLife.

### Let's take a few steps back. Today, it's called Vision Ophthalmology Group so that was, if I understand correctly, a conglomeration of the business you sold to Stirling Square, but also some other businesses or maybe you can talk about the little bit of the history of how the group that AddLife bought came about?

Effectively, Stirling Square acquired Polytech-Domilens, and Polytech-Domilens is a German distributor, which was very successful. They had great margin management, lower quality products but sold – within the reimbursement system, because it was lucrative in Germany at that time – extremely well. They were businessmen, and they did a very, very good job. This business was sold to them in early 2015. It had already been previously involved with a northern German private equity/bank, which acquired it in 2012-2013, and the owner of that time and the management team were still involved when Stirling Square acquired Polytech-Domilens from this group.

This was a thriving business but there was a reason that they were trying to offload it. They had a hunch that the reimbursement arrangements in Germany were going to change, and they were right. They had good inside information into that space from market access people that they knew. The EBITDA around that time was somewhere around 9.6 million for that business. I'd been speaking to them for about a year before because they said, once we sell, would you be interested in selling to fit the story? I said, I will be interested, but I'm very mindful of my people; I want to make sure that the business continues to grow. Stirling Square gave all the assurances, they were fantastic in terms of selling the concept and selling private equity, being different than any other private equity provider, etc. So the business was acquired, and within six months, they already started to lose some of the agencies or distribution that they had with certain products. This was destabilizing to the business, but my acquisition went through when they acquired Spectrum Ophthalmics in the UK, which is the business I owned.

### So the company you sold into this was called Spectrum Ophthalmics?

It was evident that the only way we were really going to move forward was to find additional companies to acquire into the group. At that time – I'm talking now 2015-2016 – they had full ownership of Polytech-Domilens, full ownership of Spectrum Ophthalmics, 75% ownership of HOLI-MED in Poland and 75% ownership of Polytech Switzerland, which is another story altogether. They had just established an office in Spain, where they had taken on a useless individual but anyway, they'd taken them on to complete the story. It looks like this Pan-European distribution business was going somewhere, but as the EBITDA started to look a little bit shaky in 2015-2016, I managed to acquire a business – which was run by a gentleman called Marcus Gossi – called Medilas which was based close to Zurich. This business was bringing in an EBITDA at that time of around the same as Germany, where they acquired it, around 9.5 million Swiss francs, so pretty healthy margin on the sales level of around 24-25 million Swiss francs. Really good net margin.

However, we knew that at the time of acquisition that the reimbursement system in Switzerland, was under review but it was manageable, and still is manageable. We took a punt in buying this business. There were some aspects of that business which were questionable, but where there were any questions, we found answers and made sure that it was 100%, made sure there was no funny business going on. When I actually left the OG as the CEO, the net EBITDA, in that year of 2017, was around €19.2 million which, under the circumstances of changes in reimbursement, suppliers changing, bringing in new suppliers, was quite a fantastic job to bring in the other €20 million.

### This EBITDA was basically coming from Spectrum and Medilas?

Yes, the UK was bringing in about €2 million; Medilas was bringing in probably somewhere in the order of 9.2 million Swiss francs. HOLI-MED in Poland was bringing in about €1.2 million. Polytech-Domilens was bringing in somewhere around €8 million and, in terms of the others, the Spanish was losing money. It's a funny subsidiary, but there was opportunity there. If we could bring these products into Spain, we can make profit. I should also say, at that time, there were several other companies in conversation that I brought in, which was a company called NewTech in Italy. That was together with Bruno \[Molfrini 0:21:07\]. We were in provisional discussions. I've known Bruno, as of today, 42 years, and he has a very successful Italian business. Whether it's acquired or whether it's transferable, that's only something that due diligence would really tell you today.

There was a company in France which we were approaching. We were looking at them, but they were playing hard to get. There was also a packaging company, MED, which they later acquired. But in 2018, the purchase price would have been around €4 million to get it on board, and then the group messed around for 15 to 18 months, and they ended up paying €6.5 million for the same business. It was just stupid gambling. The new CEO that came in, who I'm still in touch with, and I'm still good friends with, is a gentleman called Roland Bruhin. Ro is a very decent guy. He's very skilled. He's not an ophthalmic knowledgeable professional, but he's a quick learner and he's very good on finance. Very, very good at measuring opportunities. Then things just seemed to go from bad to worse in that business. I was chairman of the group and in the end, I just threw the towel in. I'd had enough. The writing was on the wall to go left and they just seemed to go right all the time.

### When did you throw in the towel?

I threw the towel in in March of 2019.

### What happened then?

I have to be careful how I say this and phrase it. To be as straightforward as I can, they did a lot of creative accounting and they elbowed everybody out who had loans and equity. Then miraculously, within three months, AddLife had acquired it. It was something of a shock.

### When did AddLife acquire it?

It was March 2020; right at the start of Covid.

### I thought it was more recent than that. Is Roland still the CEO today?

No, he was elbowed out in 2019, and I’ve lost touch with all the names of these different people within the organization. Darius somebody or other rings a bell. The partners in Stirling Square put somebody in from private equity to oversee, basically, massive cost reductions. They were trimming everything, getting this company ready to plug it on. We knew that, but they were they were hurting it badly by doing stupid things rather than sensible things for the business. You maximize the profitability by, obviously, generating the highest level of EBITDA you can, but if during that process, you do some irreparable damage – which in my opinion, I would suggest they did – they didn't care because it was already out of their hands. If you're in AddLife, you have to pick up the pieces of what you bought and probably needed to do better due diligence on. But it was a sizable acquisition. Remember, it's around €140 million but they effectively squeezed everybody else out. There was only Stirling Square left, plus Marcus Gossi who had some senior debt in there as part of their acquisition of Medilas, and they paid him his senior debt, but the lower level of debt, which I was included in, Roland and Marcus Gossi, we were all squeezed out.

### I was just looking up when we were speaking, it was actually April 2021 that AddLife bought VOG.

I'm getting too old; so they would have gotten rid of Bruhin at the end of 2020.

### But that was before AddLife took over?

Yes, it was just before.

### But who is it that they're cutting across and increasing the EBITDA? Was that Roland or that was someone from Stirling Square Capital that was paid? What has happened to Stirling Square since the acquisition by AddLife? Do you still have any knowledge of that? Or have you lost touch?

To be totally honest, I've lost touch. There are rumors and innuendo, and there are some facts that I know.

> Essentially, the business that AddLife bought was an under-resourced, poorly invested group of distributors, where they'd lost all the senior talent. These distribution companies, the founders of those companies, that then were acquired by Stirling Square, they needed those people. This is something I fought with in the board meeting; at the board level, group level of the head of all these distribution companies, that company, their customer, was the suppliers. That table of people who had been involved in the businesses before they were acquired by Stirling Square, their customer was the supply chair. The local entities, their customers are the ophthalmologist or the surgeons, etc. Board level, it was our job to make sure the supply chain with old, existing and new technologies was secured.

For example, my situation now when working with Glaukos, I started to work in its infancy, in 2001.

> You need people at the top level that have contact to not only existing manufacturers, but emerging manufacturers; people with a great deal of experience that know which way the market is going to go, so you can be proactive when working with new technologies. You only have a lifespan with the best technologies of around three to five years because those technologies are going to be acquired by bigger companies. That's the game and that's the fun, because you make sure that those supply contracts have exit clauses in there where you get compensated. Exit clauses where you're not restricted to sell competing products, and you have a pipeline ready for when that product disappears for the next product to come in and it's probably better than the product you're losing because it's the next emerging technology.

That's the game, particularly in our distribution and supply. You've got to know where the market is going, what the market needs are going to be. You also have to separate those products. When it comes to diagnostic technology, the reimbursement is not a key issue because it's an adjunct or combination of what's already being done. It's offering more efficiency, or better image technology or better patient care. When it comes to disruptive technologies, this is where reimbursement and market access needs to be focused on together with a supplier or a future supplier. You work closely with them, not bringing the product to market until you get the reimbursement set, and then you go to market together so you share the costs.

### Is that lobbying health regulators? What does that involve?

Can be, in Germany particularly. In the UK, you can't really lobby NICE, but you can lobby expert working groups within the College of Ophthalmologists. In Switzerland, you can lobby the high level as well; you can lobby politicians particularly strongly. If you look at France, you can't lobby HAS but you can lobby the expert working group. It's not rocket science; you just have to have a well-prepared value proposition.

### This is the job of the distributor to help the OEM do this? And then VOG basically lost the people who were doing this?

They executed them. They basically knew too much, so they were out. It was very strange. They didn't compensate the people; they were really brutal in the way they handled things. To be fair, they took probably the best part of €7 million or €8 million from three of us.

### In what sense?

We had equity, but we also had loan capital in there as well and those loan notes were yielding around 11%, which was an inflated way of getting money. It's a classic trick with private equity. But if the business model was working correctly, there's no reason why that could not be honored by them, but they constructed a new organization in Luxembourg, where it's just so difficult for the likes of myself or Marcus or Roland, and some of the other managers who held shares in the business to actually fight against this situation. It was deliberately done.

### Who are the three people you mentioned? You, Roland, and who was the other guy?

Marcus Gossi. He's Swiss and he lives in Zurich.

### What was his connection?

He was the owner of Medilas in Switzerland. Really good guy.

Basically, it sounds like they napalmed the whole organization. Where does that leave it today? AddLife is obviously more of a responsible industrial owner; is there an opportunity for them to repair this damage? Or do you think it's too far gone?

Without being in the business, and looking at how they're managing the products and the pipeline, it's very difficult for me to say that they could recover it because I don't know what they're up to. But it's like any business; with the right people, we could turn this around. It's probably a three-to-five-year turnaround. If you could turn it around and turn it around nicely. It might need some further acquisitions to offer Pan European supply, which is very, very interesting to Japanese manufacturers, or Eastern manufacturers. If I was 40 years of age, and I was offered the chance to do the role, I would probably take it on but I would need to know a five-year business plan, which would require investment for the first two years, stabilization for the next two years and then growth in the fifth year. And when we got substantial growth, it would be substantial growth.

Could you describe the business and whether you think it's a good one or not? What are the main products that are distributed? Is it pretty much the same in all these overseas subsidiaries? Are there different product mixes in each subsidiary?

They are very similar products, but there are different brands. In Poland, they sell the DORC machine, which is a superb machine for retinal surgery. They don't have the luxury of having that in Germany, because it's a direct operation from DORC, because the market's bigger. If you look at the intraocular lens range, they've tried to standardize that throughout the group. That is something that I employed a lady to do, because she knew the IOL market and she started working with an Indian supplier. The Indian supplier is the largest manufacturer of IOLs, with the exception of Alcon, which is a company based in Gujarat and a fantastic product. Rebranded as a European brand, looking at the pricing available for this IOL as intraocular lens, the margins could be huge. Even at today's prices, the margins could be huge. They neglected that and decided to go with a Hungarian manufacturer, which obviously has some interesting technology, and is backed by European markets and European imagery. But if you have the right people inside the organization, you can recreate that with the Indian product. They're all compliant with the regulations; they are MDR approved; they're an excellent manufacturer. In fact, they are my support distribution company in India for Glaukos.

### So it was a mistake; they basically picked the wrong partner, then?

I don't know without looking at the margins, but to me, for the next five years, if you look at the revenue and the margin on intraocular lenses, it's going to continue to fall, and certain manufacturers are going to fall off the edge, and the whole thing is going to consolidate.

### From the perspective of a distributor like VOG, is this a good business to be in? Do they make good margins? And if so, how?

On the surface, if they're not making good margins, if their margins are not somewhere between 40% to 45% or 50%, they're not negotiating properly. I don't know the strength of their ability to negotiate. I don't know their pricing to the market anymore. I'm not in the IOL market anymore. I don't have any emotional attachment to the business whatsoever. All the people that were there when I was there, they've basically changed, so I have no emotional attachment. My suggestion would be that AddLife needs to look at this group of distributors. Look at where it is today, but decide where they want it to be five years from now. What do they need to do to get it to where they want it to be? It is very possible. Some of it, the area where they've really become weak in the UK, for example, is they didn't invest in the diagnostic equipment side. I wasn't in the company at this time, but I heard all it needed was £100,000 investment into a new range of products. That range of products is now netting the new distribution company £4 million in revenue. But on the EBITDA calculation, if you're getting 12 and you invest £100,000 in stock, then you're going to lose £1.2 million in income when you sell the business, which is sad.

### But these intraocular lenses, are they a commodity? Where is the opportunity? What is the value added by a distributor?

You have the commodity product. You should carry two levels of product, so you carry the commodity, you carry the premium. You also need the multifocal, you need toric, and you need the EDOF range of lenses. They might come from an alternative supplier and you need to spread your supply base from a branded product that you're not branding, because in the case of acquisition, these companies get the profit. If you create your own brand alongside and it becomes a trusted brand, then if you look at the supplier in India, this company is not for sale. It never will be for sale. It's an Indian company, and it's a family business so you've got secure supply of IOLs for as long as you need it.

### Basically, creating a white label own branded product is one of the key sources of profits here? You sell the commodity stuff not so much to make money, but just to get a foot through the door?

Yes, and you need another component as well. You would need a phaco multiplication machine to combine, to enable you to do what we refer to as 'bundling' where you're selling multiple products, but in most markets, that's classed as an illegal way of doing business. So you cross-sell. You don't bundle; you cross sell.

### What do you bundle?

Let's say it's a surgeon who does 1,000 procedures a year, purchases a phaco machine which is a capital outlay. Then you tie him up with all the visco, the lenses, the packs, and everything he needs for those 1,000 cases for five years, so he's locked in and you get all his business. You can have a break clause in the contract, favorable to yourself, always be able to increase the prices should inflation go nuts and so on. You can gain great business doing that.

### It sounds a bit like the pub business model where you fit out the pub for the landlord and then sell him beer for the next 20 years.

It's exactly the same.

### Which companies make phaco machines?

They lost the main phaco supplier through incompetence. The main company they had was a company called Oertli which, again, is a Swiss company. It's based in Berneck, which you probably know, up in Appenzell. It's a nice product; it's rather up-price but that's as a consequence of the exchange rates.

### Have they found a replacement? How do you sell the lenses if you're not placing the phaco machines?

There's your problem in Germany; there's your problem in Switzerland. They have some kind of court arrangement in Switzerland, but it's not a direct ownership in bundling. They make the way for the Oertli machine to be put within the hospital, and then they combine the product. It's more of a co-operation in Switzerland. Whereas in Germany, they lost the Oertli system from lack of performance. They've lost it through lack of performance in the UK as well. So they lack a phaco machine in the two key markets.

### What can they do then?

They could get the NIDEK machine. I could sit here all day telling them what they should do. There are three or four other phaco machine manufacturers, but it will take a couple of years for them to become established and recognized. You need speakers on the podium saying, "I'm using this beautiful system, I can do this technique", and people will want to see it and want to try it and they'll buy it.

### Who's distributing that NIDEK machine today? Or is it not really being sold in Europe?

It's not really being sold in Europe. There's several machines which are. If you look at what the market wants now, you determine what the customer needs and what it'd like to have, and then you fit the machine into where the market is today.

### What percentage of the business are these IOLs in combination with a phaco machine? Is that most of their business or are there other important business lines?

It's five years since I've been involved in business. I really don't know.

### Five years ago; was that the main business?

Yes.

### If they don't have a phaco machine now, that means they just have to live off the installed base? Or is the business going to go to zero? What will happen?

It'll probably bump around.

### Can you still make sales?

You can do. Where hospitals are specific and where clinics are specific to not being tied to any one manufacturer, the bundling solution is 40% of the markets and you can still do well.

### You said you said roughly 40% on the market isn't bundled? There's a big difference between 40 and 100.

There is, but if you look at the size of the market, it's still a sizable market. If you look at how many cataracts are being done it in those European countries, you're looking somewhere around three and a half million, maybe four million. If you take 40%, you could do well under that. It's a big market.

### Who are the other big players in this market on the distribution side? The phaco machine manufacturers selling the lenses directly?

The phaco machine manufacturers need a partner. They have a distribution partner in most cases, where they are an independent standalone phaco provider. If you put the phaco machines to one side, and you look at all the product offerings needed for the procedure, and phaco is just one element, you can still tie up customers with the other product offering if you have some innovative products outside of the phaco machine. You can encourage the clinic chains, so it's the Vista Clinic chain in Switzerland, or Artemis or EuroEyes. You can do a deal with them where they move the phaco machine to one side, tie up all the consumables and then they would negotiate for the phaco machine separately with two or three providers. There's ways of doing it.

### Who are the other major companies selling, distributing these IOLs?

In Germany, you have the least four other distributors, so I can give you 20 companies off the top of my head. You have several companies in the UK that are small, friendly distributors. Their revenue streams are somewhere between £2 and £5 million as a business. In the UK, maybe three, in Germany, about five. In Spain, there's one huge distributor that has done particularly well.

### VOG obviously has done £100 million in revenues or something; they're much bigger than all the other players? Or is there anyone comparable in size?

> As a group they're much, much bigger. That's their power. They're missing a trick. They could leverage their size with the manufacturer of the phaco or the manufacturer of lenses, and they can use that power to get good prices and exclusivity.

### Fascinating. How come there are so many smaller players? Is it just not a business where you necessarily need to be particularly huge?

In the past, you didn’t have to be huge, but you're having to be huge in the future, because of MDR. The Medical Device Regulations in Europe are playing into the hands of the bigger providers, because you have to do post-market surveillance for several of your products. Not every product; there are some grandfather clauses. With the key products, you have to do post market surveillance, which requires a headcount and a businessman like myself doesn't want to get involved in the administrative process of following those products. If you have one person appointed for regulatory throughout the whole group, which you could do, it's pretty straightforward to do post market vigilance. It's not the same as the pharmaceutical side but it's not as in depth, it's very straightforward. You can create a registry all the way down so easily.

### That should play into the hands of VOG?

That’s where the future is. That's the gold card; they need to use their weight. If you have a fragmented management team that just thinks down their own road, which I think is probably the case – but I'm guessing – then you'll never get a consolidated approach. In the UK, instead of having a Tesco, which is what VOG or AddLife has now become, they're acting like a group of shopkeepers.

### Within the individual countries or primarily between the different countries?

In the individual countries, they're acting like different brands of shopkeepers. They need to become aware of the fact that they are a Tesco. To be fair, from a marketing standpoint, they are branding AddLife. They are 'branding AddVision, as they call it and that's now being seen. But it's it needs a personality; it needs several personalities, at a high level, to connect with the suppliers. The board of AddLife should be the people doing that role. Leave the individual managers to manage the day-to-day business, but the board should have activities given to them to go and source new technologies, new products; that's their remit.

### Which board should be doing that?

The AddLife board. Rather than just having a board full of bean counters, you need two or three people on that board, going out there connecting with suppliers and negotiating on behalf of that group.

### Surely that's something that needs to happen within AddVision? That's where the expertise is to negotiate with suppliers. AddLife's board is generalists. Clearly, you need two or three key people having those supply discussions. But they don't have those today?

Not that I know of. I think they're still negotiating. Again, I'm guessing, but I hear on the grapevine they're still negotiating.

### With personnel to do that role or with suppliers?

Just the local managing director or general manager doing all those negotiations.

### It's trying to hire someone to do that because it's fragmented as it is. I think AddLife has now been the owner for about a year and a half, a little bit longer. Do you hear of any improvements or worsening of the situation? Or are you too far away?

My honest reaction is I'm too far away.

### That's fine. It sounds like there should be low hanging fruit in the sense that it sounds like Stirling Square really did a lot of damage to the business, which is obviously bad. But the flipside is, there should be plenty of opportunity to improve things.

Absolutely. There is no question. They need to focus on the three key areas of growth. It's not the cataract business. That's not the areas of growth. It's vitreoretinal. It's the back of the eye. It's front of the eye. It's corneal. It's corneal refractive and it's glaucoma. That's where they need to be. Yes, you need to be the cataract business and you will get cataract business, on the back of the fact that you're bringing something special.

### The cataract is basically commoditized?

I'll give you a tip. My focus five years ago was because of the introduction of a technique called SLT, which is when a patient presents with glaucoma at the clinic. Instead of putting them on drops, you do SLT, which perforates a particular structure in the eye, which reduces the pressure. This lasts about one and a half to two years and requires an SLT laser to do this. The uptake of SLT lasers in the last three years has been something like a growth in the market of 600%. This is where the £100,000 investments in the UK was turned down. Just dumbass behavior. It's frustrating.

### Frankly, I hate to see when companies buy companies from private equity, because you always hear similar stories. I don't know why no one ever learns.

Yes, and the multiples they pay, my God, they're off the planet. But this will come tumbling down at some point, because if you look at what's been going on recently in the medical area of private equity, it seems that the funds were there for a five year fund. Somewhere around year four, everybody starts swapping assets. The waste at that time, and the trading that goes on between these private equity houses is quite ridiculous.

### I think we're out of time. I really appreciate your honesty and openness. As a shareholder for AddLife, I'm sorry hear that it sounds like they didn't buy a great asset, but I'm encouraged that it sounds as if, fundamentally, it's a good business and there's maybe an opportunity to get it back to where it needs to be.
