### Pat, what was the original thinking around executive membership at Costco?

Costco is a membership organization at heart. They were trying to both solidify and create an even stickier relationship with its most valuable members such as the volume shoppers, businesses that buy many products annually, as well as individuals who are heavy shoppers.

Prior to the executive membership there was individual and business, and the executive membership applies to both. Some benefits were for individuals in their personal lives and some were for businesses, but both solidified the relationship with volume shoppers.

### How did you think about which services to launch, to add additional value to that target group?

We looked at a collection of both individual and business services. Everything Costco does is not about how much money they can make on services, but more about how much value those services could create.Costco is not afraid to do things differently, looking at where there was an inefficient market and where they could help deliver savings. An example is businesses that take credit cards. Keep in mind, most Costco businesses are small businesses. Back when Costco offered a credit card service, the people who offered them were very inefficient with their black box pricing and complicated grid matrix. There were even resellers who would go off and mark up the service and then resell it through a small business.

It was an inefficient market with very high margins. Costco realized if you strip out all the marketing costs and inefficient middlemen, businesses were being overcharged for credit card processing. We worked with the largest credit card processor in North America to create a very simple pricing strategy of one price. At that time, you were paying 4% to 5% for credit card processing and we charged 1.99% which represented a huge savings to those businesses. If all they did was use the credit card processing service at Costco, the average business paid for their executive membership four or five times over. Those were the kind of services we wanted to deliver. In some cases, we would see there was not much value to add, and would not offer them.

### Is Costco's credit card offer still attractive given all the payment solutions?

Costco compressed the mark-ups in that business, which upset the entire industry, to the benefit of small merchants, but there is still benefit. Costco removes all marketing costs for that credit card services provider and do not take any mark-up themselves. They always offer value because they look to strip costs out of the system and pass those savings on.

### What was the adoption rate for services in the executive membership?

It was surprisingly high, quite quickly. In 24 months, Costco had a $1 billion merchant portfolio. Today, I would think it was a multiple of that.

### Did you add the 2% reward immediately on the launch of the Executive membership?

No, that came about a year into it, and was the cherry on top of the sundae. Once the executive membership was working and we saw the impact it was having, the 2% rebate was an ultimate add on. At that point, it made the math easy for a member who purchased more than a certain amount from Costco every year, to use the 2% rebate. People were asking why we were giving that away. We found that volume shoppers were cherry picking Costco versus alternatives like Sam's Club, and would split their purchases. The rebate incentivized them to drive all their purchases to Costco, which again locked up the most valuable members.

### How does Costco's reward system compare to Sam's Club or BJs or any other offering that they have for high-volume shoppers?

The average Costco location did double the sales of their competition, on a per store basis. We had substantially more members and could drive more volume to the providers. Whether it was auto insurance or credit card processing, we could deliver more volume and command better value than our competition could.

### Is that the same with services?

It is exactly the same. When you buy a jar of mayonnaise, you know the cost and it is very clear how much savings you offer versus a typical retailer. Whereas when you buy a service, things are a little squishier. That was a unique challenge because if Costco cannot offer the lowest price, they simply will not offer it.

### You have to build trust with that member?

Correct.

### When you added the 2% reward to the exec membership, did members change their behavior towards shopping with other clubs more than at Costco?

The average annual purchases of those members went up. Not only did it divert sales from direct competitors like Sam's Club; it diverted purchases from other trade channels because they wanted the 2% rebate, which applied to gasoline and everything in a warehouse.

### Don’t Sam's Club offer a cashback reward, similar to that of Costco?

They do, but I do not know what their current offering is.

### I think they give 3% cashback at Sam's Club; 5% on gas up to $6,000 per year, then 1% after that. 3% on dine-in and 1% on other purchases, so it is much more complicated.

Yes, I have not kept track of how they changed it over time, but a year after we did this, they tried to offer many similar things.

### How would an auto insurer strike a deal with Costco to offer services for the exec members, for example?

That was the biggest limiting factor because Costco was not interested in a simple 5% discount. Service providers would lay out their cost structure and partner with Costco, to deliver the most effective package possible for their members. If they had 15% marketing cost, Costco would strip out that and other unnecessary costs and create a unique service offering with the same or better service than what that service provider offers today.

Some service providers, even though their profit might stay the same, were not willing to offer a lower a price out of fear that it would disrupt their pricing policy, and in that case, Costco simply would not work with them. That was the biggest difference between Costco services and what other retailers were doing, such as simply choosing the quick and easy, 5% or 10% off if you were a member with them.

### So Costco would market the services internally to their members, strip out the cost from the carrier or insurer, thereby offering a lower price for their customers?

Exactly, and marketing was only one example. They looked at the whole cost structure to strip out any unnecessary costs. It required an understanding of that service industry and therefore took us a while to develop the right service bundle. It also created more competitive distance between us and our competition.

### Why do other retailers or clubs not follow a similar strategy as Costco?

They think they do by offering a 5% discount off the top, but it does not get you to the same place. Small regional retailers simply cannot deliver millions of customers and will never have the same negotiating leverage.

### So it’s a mix between the scale per service or SKU and Costco’s philosophy around having deep discounts, rather than the easy option of a 5% or 10% off?

Correct.

### So if Costco sends a lead to Progressive, do they not get a lead generation fee?

That is right, because if you did that, the insurer would build that into their cost. The costs have to go somewhere, and as a membership organization, Costco do not worry about making a profit on the service. It simply enhances the value of the membership. That is the biggest fundamental difference between Costco and other retailers, regardless of whether it be services, merchandise or gasoline.

### How do Costco work with service partners to add more value to the customer?

For every service Costco offer, they evaluated 10 who did not make the cut. They constantly evaluate opportunities and only approve those which meet strict guidelines. They will also closely monitor service levels and cut off service providers who are not excellent. It is not only about the price of the service, but the quality of service, as well.

### How does Costco's approach to services differ from products?

At first, there was an assumption it was the same, but it isn’t; services are squishy. Auto insurers differ in the way they define pricing territories. Costco had to feel comfortable that the majority of the time they would be the lowest cost service. If the nature of the service was so squishy in its pricing that it was not consistently low enough, they simply would not get into that service. It is tougher to get a service approved at Costco compared to a typical company who simply look at how much money they could make by reselling the service.

### If there is dynamic pricing in the service or it is very complex it becomes difficult to guarantee the value to customers, what variables do you look at?

You have to assess how often that service will be the low cost and by how much. Auto insurance is a great example. I remember we had to do a lot of work to satisfy ourselves that 90% of the time we would be, apples to apples, the low cost. The specifics depend on the industry but it is much trickier on a service than it is with a product.

### When you launched the product, what was the pricing between the first tier and the executive membership?

Executive membership was $100, business was $40 and individual was $60.

### And this was 20 odd years ago?

Correct.

### And the current price $60 for standard and $120 for executive?

I know the executive membership is $120.

### So the executive membership has only moved by $20 over 20 years?

Costco increase their membership fees gradually; they are very careful about that.

### How did you arrive at the figure of $100 for the executive membership?

It was a little bit of art and a little bit of science. Looking at the price spread against existing memberships, there is a question of price resistance; at what point is the increase too big? We also looked at the amount of savings we thought we could generate to an average member, and give a return on that. If you only saved them $50, they probably would not sign up for a $100 membership. We looked at the bundle of services and thought the average member would save $300 to $400. That sounds like a good return for somebody to take a chance on.

### Even now you have the 2% rewards; it’s even more of a no-brainer. I know this is not how Costco thinks, but the value of membership is high relative to price. Could there be potential price increases to the executive membership?

They would never independently move executive membership fees. Every five or seven years, they look at membership fees and move them together.

### Is it underpriced?

For certain members it is, which is to their benefit because they are volume shoppers, which is the logic behind the whole thing. It behooves Costco to solidify their relationship with volume shoppers who buy $10,000 a year as opposed to normal Costco shoppers who only buy $1,000 a year. They also have to ensure those shoppers do not shop elsewhere, so they will not over think the price of the executive membership.

### Is it all about driving sales through boxes?

The more you can drive through, the higher the operating leverage.

### What is the incremental cost of adding new services given you do not sell them but simply employ a team of marketers or business development executives?

There is fixed overhead of an internal business development team who evaluates those, and minimal incremental variable costs of preparing some point of purchase materials. Marketing depends on the kind of service and how you go to that, but there are some costs. That allows Costco to strip so much cost out of those services.

### Do you share that marketing cost with an auto insurer, for example?

Each relationship is different. Usually not. When I was at Costco, we were careful not to burden our members with too much marketing. It was a membership organization and we did not want to turn our mailing lists over to third party service providers. We took care of that ourselves and the mailing list was a closely guarded asset.

### How could Costco further grow their executive membership base?

As Costco grow, they need to look at a combination of different services, because services come and go. When I started executive membership, long distance phone service was a real thing. Today it is free so it has become irrelevant. They need to constantly re-evaluate where people spend the bulk of their money and where Costco could generate savings. The other thing that comes into play is offering unique hours for executive members. Business members used to be able to get in an hour early to buy for their restaurants without the crowds.

### I think 40% of executive members drive over 50% of the volume. Is there a ceiling for executive membership penetration of the total membership base?

I have no hard numbers but it depends on the offering they have at a given time. They are currently close to that ceiling, but they could come out with something which strips a huge amount of cost out of a service we all use in our daily lives. That could have a step change impact on their penetration of executive membership.

### As they continually improve the offering, could we reach a 55% penetration?

Correct. Given they do not simply look for easy discounts but understand and break down the cost of service delivery, Costco are uniquely positioned to unlock value before others can.

### Does that differentiate Costco enough so they could they win the customer for life?

Yes, and you just got at the whole purpose of the executive membership. The average volume of a Sam's Club or BJs compared to that of Costco over the past 20 years, the distance has grown continuously, which is sure to win those customers for life.

### It almost fuels itself; sales per box increases as the exec membership does. What services could Costco add to improve their current offering? Is it more difficult to add value relative to the past, given the acceleration of technology innovation?

The acceleration in technology creates an opportunity for Costco to add value. Those opportunities do not go away but simply change in terms of where you can find them. Where an individual spends money on services today is different than it was 10 to 15 years ago. That is what the Costco business development people do because it is still in Costco's DNA. Historically, they have experimented with new businesses and if they don't work, they get out. Costco have opened gyms, home improvement stores and many other crazy things.

As long as they are adding value, they are not afraid to try, and if it fails, they stop. That relentless entrepreneurial spirit is very unique for a company as large as Costco, because usually when companies grow, they get more structured and lose that entrepreneurial edge.

### What sticks the entrepreneurial spirit together and keeps that core to Costco?

In one word, culture. The original two founding business partners, Jeffrey Brotman and Jim Sinegal, were still running the business up until fairly recently. Two people effectively ran the company with an entrepreneurial mindset by very clearly distilling that culture. Some retailers change executives and strategy every year whereas Costco never changes strategy. I have been away from Costco for a long time and guarantee that the culture is still 99% intact. Even with succession, management live and breathe that culture with a very clear mindset.

### What makes Jim Sinegal unique?

There are many things. He is a very astute businessman and an entrepreneur at heart. He has a way of distilling down the most important things and clearly communicating those throughout a huge organization. He was always good at repeating the core values of the company and what the key business objectives were in any given year. It was impossible to be unclear what those objectives were because he kept it simple and avoided the temptation of complications and distraction. That sounds easy but it is very hard to do when you scale into hundreds of billions of revenue. I work with many companies of different sizes and very few have the clarity and simplicity of mission that Costco has, where all employees understand it.

### How did he instill the entrepreneurial spirit into employees, of testing gyms, home improvement stores or new services?

There were business development employees who evaluated those things. I was in that group for a long time. Whether the ideas came from Jim or others, he would personally evaluate these new opportunities. Think about a company of that scale, with the CEO sitting down and meeting one-on-one with the business development person, who would open a single health club in Portland, Oregon, to understand the P&L. He had the capacity and memory to grasp more than most humans I have ever met. He could pivot from that discussion about a single health club, to Wall Street quarterly earnings.

### Can you share some context to the rationale of the gas station business?

Jim Sinegal and others thought about the gasoline business while at Fedmart, which was a retailer in the 70s that many of the Costco senior management had come from. It was one of many things they tasked the business development team to investigate. I was asked to look at the gas and the logic was simple. When you think about readily recognizable value, there is not much, other than a gallon of milk, that people know the cost of as much as fuel.

There was a perception of high price sensitivity on the part of Costco members. Many people do not realize that the objective was not to be the world's biggest gas marketer and to make a fortune by selling gas. The goal, just like the executive membership, was if you could deliver enough value in gas, you could also increase shopper frequency. At the time we did the gas station, the average Costco member shopped every two and a half to three weeks, but would buy gas more frequently than that. They would come in and also visit and shop inside the club. The impact it could have on the in-warehouse sales was the indirect strategic goal.

We were able to deliver 10 to 15 cents a gallon and often times more in savings. That drove in-warehouse sales by 3%. An average club was doing $150 million in revenue, so adding 3% of incremental sales was very profitable sales inside the club.

### How did you approach sourcing the fuel?

Upon research we convinced ourselves that, at least in the United States, all fuel from major oil refiners was essentially the same. Federal mandates dictate gas quality and which additives were in the gas, so whether you bought from Shell or Chevron's refinery, it made no difference. There was a white label market where those refiners sold the same gas which went into their own branded stations, to other users. We tapped into that wholesale market and I was surprised because I assumed the major oil companies would try to squish us like a bug in the beginning, but they did not. They let competition play out and once we got to a certain size, we sourced fuel through contracts because Costco was a large purchaser of fuel.

### How were you cheaper than the big players if you purchased a low volume?

Same Costco approach. We didn’t just open a gas station; we reimagined the gas station to strip out all the costs. There are three grades of fuel in the USA but your car only needs two of them, so we channeled our purchasing into those two grades of fuel. Instead of an attendant, we used pay-at-the-pump technology. Costco already owned its own land so did not need to buy land for a gas station. We also did not require a fancy gas station; a simple canopy would suffice. Once you strip out all these costs, Costco had a gas station with a much lower operating cost than a typical gas station.

### And these stations also had no shop at the pump? Did you have to get your fuel, then drive to the warehouse car park, then go into the warehouse to spend in store?

Correct. Even things as little as not having a squeegee to clean your windows. I remember being yelled at for even suggesting we do that, because it is one more thing you have to buy and maintain. All members cared about, was getting quality fuel at a low price.

### I can imagine Jim shouting when you suggested incremental complexity or cost.

Yes, that happened often, and there was a similar episode when the CFO of Costco suggested they raise the price of their famous $1.50 hot dogs to $1.75

### There is a famous quote.

It is true though.

### How did you think about pricing the fuel and what gross margin did you look to achieve?

We looked at the required gross margin to cover costs and have a modest margin. Costco is public and, if you look at their Wall Street filings, they never mark up more than 13%. We took a similar approach and were banking on the fact that if we did enough volume, we would cover those operating costs. If we only did $1 million a year out of the gas station, 13% margin would not be enough to cover those operating costs, but we priced it as if we were going to do those volumes. That was one of the few times in my career where the volumes came out substantially higher than we had estimated. You get a lot of fixed overhead coverage when you sell $1 million every few weeks as opposed to $1 million a year from a gas station.

### Why do you think it surpassed your volume expectations?

I assumed no one would be willing to wait more than three cars deep for gas. I figured that it was great to save 10 cents but that no one would wait 20 minutes for gas. That was the biggest error in my assumptions. A typical Costco gas station had very deep lines. People are willing to wait to save money on gas because they are very price sensitive to fuel.

### I cannot understand that.

It defies all logic.

### Why do people queue so long for gas?

It gets back to that notion of readily recognizable value. You could show me an electronic item at a great price, but I would have to research it to understand it's a great price. However, when I look at the price of fuel, I know immediately if that is a good price. When we survey people, gas is one of the top five things they know the price of without having to check.

### How did you look at the volatility in the profitability of the gas station given that it is ultimately a commodity? Is there a risk that Costco could lose money for longer periods of time through their gas stations?

Yes, there is because of the way that large branded gas retailers work. They offer zone pricing whereas Costco simply looked at the costs and marked it up this much. There were times where Costco could be in a tough spot margin wise, but they were not worried if they did not make money this month, because they looked at it over the course of a year. Costco went through its fuel so fast that, in a declining price market, they tended to do quite well because they would be into the lower cost fuel faster than a typical gas station would.

Conversely, when prices dramatically went up, they would incur those high costs faster than a smaller gas station, who only fill their tanks every few weeks. It swings both ways and they looked at it on an annual basis. But over time, that volatility has been lessened because they are such a large fuel purchaser and buy on contracts similar to the larger players.

### How do branded suppliers compete with Costco on a price point?

I never understood their approach, nor did I ever speak to them so I do not know. Major oil companies realized their value add was more upstream in oil processing as opposed to the retail business.

### They’ve been selling them off. Even in Europe, they have been selling all the gas stations off to private equity.

Yes, for years oil companies auctioned off 1,000 of gas stations because they made so much money further upstream and opted to focus on that instead. It worked out to Costco's benefit, but it always surprised me that they took that approach.

### Gas accounts for 9% of sales which is high for a low margin product. If this gets to 10% or 15% of sales, how do you think that will change the dynamics for Costco?

I don’t. Here’s why; Costco make almost no money before membership fees. They make their money on membership fees, so if you add value, you give yourself the ability to increase your membership fees over time and retain and grow your profitability. The flip side is you will get incremental profit from driving more sales through the fixed cost of that warehouse. The more people buy fuel at Costco, the more they buy from the warehouse. You do not need to make much on gas to drive the same kind of incremental profit as you would by growing other parts of the business at Costco.

### If gas made up 20% of sales, given the volatility of the underlying product of gas, is there a risk we could see a large hit to earnings or profitability for Costco?

Some commodities you cannot hedge and there is a lot of risk, but this is a commodity you can hedge. When it is 9% of sales, I would be willing to guarantee they are hedging. They give up some upside to prevent a disaster on the down side.

### In their recent earnings, Richard Galanti said the gas business was becoming more consistently profitable, given the scale and less competition with brands selling off their stations. Do you see scale driving more consistency in profitability and cheaper pricing because you buy so much more fuel?

It is no different from a box of crackers you buy inside the warehouse. The more scale and fixed cost leverage, the better the buying and higher the net margins.

### Did a different type of customer sign up when you added gas stations?

It did provide a bump in membership to a given warehouse when it would offer gas, but I do not know if the profile of that member was different than the existing ones.

### More self-employed people or those who drive for part of their living? I would assume it was an attractive customer acquisition tool?

There was a certain element of that, but it was outweighed by the percentage of the population who are very sensitive to the price of fuel. I don't change gas stations for 5 cents but many people would for a penny. Those people were disproportionately attracted.

### Do Costco even want to address the gas queues?

They think about that no differently than the way they do inside the warehouse. They manage those queues by simplifying the operation to allow for speed and throughput. We designed hoses in the gas station that were extra long, so that if the only spot in the queue that was available was the wrong side for the filling of your vehicle, this extra long hose could reach around and grab it anyway. That speeds people through the process and it all became about speed and efficiency. They made changes over time, improving upon the original offering to make it simpler and faster. They now have attendants who never used to be there. They want to ensure you can use the automated payment system instead of wasting time.

### Was there a fixed maximum gross margin for fuel, like 14%, or was it lower?

There was. It was no different from other merchandise and a benefit of Jim Sinegal's philosophy. They would never go above a certain margin and simply pass savings along to the member. That is why at times you could see a difference in price of up to 30 cents a gallon.

### Would Jim Sinegal monitor gross margin per SKU or category to ensure no one was going above 14%?

Yes, a report would automatically calculate anything above that margin ceiling, and would go on his desk. Let me tell you, after doing it once, nobody ever did it again.

### Did you ever go over the margin cap?

No, that policy was in place long before I started the gas station; it was very clear. That is a list you do not want to be on. Most companies you get into trouble if you do not make enough margin, but at Costco you could get into trouble if you make too much.

### What is unique about the gas station business for Costco and how would you compare that ancillary to services?

One is a product and one is a service, but they are exactly the same. In the case of services against gas station, instead of simply dropping in a gas station with a convenience store, copying everybody else, and charging slightly less; it was a rethink from the ground up. Every single built in, cost and assumption, to maximize savings. That is the same thought process with services, private label food and non-food items in the warehouse.

### I want to discussing selling products into Costco now. How did you get Popchips into Costco?

Having been at Costco for a decade and starting many new businesses I was bitten by the entrepreneur bug and felt the need to start something. The hardest life decision I made was leaving Costco because it is such an amazing company. I had an idea back in 2003, when the health and snacking space was new and saw an opportunity for better food products, if they could taste good. It is easy to make a healthy product but hard to make it taste good. Keith Belling and I founded the company and thought that once we reached a certain point we would go to Costco, but their entrepreneurial buyers were looking for new things.

Within 60 days of launching, a Costco buyer had already reached out to us. That was surprising because we were so new and unproven, and did not feel ready for them. We thought we were at least a year away. We worked with them on a small scale and did a test which went well, which led to expansion. Our challenge at the time was capacity. Popchips is unique in the snack food industry. We had to build capacity which took time to source new equipment. We had to balance out Costco's needs versus other retailers, but the long and short of it was that Costco saw we were solving a real consumer need.

We had a great tasting snack with half the fat and calories of their normal chips. Having worked for Costco did me no favors; I still got beaten up over pricing and cost. I had the benefit of knowing how they think, which was to strip out every unnecessary cost, while delivering the best value. We had to develop the right size bigger bag to optimize efficiencies that would give Costco a lower cost, but not so big that newcomers were afraid to buy it. They are willing to buy a small 1 oz bag of anything, whereas a giant 18 oz bag is a different story. We had to test different flavors to see which resonated with their members. We quickly landed on the right program and got Popchips into Costco's other regions in North America.

### Costco need to buy a certain volume to stock their store so did you go one store at a time after a buyer found you and bought two pallets to test in that store?

Tests will be between six and 20 locations, but once you pass the test, they will buy in truck load quantities. It is more efficient if they buy bigger bags with less packaging cost per unit. All those efficiencies allow manufacturers to offer lower prices and still make money.

### How did the Costco buying group grill you?

The very first question out of their mouth is, what is your number one seller? They don't want a range of products; they want the number one seller.

### You were only 60 days in though, so what did you say?

Their buyer understood where we were. Many brands make the mistake of not being up front and honest with Costco, because they know how to partner with brands. Their next question was, what is the lowest cost you offer anyone? They do not care what our SRP or average cost is.

### Does Costco contractually ensure that they will get the lowest price or do they simply trust you that you are giving the right answers there?

It is more trust but they do their own due diligence. If I say my lowest cost to somebody is $5 a unit, they know where to shop and who tends to get lower costs. They would walk into a Walmart, see something and do the math and realize Walmart would not mark this up 3%, therefore these guys are giving them a lower cost and they would tell me. Then you are in trouble and will never do business with them again. It is not contractual but they do their homework, so it is best to be up front in these conversations. Sometimes you reach a fork in the road because their starting point is a minimum 20% value to cost.

If you are close, at 18% value to cost versus the lowest cost alternative you sell to, if they want the item, they will work with you and you can begin getting creative. Some of their ideas helped me take cost out of my system. While Costco got the benefit of that, as the manufacturer, I got the benefit from every other customer I sold to. If you look at it the right way and partner with them, they can really help you strip costs out of your system.

### What did you mean by 18% of value to cost?

Their second question is what is the lowest cost you sell to anyone? Your offer on a per ounce basis needs to be at least 20% lower cost to Costco than you sell to anyone else.

### Is 20% the minimum they look for?

Minimum.

### But when you work together you can reduce that even further?

Correct.

### So as a brand, you benefit from the lower unit cost, charge a higher price through other retailers which improves your margin?

Correct.

### So that was their second question; did they grill you on anything else?

They do not want to be over 20% of your sales because they are in the treasure hunt business. They do not want to put you out of business if they get out of you, so if you are smaller, you have to take it a step at a time. Instead of going national with Costco, maybe you can only be in one or two regions, and as your sales grow, you can expand to more regions.

### Is Popchips still in Costco today nationally or only in certain regions?

It’s rotated because most snacks are rotated in and out. They keep that treasure hunt mentality. They only have 15 pallet positions for snacks, some of which will be top Frito-Lay items. That leaves 10 spots to rotate things in and out, and their goal is to have the best things available to their members. There is seasonality; certain things you would offer in the summer are different from winter. The treasure hunt mentality makes you think, if I do not buy it now, it will not be there next time. If you have not been to Costco in a month, you will wonder what is new and different.

### How does that treasure hunt strategy impact brands and suppliers, because it’s more volatile for the brands?

Big national brands dislike that, but small brands get exposed to millions of Costco shoppers who know that item will soon be gone, so they will look for it in local grocery stores. That benefits the brand and grocery stores, so as a smaller brand, I have no problem with that.

### Did you ever worry about Costco launching a Kirkland Popchips competitor?

Once you get $20 million in Costco sales, you are on their radar for private label.

### Is that $20 million per SKU, nationally?

Globally.

### That is not that much?

They might have increased that over time; that was a figure about 10 years ago. It is always a risk because those are the rules of the game. Any grocery retailer could also do it.

### Can Popchips contractually agree that Costco never launch a Kirkland?

They would never contractually agree to that. Our best defense was that our brand was associated with the category and we had a top-quality product. We were convinced Costco would have a hard time finding someone else who could match or improve our quality. Costco will never launch an inferior product whereas other retailers do. We also had a secret sauce in our process being slightly different from others, so that gave us some insurance.

### How do you look at that relationship between the brand supplier and Costco launching private label Kirkland products to directly compete with the national brands?

Every company will be different. Frito-Lay would probably not do a private label. It could be a way of getting more utilization out of a factory, which lowers operating costs and increases margins on branded goods. The biggest private label trade show in North America is called the PLMA, Private Label Manufacturer's Association, and when I would walk that show, I would find some people who were offering capacity in a brand for that very reason. They have some capacity and want to utilize it, so will make a private label product for anybody. It didn't matter whether it was Costco or Kirkland.

Manufacturers of brands are usually very clear where they are at any given point of time and whether they are open to private label or not. When they do look to private label, they will avoid things which eat at their core brand equity, but still allow them to make money.

### Do the other clubs have a similar strategy of private label as Kirkland and leveraging the bargaining power over brands?

Sam's Club have a significant private label business, and so do the other clubs.

### Is there any material difference in their strategies? Kirkland is at $25 billion.

Yes, it is a big number. The biggest difference is the end game and private label is higher margin for many retailers, so they want more of their products to be private label. Costco has a target cap of 25% of sales because they still want that interplay of brands. If it was driven by how they can make the most money, it would be much higher than 25%. They have no confusion over the fact that they make money from membership.

### It goes back to how much value they can add instead of profits?

Correct, and at certain places it drives you to a different conclusion versus another retailer on any given private label opportunity.

### What is the biggest challenge for a brand to get their product into Costco?

The biggest challenge is thinking that you can bring what you do in conventional retail to Costco, because often times the packaging requirements are different. The packaging has to be the silent salesman because there is no marketing at Costco. You also have to make it worth Costco's interests with their value to cost. The process of thinking through your offer to Costco and presenting it correctly is the biggest hurdle brands have to get over. They are better off waiting until they can get their offer right, than rushing and getting a quick no.

### How do you think Costco's model translates to ecommerce?

I'm not as knowledgeable about Costco's ecommerce process, so I will offer you my opinion without any inside knowledge. For a long time, Costco looked at it as an extension of their business, whereas Walmart put more resources in developing their online businesses. It will be interesting over the coming decades to see how Costco evolves its ecommerce business. For a long time, the Costco warehouse was the dog and the online business was the tail, whereas Walmart would answer that question very differently on ecommerce and view them equally. Ecommerce is becoming more pervasive and, if Costco want to retain members of younger generations, they will have to place a bigger emphasis on it than they do today.

### Are the younger generations not as attracted to Costco as the older ones?

If there’s one thing that I’ve seen over and over again is, Costco always questions itself and tinkers and toys with things to evolve. If they don’t evolve, there is the risk. Do I think Costco will evolve? Absolutely. The question is, will they evolve in the right way to continue appeal to another generation?
