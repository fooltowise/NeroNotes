One of the fundamental laws of physics is the law of conservation of energy.
It has so far never been proved wrong, hence the term "law".

It states that there is a certain quantity, called _energy_, that stays the same in nature whatever happens.
In the case of a close system, the only difference in energy over time are the inflow and outflows of energy coming from interactions of the closed system with the external world.

Energy is a purely mathematical concept, we do not know how to explain it nor where it comes from.

Energy can take several forms:
- gravitational potential energy
- kinetic energy
- potential electric energy
- heat
- nuclear energy
- â€¦

However, if we sum up all the forms available in the system, the total energy stays constant, and this independently of how the system behaves.
