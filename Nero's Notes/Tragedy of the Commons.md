## Description:

When there is a shared mutual resource, every user benefits directly from its use, but shares the cost of its abuse with the rest of the world. That's why there is a very weak feedback loop between the condition of the resource and the users' decisions.

The consequence is an overuse of the resource, depleting it until it becomes unavailable for everybody.

## Solution:
Educate users so they understand the consequences of abusing the resource. Restore and reinforce the missing feedback loop, either by privatizing the resource so that everybody feels the direct consequences of abuse, or (because many resources cannot be privatized) by regulating for all users the access to the resource.
