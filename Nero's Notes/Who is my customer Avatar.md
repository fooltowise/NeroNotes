# Who is my customer Avatar?

1.  **Demographic traits**: List out your avatar's demographic traits (e.g., age, sex, education level, income level, marital status, occupation, religion, and average family size). 

2.  **[Psychographic traits](https://keap.com/business-success-blog/marketing/email-marketing/why-psychographic-segmentation-is-important)**:They're based on values, attitudes, interests, and lifestyle. Examples include: wanting a healthy lifestyle, valuing time with family, using Pinterest to do home DIY projects.

3.  **Name your avatar**: Naming your avatar humanises the profile. If you are targeting both men and women, you'll want to create a male and female name. Sup Jane or Joe. 

4.  **Put a face to their name**: Find a picture online, I like to pick a celebrity and go from there.

5.  **Design a dossier**: A dossier is a one-page collection of information about your avatar that includes its name, picture, information, and story.

6.  **Speaking of story**: Write one about your customer avatar. Imagine you are your avatar and are journaling about the discovery of your product or service. What were they thinking before they bought your product? How were they feeling? Why were they feeling that way? What were they looking for? What were they hoping to solve or accomplish? How did they find you or hear about you? How did they feel once they purchased your product or service? This part is actually fun and useful. 

**Let's do this.**

Meet Marc. 

Marc is between 30 and 40, male, and received a higher education. 

He is married with one or two children. Both parents work and earn between $50'000 and  $100'000. 

They saved some money that they would like to invest, but they don't know how to do it. 

They have heard about the stock market, but the available information on the Internet is so confusing - especially on the French side of the Internet! 

Marc would like to understand what to look for in an investment, and what would be the good questions to ask before making the leap. 

But financial outlets are only talking about daily market moves and "tips", and very few talk about thinking from first principle to have a solid understanding of how it works.
