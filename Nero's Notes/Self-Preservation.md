# Self-Preservation
Self-preservation is a core instinct that explains many of our actions including why we are highly sensitive to situations of scarcity, why we try to increase our value at the expense of our organization, and why we make sacrifices to ensure legacy.

Our notions of self-preservation are tied into our identities and a way to give meaning to our lives. 

If my children or my ideas survive, grow, and multiply, I have, in a sense, preserved myself.
