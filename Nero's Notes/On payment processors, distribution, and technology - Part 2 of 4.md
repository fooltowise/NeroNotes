# On payment processors, distribution, and technology: Part 2 of 4

by [[Scuttleblurb]]


In the payments space, the difference between a distributor and a competitor can be so blurry as to lose functional meaning. Mercury Payment was a significant ISO for legacy acquirers before Vantiv acquired it from Silver Lake.  Stripe offers many of the same services as the legacy acquirers to whom it outsources transaction processing.  Ditto for Square, who processes to Wells Fargo Merchant Services, a JV between Wells Fargo and First Data, even as it competes with Clover, First Data’s single most promising growth vector.  Demarcations within the value chain were bound to fade as legacy acquirers, to escape commodification, have been layering services atop transaction processing for decades. 

Total Systems Services, which spun-off of regional lender Synovus Financial in 2007, was a notable laggard in this regard.  Prior to 2009, TSYS was just a wholesale merchant processor, meaning it handled the commodity transaction processing on behalf of acquiring banks, merchant acquirers, and ISOs who took on the more value-added jobs like merchant underwriting and onboarding, fraud detection, reporting, authorization, etc.  It was the only major third party pure-play processor at a time when processing prices were eroding and its customers (full-service merchant acquirers) were consolidating.  So it came as little surprise when TSYS vertically integrated into merchant acquiring, first through its acquisition of First National of Omaha’s merchant services unit and a year later through its purchase of TermNet(1).

By 2012, Total Systems was the 16<sup>th</sup> largest acquirer in the US, focused mostly on small/mid-sized merchants.  But it wanted more.  TSYS balked at Vantiv’s acquisition of Mercury as being too expensive at mid-teens x EBITDA, but then just a few years later, perhaps sensing it was being left in the dust by peers who were throwing billions at integrated payments and omni-channel acceptance, paid 16x EBITDA Cayan ($1.1bn) and Transfast ($2.4bn), the two largest acquisitions in the company’s history.  Besides opening a new distribution channel, these deals more than doubled TSYS’ volumes and diluted the company’s exposure to wholesale processing, which in 2015 still accounted for ~40% of its merchant services revenue. 

Vantiv, another US merchant acquirer, also transformed itself through a Cambrian explosion of acquisitions that carried it away from traditional bank and ISO distribution and towards growthier domains like e-commerce and integrated payments.  As the merchant acquiring unit of Fifth Third Bank, Vantiv mainly catered to the top 100 US retailers – department stores like Macy’s and grocers like Kroger.  Whatever SME business it had was largely confined to the mid-west.  But then Advent International bought 51% of the company in 2009 and IPO’ed it three years later.  Vantiv began to take advantage of its independence, securing SME referrals with merchant banks it had been barred from selling through when it was wholly owned by Fifth Third, and acquiring a series of integrated payments and e-commerce companies starting around 2012/2013(2).

Two acquisitions are worth pointing out: Vantiv’s $1.9bn acquisition of Mercury Payment Systems in 2014 and its $12bn merger with Worldpay in 2017.

Mercury was different from other merchant acquirers in that its approach to the market, right from the start, was to embed its payments into third party software used by SMBs.  The company’s conceit was that its payments technology could function as the key integration point between developers and dealers who were mostly focused on creating and selling point-of-sale software and did not have the expertise or the will to handle all the gritty regulatory and service demands surrounding payments.  The company insisted that its distribution network enjoyed a network effect (page 105 of Mercury’s S-1):

I read this many times and still don’t know understand it.  Maybe they just mean something like “developers make our payment solutions more valuable to our dealers and our dealers offer a monetization path for developers”?(3)  The S-1 excerpt basically describes a web of referrals between developers and dealers, held together by recurring commissions paid by Mercury to both sides.  But ok.  Let’s just say they built a great channel over the years in exactly in the channel Vantiv was looking to expand in.  After growing transactions 57% annually on an organic basis, Mercury went from the 45<sup>th</sup> largest US merchant acquirer in 2004, 3 years after it was founded, to the 11<sup>th</sup> largest by the it was acquired by Vantiv. 

Worldpay was a merger of near-equals, with Vantiv emerging as the surviving entity and the combined company taking the Worldpay name, appropriately reflecting the global reach of the combined company(4).

At the time, Vantiv, whose merchant acquiring activities were entirely relegated to the US, was having trouble capturing the overseas volumes of its large US-based clients.  Worldpay, the #1 merchant acquirer in the UK, thanks to its legacy ownership by RBS, was a major player in international e-commerce, supporting 300 different payment methods in 146 countries and 126 different currencies(5).  But it was a sub-scale player in the US, where Vantiv had a much better product suite.  By merging, each company could cross-sell services into the other and the combined company could function as a single “omni-channel” platform for multinationals, offering physical, online, and mobile acceptance almost anywhere in the world. 

Today, “global omnichannel” is Worldpay’s chief differentiating value proposition.  There are basically two companies, Worldpay and Adyen, who can offer merchant acquiring across the globe.  The idea is that multinationals can collapse dozens of local acquiring relationships into a single relationship with Worldpay, who can consolidate back office tasks, unify reporting and, through its purview of all the merchant’s global payment volumes, boost authorization rates. 

So, let’s quickly recap.  It’s 2018 and the flurry of transformative acquisition activity has resulted in four major independent US merchant acquirers that look something like this:

To varying degrees, they have all diversified away from their legacy, decelerating distribution channels and into integrated payments.  First Data still derives most of its revenue from banks but has also vertically integrated into software and hardware via Clover, which has been a massive success.  Global Payments has also vertically integrated into software.  Worldpay and Total Systems, on the other hand, are partnering rather than competing with software vendors. 

_“The battle between every startup and incumbent comes down to whether the startup gets distribution before the incumbent gets innovation”_ – Alex Rampell, a16z

In the payments space, you can think about scale in terms of distribution or technology.  The incumbents’ collective push into integrated payments, e-commerce, and software, while related to technology, is really about distribution.  Distribution has historically been a powerful advantage.  It kept First Data – with its inferior technology, precarious balance sheet, and addled strategic ploys – kicking for a whole decade after its LBO, and arguably played a meaningful role in Clover’s success.  When you’re an incumbent and distribution is your game, the main commercial logic underpinning acquisitions is selling acquired technology into an existing installed base (i.e., Vantiv’s 400 salespeople cross-selling Litl’s e-commerce offering to brick-and-mortar clients who previously processed their e-commerce transactions with someone else). 

The brute force distribution-driven path to dominance long pursued by incumbent acquirers stands in stark contrast to the first principles, merchant-centric approach of modern payment facilitators like Adyen, Stripe, and Square.  Adyen is Surinamese for “start over again” (as in, “the existing payments infrastructure is so shitty, we need to start over again?”), and true to its name, the company designed a single global platform from scratch that made it easy for merchants to integrate and that generated higher authorization rates than incumbents, who relied on a patchwork of local systems.  Stripe designed a responsive, developer-friendly payments system that gained rapid traction with online native businesses and startups who weren’t bogged down by legacy commitments and could evaluate services on their merits.  Square offered inexpensive and rapid onboarding for micro-merchants long ignored by banks and traditional acquirers, distributing terminals at a loss and monetizing POS software delivered on a proliferating base of tablets and smartphones.  All three have scaled organically (for the most part) to impressive volumes by focusing first on merchant needs(6).  And as these newcomers, with their unified global platforms and strong engineering and design cultures, face off against legacy acquirers run by salesmen and ex-bankers, the hidden liabilities of a distribution-led strategy stand into stark relief.

One of the expressed goals behind the legacy acquirers’ many transformative acquisitions is platform consolidation, where the combined company takes stock of all its platforms, shuts down the redundant/outdated ones, and runs its aggregated volumes over what remains, giving rise to cost savings, faster product introductions, and better execution.  It sounds good and yet in practice this never seems to pan out.  Legacy platforms don’t really die in part because migrating merchants to a new platform is a messy, disruptive affair that gives merchants an excuse to evaluate other options.  First Data, after pursuing an ambitious consolidation project for close to a decade, finally gave up a few years and resigned itself to maintaining a swarm of disparate platforms.  Vantiv once boasted a “single, proprietary technology platform”, but this conceit became harder to maintain as it splurged on one acquisition after the next (the “single platform” language was later dropped from its 10K).  Today it must bridge at least two disparate architectures – Vantiv’s in the US and Worldpay’s overseas.  In 2010, Global Payments placed a modern processing platform into service, one designed to replace several legacy ones.  6 years later, the platform was handling transactions in just 9 markets and for a “limited number” of US merchants. 

Incumbent acquirers, due to their decades-long grab for distribution and scale, now wrestle with a hodgepodge of different payments architectures and software layers that makes it difficult to scale new features across channels and geographies.  Even when incumbents claim to offer a complete bundle of services the globe over, as Worldpay does, they are really fulfilling that promise through a daisy chain of different systems.  To protect their distribution moats, these guys spent boatloads on acquisitions that have today left them maintaining many different processing platforms off which they can’t now wean themselves and that consume scarce engineering resources that could be otherwise used to develop new products.

By contrast, Adyen hasn’t done a single acquisition since its founding in 2006.  The company deliberately designed and built in-house, from the bottom up, a single modern system that could process transactions across any geography, channel (in-store, e-commerce), and payment type (credit, debit, wallet, QR codes).  A multinational brand that wanted to accept payments in 100 different countries could do so through a single Adyen integration vs. multiple connections to Worldpay’s disparate, region specific platforms.  The same goes for new products and features.  Whereas a legacy acquirer would have to customize, say, a risk tool for its platform in the US, then the UK, then Brazil, then Japan, etc. Adyen could roll out that product to merchants across all regions simultaneously. 

Moreover, legacy acquirers must reconcile data across siloed systems, which often leads to information loss and lower authorization rates – authorization rates are a critical KPI. For large global merchants, a 1%-2% improvement can mean 10s of millions in incremental sales volumes – issues that Adyen’s single platform architecture resolves.  To cite a specific example offered to me by the company, the authorization request that an acquirer sends the card issuing bank can contain up to a hundred data fields.  Each card issuer responds to authorization requests differently depending on how those fields are completed.  Supposedly, for reasons I don’t totally understand, having all transaction data in one place allows Adyen to more accurately tweak the messages it sends according to each issuer’s preferences, which drives higher authorization rates.  Here’s another example. By having all transaction data across channels on one platform, Adyen can see that the attempted purchase of a $5k recliner on this iPad comes from a frequent high-end furniture shopper who makes similar purchases offline. A legacy acquirer who has offline data in one system and online data in another might block this legitimate transaction. And having the gateway, risk management, and processing functions contained on the same platform (“full stack acquiring”) rather than disjointedly split among different providers lets Adyen better detect fraud and gives merchants better insight into why certain transactions were rejected. 

Like Adyen, Stripe has also taken an organic, technology-centric approach to building its core platform, optimizing for rapid onboarding and easy integration.  It has gotten major traction with sexy companies like Slack, Lyft, Shopify, Deliveroo, and Doordash that have carried Stripe along in their ascent.  The company has expanded well beyond the gateway, offering flexible financing (Stripe Capital) and allowing online merchants to accept in-person payments (Stripe Terminal).  It recently launched reporting tools that offer cohort analyses and manage tax complexities.  Its corporate credit card can be constrained with spending limits and rather than randomly scatter shooting points for gas and coffee and office supplies, doles out rewards based on a merchant’s top spend categories.  Stripe Connect, which online marketplaces use to distribute payments to sub-merchants, applies computer vision to extract information from a driver’s license and checks it against government databases, verifying the identity of someone booking a car hotel room in real time.  The enormous complexity underlying each of these solutions is cloaked by a few lines of code.  

Square has been building out the components of an expansive payments ecosystem that covers both the merchant and consumer side.  On the merchant side, you can think of the core payments platform along three different vectors.  First, Square sells the familiar general-purpose point of sale application and its vertical instantiations (restaurants, retail), which today account for 80% of the company’s GMV.  Second, Square integrates its payments platform into a bunch of popular third-party apps like Quickbooks and online stores like Magento, WooCommerce, GoDaddy’s GoCentral (this is equivalent to integrated payments that legacy acquirers often talk about).  Finally, Square offers up its payment platform as an operating system upon which programmers can develop apps that address customized use cases.  Sellers can take what they need from Square’s toolkit and connect it to systems that they may already have running.  For example, with Square Reader SDK, Shake Shack coded its POS application on top of Square’s hardware and payments architecture.  Opening the platform to third party developers has allowed Square to migrate from micro-merchants, who are okay with an out-of-the-box POS, to larger merchants with more customized needs. 

So, what we have is a mismash of horizontal and vertical integrations.  Square integrates with GoDaddy but also owns Weebly, a competing website builder.  It integrates with TouchBistro but also owns a proprietary POS for restaurants.  It integrates with Postmates, but also owns Caviar.  This seems strategically all over the place, but the way I see it, Square is using vertical integration to glean lessons that can be propagated to third party integrations, not the other way around.  I kind of see this in a similar light to Microsoft selling both OS-agnostic applications and Surface notebooks or Google selling Pixel phones even as its services are made available everywhere…the integrated version is the most readily consumable form of Square’s merchant services and the purest expression(7) of what those services could be.

Against the considered, merchant-oriented approach taken by Adyen, Stripe, and Square, the way First Data, Global Payments, Total Systems, and Worldpay have created value seem somewhat blunt and uninspiring.  Their filings and transcripts are saturated with the usual soulless big company stuff about synergies and scale.  The giant cluster of copy-cat integrated payments acquisitions between ~2013-2017 – far from a proactive, inspired effort to deliver more value to the merchant experience – seem at best, a tardy and reactive (albeit, strategically driven) response to shifting competitive dynamics and at worse, an attempt to cosmetically match the high-single digit organic growth targets being set by peers.

Global Payments is shamelessly self-conscious about how its stock is perceived, going so far as to guide analysts towards valuing the company on a sum-of-the-parts basis to highlight the value of its considerable vertical SaaS bets over the last few years.  Rather than remaining opportunistic about deals, management promulgates that 60% of its revenue will come from technology enabled distribution by 2020, which makes me wonder whether it is sound strategy or growth optics motivating the company’s transformative moves.  TSYS’ foray into merchant acquiring was explicitly driven by diversification for its own sake.  With over 90% of its revenue coming from core processing for card issuers, the company saw profits in its US issuer processing segment slump by 40% from 2006 to 2009 as two large issuer customers, Wachovia and Washing Mutual, collapsed.  It was probably no coincidence that in the aftermath, Total Systems aggressively acquired its way into merchant acquiring, where customer concentration is much lower.  First Data has surprisingly displayed the most foresight and gumption of the bunch through its success with Clover, which started off as a concept 7 years ago and has since blossomed to become a serious competitor to Square…but at just 5% of total payment volumes, Clover is a dim beacon amid a vast ocean of legacy tech and distribution.

Whereas Stripe, Adyen, and Square are setting the tempo of payments innovation, their platforms deliberately designed to accommodate whatever shape payments may take – Adyen supports all its channels and payment functions on a common platform; Square leveraged the technology powering it P2P Cash App to also support Instant Deposits and Square Card (its business debit card) – you get the distinct sense that legacy acquirers will always be playing defense, buying their way into the next big growth channel.  Everyone wants growth, but there is a huge difference between building a foundation that generates it and merely buying it.   

Fast following can be sound strategy for incumbents with a commanding lead, assuming the advantage driving that lead remains relevant.  And Square, Stripe, and Adyen, with their hundreds of billions of volumes and superior growth rates, puts this assumption into doubt for legacy players. 

One reason that incumbents have been so slow to respond to nimbler competitors is that they are anchored by legacy technology, which I discussed.  Another is that they are hampered by channel conflicts.  By the time Global and Vantiv pursued integrated payments acquisitions, Mercury had already spent ~12-years building integrations into thousands of software versions.  I suspect a key reason that incumbents took so long is that they didn’t want to create conflicts with their existing channels. 

The third factor is culture.  Maybe this ties back to the starting distribution advantages incumbents enjoyed by once being owned by banks.  With referral channels on the ready – Worldpay, before it was divest, got nearly all its volumes from RBS; Vantiv sourced most of its volume from Fifth Third before it was acquired; First Data still relies on bank referrals and joint ventures for most of its volumes – they didn’t have to think too rigorously about how to build great products (some incumbents have pointed to their on-the-ground support as a key value prop, but this can just as well be an indictment on the usability of their products.  80% of Square’s large merchants, those with > 500k in sales, self-onboard).  Or it could just be that most of their corporate existence overlapped with a time when every company didn’t need to be a tech company, when it was not just okay but actually mandatory that you be deeply embedded in the bank and ISO apparatus, which in turn instilled a sales and banker ethos within those organizations that that now stands in stark relief to engineering and design driven cultures of Adyen, Stripe, and Square(8).  It’s not that incumbent acquirers couldn’t eventually buy or develop this or that feature; it’s that 1/ organizational debt and cultural burdens prevent them from doing so at comparable speed and 2/ the tiresome routine of playing catch up while maintaining/integrating legacy systems overwhelms long-term strategic planning.

The incumbents have bought their way into latest trends, but are they thinking seriously about how adaptable their infrastructure is to unforeseeable opportunities and fleshing out ecosystems?  They talk about being more than just cost centers, but how are they helping merchants grow their top-lines? Because it seems to me that incumbents mostly see themselves as a passive rake, no more in control the rate of payments flowing through their system than a toll booth operator is of the pace of traffic traversing his station.  By contrast, consider what Square is doing with initiatives like Instant Deposits and Square Capital, giving merchants immediate access to funds to invest in working capital and supplies, which then translates into more sales and payment volumes running through the Square POS.  Merchants can use the email addresses collected from customers at the point-of-sale to set up marketing campaigns from the Square dashboard.  Square issues business debit cards that tie directly to merchant Square accounts and then recycles the interchange fees into discounts that merchants can earn by spending at other Square merchants. 

Square is building out a consumer business too with Cash App (the #1 most downloaded financial services app on US iOS for the last 2 years) and the Square Cash card (a prepaid debit card linked to the Cash App account), and plodding towards a closed loop ecosystem like the one PayPal has developed over the last 2 decades.  Square is not alone in offering a prepaid consumer card.  Total Systems, through its acquisition of NetSpend, has had a prepaid card on the market since 2013.  But TSYS slipped into the all too familiar pattern of satisfying distributors.  It thought of prepaid cards as SKUs to be distributed through brick-and-mortar retailers who then hung those cards, like bait, on J-hooks to attract foot traffic.  Square, on the other hand, thought about its Cash Card as part of a broader ecosystem.  It started with the job of facilitating P2P payments through smartphones, let network effects take hold, and _then_ issued a card that linked to the account balance stored in that app so that consumers could spend their balances at merchants.      

Or consider that back in 2014, 2 years after Total Systems acquired Square competitor ProPay, the head of TSYS’ Merchant Services division sniped, “we are still trying to figure out how \[Square\] gets to profitability with their business model”, seemingly oblivious to the difference between reported profits and unit economics. ProPay never nailed the software piece or appreciated the platform aspects aspects of its payment system the way Clover and Square did. It is irrelevant today.

And now it looks as though Square is starting to bridge the merchant and consumer sides of its business.  Square Payroll, launched in 2015, was a natural extension of its point of sale system – cash coming into the business must then be used to pay the waiters, servers, and other hourly staff (who, so it happens, comprise 60% of the US labor force).  Many of these employees don’t have bank accounts…but they do have smartphones, and on those smart phones they can install Square’s Cash app to receive direct deposits from Square merchants.  A Square Cash card, which attaches to the balances in the Cash app, is the medium through which employees become consumers who can earn cash back (a “Boost”) by using the Cash card at certain merchants.  As Square Cash card achieves mainstream acceptance, you can imagine Square granting double points or something for spending at Square merchants, further compelling Square POS adoption.  Growth on the merchant side reinforces Square product adoption on consumer side and vice-versa (demand generation and its feedback effects on merchant adoption are also driving PayPal’s recently announced acquisition of Honey).  Payments stay contained within this micro economy and Square takes a tax on all of it – earning interchange on card use, points on instant access to funds, and merchant acquiring fees. 

Anyways, I’m impressed by Adyen’s first principles architecture and Square’s systems-level approach and find it almost impossible to imagine legacy acquirers deliberating with the same long-term focus or executing with similar agility.  But that doesn’t necessarily make the legacy acquirers, in their current core/issuer processor amalgamated form, bad investments.

(6) Adyen processes ~$200bn, Square is run-rating at over $100bn, and Stripe handles payments volumes in the “hundreds of billions”.  Adyen and Stripe are growing volumes by nearly 50% and 25%, respectively, compared to the high-single digit growth from legacy peers.
