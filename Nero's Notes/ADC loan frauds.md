# ADC Loan Frauds

During the S&L crisis, many [[Profile of Control Frauds| control frauds]] used ADC loans (Acquisition, Development and Construction) to defraud investors.

The typical control fraud made ADC loans with the following characteristics:
- There was no downpayment.
- There was substantial up-front points and fees.
- All of those points and fees were self-funded: the S&L loaned the buyer the money to pay the S&L points and fees.
- The term of the loan was two to three years.
- There was no repayment of principal on the loan prior to maturity. The loan was interest-only, or non-amortizing.
- The S&L self-funded all of the interest payments. The S&L paid itself the interest when it came due out of an interest reserve. The S&L increased the borrower's debt by an amount equal to the interest reserve.
- The interest rate on the loan was considerably above prime.
- The borrower had no liability on the debt (the loan was non-recourse). His construction company was indebted, but the developer was not. He did not provide any meaningful personal guarantee of his company's debt.
- The developer pledged the real estate project (the collateral) to secure the loan.
- The loan amount equaled the (purported) value of the collateral.
- It was common for the borrower to receive at closing a developer's profit that could represent up to 2% of the loan balance.
- It was common for borrowers to give S&Ls an equity kicker, an interest in the developer's net profits on the project. At first, these kickers often exceeded 50%. After the accounting profession issed a "notice to practitioners" that said 50% equity kicker was evidence that the transaction was not a true loan, it became common to give a 49% interest.
