- Selling accounts receivable: whenever you spot a cffo boost from the sale of receivables, also realize that by definition, the company's DSO will have been lowered as well. To calculate DSO on an apple-to-apple basis, simply add back sold receivables that remain outstanding at quarter end for all period.
- Investors should be as concerned when they see a large decrease in DSO (particularly following a period of rapidly rising DSO) as they are when they see a substantial increase in DSO.
- Watch for increases in receivables other than accounts receivables
- Watch out for varying company DSO calculation . Astute investors should note a change in the calculation of DSO, when management changes how it computes operational metrics it is often attempting to hide some deterioration from investors.
