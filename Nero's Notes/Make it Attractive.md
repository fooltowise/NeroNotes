- The 2nd law of Behavior Change is _Make it Attractive_
- The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming
- Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.
- It is the anticipation of a reward - not the fulfillment of it - that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike
- Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you _want_ to do with an action you _need_ to do.

- **The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us**
- We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because **we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe** 
- We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (friends and family), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige)
- One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group
- The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. Most days, we'd rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.
- If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive


- The inversion of the 2nd law of behavior change is _Make it unattractive._
- Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper underlying motive
- Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires
- The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them. The prediction leads to a feeling
- Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive
- Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings. Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.
