### Nick, can you share some context to your role and responsibilities when you were at Fastenal?

I stared with Fastenal as an inside sales guy, learning the business. Went to outside sales and was doing really well. I got promoted to the manager position, ran the store there for about a year, and then moved up to district manager position. I did that for a little over five years, up in Alaska.

### Did you go through the Fastenal School of Business?

Yes; I went through many programs, when I was out in Minnesota. They are always looking to improve everyone’s ability, whether that be in selling, management or whatever it is they do. They do a great job at the Fastenal School of Business. From my time there, I know there were a lot of people would go through it, get a lot of learning, do pretty well and then wind up getting picked off by somebody else that doesn’t do that kind of stuff.

### What makes the School of Business unique?

They keep it going; they keep it in the forefront. It’s part of their culture to train. We get offered classes at my current company, through vendors, but they’re not required. This is in-house and there are so many things that are required, each year. They do it just like university where you have to take one before you take another. They build on each other and they really get the employees to understand either the business, leadership or just products. There is a lot of hands-on training in the construction industry, where you are out there, using the tools, understanding what it means to crank a bolt too hard. Everyone in the world would be surprised how a bolt starts to break down and become elastic, without a ton of pressure; it’s pretty impressive.

### So they almost get you being the customer, using the products, to understand how the customer feels when something goes wrong or when you deal with them?

Yes; and there are so many details about every product. I’ve forgotten more than I ever wanted to know. They can really get down to where someone brings something into you and you look at and it’s amazing what information you can get off little tick marks on a bolt.

### Can you recall any specific principles or learnings from your School of Business experience at Fastenal?

It probably all started with Bob Kierlin. He is one of the five founders and the original thought guy behind Fastenal, way back in the 60s. I remember him talking about a couple of things. He talked about being only as good as the people we have. He wanted to make sure we were both training our people and trying to find the right people. The other thing was that they always talked about the culture there. Nobody was above anybody else. You could call the CEO; you could email whoever you wanted. There is great story about being in the restroom, at corporate. Bob Kierlin was retired and, I think, not even on the board of directors at this point because he made a rule that, once you turned 78, you couldn’t even be on the board of directors anymore. He was literally just around and he was in there, cleaning the bathroom, just because he loved Fastenal. You’d never know this guy was a multi-millionaire.

### Why do people churn away from Fastenal?

When it comes to their margins and their money, Fastenal is a tight company and I think, competition wise, when it comes to paying the employees, they weren’t really high on the scale. If people learn all these great selling techniques, there are sales jobs out there that tend to pay a lot more.

That’s the other thing. You do have some people in Fastenal and that is where they deserve to be. If you had 10 people and you put them from one through 10, maybe the bottom six are getting paid what they are supposed to be getting paid. But then you’ve got those three or four at the top that separate themselves from the pack, where Fastenal really need to pay these people a little bit more to keep them, or they are going to jump ship.

It is not that Fastenal is a bad company. We all work to get a pay check and you can do some good things there and make some good money. It’s just that they hire young, but I’m not saying that they don’t hire older people too. But as district manager, we have lots of different hats we put on and one of them is recruiting. We would go to the universities and go to the business classes and teach a business class for a day; talk about sales, running a company, management styles and you get to have relationships with those students. You start to say, do you want to do a paid internship? They come and start working part-time for Fastenal at 20 years old. We’re just paying them minimum wage, or a little more than that, they graduate, they start to learn a lot of things and then maybe they jump ship or, in terms of their career, they really wanted to be something else.

### So there is little flexibility in the pay, in those inside and outside sales jobs?

Yes.

### Do you think that is a problem, long term?

I don’t know; they’ve been doing it for so long. Knowing Bob Kierlin and all his sayings, the culture of everyone being on the same playing field, that is there. But I do wonder, because he’s not around anymore, if he doesn’t know that maybe they need to pay their people more to keep good people. At the same time, they’ve been doing this for quite a while and they’re still trucking along. Even when I left Fastenal, as a district manager, and was doing quite a bit up in Alaska, I knew that the great big blue machine would truck on, even after I left. Even though I felt as if I was a big part of it, I knew that someone would step in and do the work because there were a lot of great employees there. It really is a good company.

I think they’ll do just fine. I think it’s a little bit part of their business plan to have turnover. Everyone knows there is going to be some turnover.

### I guess they also manage for that? If they train people so well, it’s not that they are giving that education in replacement for dollars, but it does get those employees up the chain, in other companies?

It was a concern at corporate. I remember being in a class in the School of Business, as a district manager, and we were discussing the cost to onboard a new employee and get them through the Fastenal School of Business. How much do we spend on that employee in the first six months? It’s a high dollar value; it wasn’t cheap. When you have a high turnover ratio, we had to question whether we were throwing money out of the window. The top brass never wanted to hear that we needed to pay more. That was what most of the district managers were all thinking and saying. They were trying to find ways to solve the problem, without that being the only solution. Over the years, some things have changed.

### Can you share a bit of context or background to the structure of your branches in Alaska, when you were district manager?

When I was the district manager up there, I had six locations; Fairbanks, Wasilla, Anchorage, Kenai, Juneau and Ketchikan. Typically, you have a branch manager and then it depends on how much money they do a month to see how many inside sales people you have. You have an outside sales person and those people also tend to be your delivery drivers. They load up their truck, they make their deliveries to their customers, as they are making sales calls. It is not as if there is a dedicated delivery driver.

In some much larger branches, they probably have some other delivery drivers but I’ve never really heard of that across the company. I was also in the Northwest and have been to mini branches all over the West Coast and some on the East Coast. There was always the manager or outside sales person that was making the deliveries in the Fastenal truck, down to their own personal customers.

Let’s say you’re doing $150,000 to $200,000 a month; they’ve got a couple of outside sales people and a few inside people. That is how the structure tends to be. There is always a manager, an inside person and, depending on sales, you would have the outside sales person. If your branch is not doing a ton of money a month – maybe $45,000 – then for P&L purposes, your manager is also your outside sales person, helping to grow the business. Once they get to that point where it’s grown enough, then they get the outside sales person.

That’s not typical. We typically want to put in a new place of business where they can already afford an outside sales person; it’s a bit like the chicken before the egg. But as a general rule, it’s those three positions and, depending on how big it is, you keep adding more.

### Within the fastener category, which is clearly the biggest portion of sales in most of the locations, what is roughly the mix between private label and branded fasteners?

Fastener wise, in my mind, it’s over 90% of private Fastenal label. For socket head cap screws, we had Holo-Krome as a brand but then we bought them and brought it in-house; all the socket head cap screws became Fastenal branded. We manufacture the bolts and screws ourselves and we have US branded stuff as well as things coming from overseas, in very high-tech manufacturing facilities around the world.

The thing we always talked about is that we would bring them in by the millions and so our costs were super low. We can come into the market competitively with everybody else, but the margin can be so high on fasteners. For stainless steel, we are at 80% or 90% margin, in some cases. Overall, we’re always trying to run over 50% margin, but that is when you are selling all the other stuff. When you are heavy on nuts and bolts, you are going to have a pretty high margin. At the back of my mind, I’m trying to think what we sold that wasn’t Fastenal branded, within fasteners? Very little.

### Does that drive the branch gross margin? If it’s 50% at the store level and 80% or 90% of that gross margin is fasteners?

Over the years, in their quarterly reports or their margins, they have probably seen those come down a bit. That is likely to be due to the fact that they’ve pushed a lot more into the safety market; they are the number two or three safety supplier in the United States. There is lower margin on that stuff. It has become a lot more private label, over the last 10 years, in the Fastenal world of safety, but it depends on where you are and what your location sells a lot of. If it’s a lot of fasteners, you are not going to struggle with margin; you are going to be in the 60s without a problem.

### Let’s say your branch does $150K per month in revenue and let’s say you lose 30K to on-site or vending, what type of assortment is that?

I remember some of the transitions because there was a huge push into on-site. Managers want to grow their business so if they are going to take a chunk off and send it over here to the on-site business, their major concern was pay. This was part of their pay program; they were making money off that gross margin. There were incentives for doing that. The first year, you still get so much margin from that. I don’t remember the exact details on that part of it but they definitely tried to show you that it wasn’t going to hurt you.

They actually had case studies about a huge $30,000 business that you are working on and growing, but it’s also a big percentage of your time to deal with it. When they take that off you, 150 down to 120, and they go and make it on-site, they put a person over there and you don’t have to deal with it much at all anymore. The comeback of finding other customers and smaller customers, to help you grow, goes much faster.

You might get back to 150 within that first year, pretty easily, but before, when you were at 150, to get that extra 30, of other customers, is going to take you two or three years, because you’re spending so much time on that on-site customer.

It was easy to show with a bunch of case studies, within the business, where that had happened. Your branch will actually grow faster if you shed some of these large customers to an on-site position.

### And the larger accounts lost are obviously lower gross margin if they are bigger, national accounts?

Yes, so it will help their gross margin.

### When those accounts move on-site, what type of assortment do you lose?

I think it’s a mix, for sure. Yes, for big manufacturing businesses, you are probably going to lose a lot of your fastener business, but it might also just be a big safety company. A lot of them were big construction or mining companies, which was fasteners but also MRO products – maintenance, repair and operations – where it is the conglomerate of all those little things; cut-off blades, grinding wheels and just going through thousands of those.

It probably opens up the store a bit too. When we go on-site, one of the things that we ask of the customer is to give us a location to stock some of your product right here, on-site. We’ve got a guy that shows up and he’s got a caged off area with products that technically haven’t been sold to you, so you move some of that away as well.

### So the key thing here is that the branch manager can actually lose the 30K, free up more time and then use that time and effort to grow the branch again, to 150K per month?

Yes; and the on-site grows too. You’ve got an employee that’s there, five days a week. You are sitting in the safety meetings and you literally become one of their employees. We have so many case studies from customers where people say, “Will; I didn’t even know he didn’t work for us; I didn’t realize he was a Fastenal employee”.

### Don’t they wear the Fastenal uniform?

Maybe not all the time. You get so entwined within their business that you are helping them. They need to try and figure out what they need to do to solve a process; people are cutting their fingers so we need a new cut glove. They’re not going anywhere else because you are right there. Hopefully, you are on the tip of their tongue or at the end of their fingertips when they are typing an email. Sometimes, competitor XYZ walks in the door and they’re here, so they get asked to help find something and so they will order from somebody else.

Being on-site, you are just growing both, so the more you peel those things off, we notice that the on-sites are going to grow and the branches are going to grow faster. You mentioned vending. If you just had vending customers, you never just pulled them off a branch. As you grew more and more vending customers, maybe you had someone dedicated to that within your branch. At one store I ran, I kept selling more and more vending machines. In our back room, I set up a location for all the products in the vending machines, by part number, so we could pick them very easily, throw them in boxes and go and fill them up.

My part-time guy started doing it for us. He’d come in early, hop in the truck, go and make deliveries to the vending machines and he’d be back by 8:00AM and customers had all they needed for the day or the week. We never pulled that off the branch unless it’s an on-site customer and, once you’re in there, you can ask them if they want vending machines there too.

One of the selling points for me was, when we signed all of Amazon, across the country, to our vending program I was like, you guys sell everything; why do you need to buy something from us? It was for the convenience of having vending machines in their distribution hubs and having branded product in there, such as Body Guard gloves. There is a famous Amazon image of a guy with an Amazon box and you see the Body Guard glove on his hand that, obviously, went through Fastenal everywhere. That Amazon found it important to have that in their systems, speaks volumes.

And then it was [[Walmart]]. Every [[Walmart]] in the country started putting our lockers in their backroom. They weren’t even buying anything out of them. They were literally using Fastenal lockers to keep track of all their scanners. The charger for the scanner is inside the locker and, after using their scanners for the day, they would check it back in and, if it needed a charge, it would get charged and the next person couldn’t check it out until it was done charging. They were paying us a monthly fee to use our lockers.

### Before we discuss vending, what was the biggest challenge shifting branch revenue to on-site?

There’s something I like to call change management and that is, literally, having conversations with the manager and doing it that way, to where they are part of the decision. If you just come in there and tell somebody you are moving something, they’re not going to be too happy about it; it’s not going to go smoothly. It’s about going in there and having conversations; if we do this, do you realize this? All those positive points that happen where your branch is going to grow. We’re still going to pay you for this, for a certain period of time, because you found this business. You are the reason this business is here. That is really the only challenge.

When it comes to the P&Ls, starting a new branch code and moving the money over, Fastenal has that down. I’m with a new company that is about half the size but we are a quarter of the way along when it comes to reporting our financials and getting all that information correct and out quickly. Whatever they’ve got behind the scenes for their P&Ls is just fantastic. Every morning you would have your updated numbers to a tee, on what’s going on in the business.

### As a branch manager, you’d know exactly your P&L for the month?

The district manager has it and then we would disseminate that. There was a program you would log into and it’s updated daily. Each position within the company sees more and more. But for their own location, for sure, they would see what’s going on. You know your margins and you don’t have to wait for all these numbers to trickle down.

### Do you think the challenge of incentivizing or encouraging the branch managers to let that $30,000 a month go to on-site is becoming much easier over time, as there are more case studies to show it actually improves the whole business?

For sure. One of our managers let a customer go and, after a year, they said, I need to do this more. Can we get rid of my $5,000 customer because they are a pain in my butt and taking up 60% of my time

### You mentioned how vending was actually additive to the branch, rather than taking dollars away, as with on-site. How does it not take away from the dollars you are selling in the branch?

It doesn’t take away the dollars to another branch location. It doesn’t become a branch code, on its own. Maybe eventually it does; maybe that is the route they go where, in a district, you just have a vending hub or vending branch code. But you do sometimes take away a little bit of your sales, at first. Especially if it’s a customer you’ve had for a long time.

If you’ve had their business for a long time and you sell them gloves, drill bits and anything they’d want to get out of a vending machine, if you are going to move it over into a vending machine, there is a good likelihood you are going to see your sales of those particular products go down 50%. That is how efficient vending machines become for customers; that’s why they love them so much. Their loss of product, just walking out the door, goes way down. The technician that grabs the bag of 12 gloves and he goes and uses two or three of them and then maybe leaves them on the construction site and then comes back and grabs more. There is no tracking of that; there is no thought process.

When they have to put in their employee number and go and grab their one pair of gloves at a time, out of a vending machine, they just grab the two they need and they know they’re being tracked; it’s almost a mental thing. Over all the years, I only had one customer that was very adamant about tracking their employees and, at the end of the month, saying, you’ve vended $150 of product and everyone else only vended $60 worth of product; what’s going on? I had one big customer that would do that and would want their monthly report set up a certain way. The customers get a monthly report set up however they want it. We can set it up by employee, pivot table it out to where it’s just about how much money they vended.

Then you had customers that used it in a good way. They’re in a process; they’re going through bits in their CNC machine and doing certain things. Here’s the day shift guy that is going through three bits and putting out 1,000 parts and then the night shift guy is going through five bits and putting out 1,000 parts. Why are you using five bits? It’s not that you’re in trouble; what’s wrong with the process? Why is this guy able to be more efficient and not burn through a $500 bit every two hours, like you’re doing? His is lasting three hours. So it becomes an insight for the customer too.

As I was saying, if you’ve had that business for a long time, your sales are going to go down in that category. When you sign vending, one thing you talk about is, again, team spend amount. When we go through that and their spend starts to go down, you can come back to the table and say, what else can you sell me? What else could we put into the vending that I’m not currently selling you? Obviously, you can see that you are saving a lot of money on drill bits. I had a customer that went from $2,000 a month in drill bits to $500 or $700 a month, because they were now coming out of the vending machine, in packs of two. I know you are buying XYZ over here from Grainger or somebody else, and their price just happens to be better than mine; I just can’t get to that price. But couldn’t you save a lot of money if we put it into the Fastenal vending machine? I could sell you duct tape for $9 a roll and I know you can go to [[Home Depot]] or Lowe’s and get it for $6.50 a roll, but if you’re using half the amount of duct tape in a month because it’s coming out of my vending machine, could I sell that to you. They realize they are going to save $500 even though it is going to cost them a couple more dollars per roll.

It becomes a selling point to get the other products that you’re not selling. If you’ve got a good sales person, you should be able to grow the business, even if it takes a dive at the beginning. You’ve got to be in there; you’ve got to be monitoring what’s going on and then, in the long run, Fastenal’s business has grown with vending. I can’t tell you the percentage, off the top of my head, but I remember when it came to the sales number, if you had a branch that did $100,000 in sales, before vending, they are now doing $150,000 after three years and they have vending. It’s not just $50,000 in vending; it’s probably $80,000 in vending and $70,000 in other sales.

### You can back it out from the report. I think it’s around 48% to 50% of the branch revenue today that is actually vending.

Yes, which is crazy. They installed their first vending machine in 2011; that’s just 10 years ago.

### Is that because, as you said, the customer looks at the total cost of ownership? If it saves on the wastage, if they contract their inventory in terms of what is being used, it actually encourages them to buy more stuff through the vending machines, even it’s more expensive than a Home Depot, for example?

Correct. But maybe there are certain products that Fastenal just can’t sell, that they just don’t have the ability to sell, that will allow customers to put some of those things in lockers. It definitely opens the door to get them anything we can sell.

You would be shocked at some of the stuff going through vending machines across the country. Fastenal has a great ability to create a special part number – we call them BSS numbers; branch special stock – with a description, with a cost and then sell it to a customer.

### What type of products would we be amazed at?

I had a manager in Kenai, who would sell bales of hay; he sold a washing machine and dryer. The reason is because they were oil platforms, out in the Bay, outside of Kenai; their washer and dryer broke and they needed a new one immediately. They know the one they want at Home Depot, but they can’t just go down to Home Depot and buy it. So the branch manager went to buy it for them, charged them an extra $150 or so – they didn’t even care about the cost – and sent it out to them. As long as it wasn’t some chemical that we needed to register or something like that, we could buy and sell anything.

I had a customer who would know the price. He would actually go shopping for me and say, right next door, at Do it Best hardware, they’ve got these sawhorses I really need. I quoted him and I was $25 higher and had a four-week lead time; I had to go and set up the vendor, have them shipped to me when, literally, there were two of them sitting right next door. The customer told me to go and buy them from next door, mark them up and get them to him; he needed them tomorrow. The ability that Fastenal has to do that, to act quickly and get their customers what they need, is huge. I miss that.

### So are there any contractual agreements with the customer that means they don’t have another relationship like Fastenal that they could go to, to buy those types of products and, therefore, Fastenal is kind of like an in-house inventory purchasing manager?

It can be. When you grow that relationship and the customer is in a situation where it is not that easy for them and they don’t have a purchasing card and they don’t have the ability to get this done quickly, to get a purchase order sent over to this other hardware store. Fastenal has a charge account and they can react pretty quickly. They really push that decentralized decision making when you first start at Fastenal. We give you the ability, in the branch, to make a lot of decisions.

As you are there, you feel as if you see a lot of those disappear over time. You may say, I used to be able to do that. When we first started, you could go and put the price at whatever you wanted. You could sell it off cost, you could sell it off a margin or a discount structure. You had multiple options to choose from. Nowadays, it’s more of slider. They give you a range; there’s red, yellow and green and you need to try to be within green. If you’ve got to go to red, go to red, but you’re probably going to have to explain why you did so. You have no idea, right away, what the margin might be; they took away some of those things.

That was a struggle for a while, trying to get people to understand what those numbers mean and where they come from. Here’s a part number that’s sold across the company. We put it into quartiles; quartile one, two, three and four. Here’s your high people; we’re going to get rid of the people that we sell way too high for and we’re going to get rid of the bottom quartile that we sell way too low for. Here are your middle two quartiles; here’s your median. We are then going to use that slider and be able to move it within that range and try to be more competitive.

You do have the new employee who walks in the door, they’ve been here a week and you’ve got somebody coming in to buy something and you have no idea what the range for that is so the range system worked really well for people like them. For the older employees who had been around for 10 years, they were ticked about it because they wanted the ability to do whatever they wanted.

### What were the biggest challenges in onboarding new vending customers?

Commitment; people don’t like to sign things. Having to commit to $2,000 a month in spending, for every machine they signed up for was difficult. That number came down a little bit, over time. It comes down to that salesmanship of explaining there is no penalty; if they didn’t get to that number, we weren’t going to go back and charge them a fee of $700 because they only spent $1,300. I’m going to go back and say, what else could they buy from me because they were a little light on their spending and this is a $10,000 piece of equipment that is put in their facility for free. We just needed to cover some of our costs. In the long run, you’re going to help me pay for this machine, over the next two years, but right now, I need to make sure that we are on track for some of that.

### Is it roughly $10,000 to build and install the machine?

That is the number I remember off the top of my head.

### It’s installed free for the customer and they have to guarantee to $1,500 or $2,000 a month in spending?

Correct; they’re not buying the machine. That has changed over time. I know that, at one point, Fastenal purchased the company that makes the vending machines, so we probably lowered our cost on the machine. We did not purchase the software side of the house and so, as part of the purchase, we have to use their software for a certain period of time. Right around the time I was leaving, I know they were bringing some of that software in-house.

Nothing really changed. We went to our own website which actually became really nice. You could go onto its own network and log into the vending machine and see all the parts and you could change things out much more quickly. I’m sure, in the last couple of years, it’s just become faster and easier in-house and, hopefully, cheaper on the back end.

### Let’s say it costs roughly $10,000 to build and install; $2,000 a month, $24,000 a year in revenue. What is the rough gross margin that you get from vending relative to the branches, for example?

I would say, you’re probably running close to 40% out of the vending machine, just because a lot of it is going to be safety. You still want to be competitive but you don’t want to be the cheapest because you are also offering an amazing solution with this vending machine. A lot of safety, around the country, runs at around 30% margin.

Then you’ve got your huge customers. For your $50,000 to $100,000 a month customers, their margin is going to be less than 20%; you’re in the 15s. You’ve got some customers out there, like Intel, that will make you sign some sort of cost plus 10% deal. They want to know your cost and you can only charge 10%. If you don’t want it, don’t do business with them.

### What is the assortment, typically, in vending? If it’s mainly safety, what is the other part of the mix?

We start off and push with all of our Body Guard gloves and glasses. That is the easiest way to get in, initially. Your HSE managers – health, safety and environmental managers – want to be able to track that stuff. They want to make sure that their employees have 24/7 access to safety products when there is an incident or something happens. Firstly, hopefully those incidents go away because there is 24/7 access to this type of stuff. If there is something and the employee complains, for instance, that he didn’t have the right gloves, well they’re right here in the vending machine; it says cut gloves. Why didn’t you get the cut gloves? It opens up those conversations and it protects the company. Every eye injury is about a $10,000 bill. Everyone wants their employees to go home safe and sound every day.

### Who is the buyer of the vending machines; as a branch manager, who do you sell to?

You would sell to the operations manager. If you can get all the way up to VP, President and CEO and talk about the P&L part of it, all the better. When you go and sell it to the warehouse guy, 90% of the time they hate you because you’re taking away their job. We’ve had customers where we go and do a presentation and the eyes of the bigwigs are huge and they can see that the savings on this is unbelievable. We tell the customer that you are going to see an average of 30% savings, when we know it’s way more than that. We’re not going to tell them they are going to save 50% or 60% because we’re hoping that they don’t save that much but, in the long run, that’s what we started to notice.

After one of these presentations, we walked out and the warehouse guy followed us out and said, “Don’t ever bring that crap in here again; I don’t want to see it. You’re taking away my job.” We have to sell it to them and explain that we’re not trying to take away their job. We are taking away the crappy part of their job. Do you really enjoy standing here and passing out gloves, drill bits and doing all that, all day long as well as trying to track it all? Could you not be more useful driving around the forklift and the big stuff and not dealing with all these miniscule jobs of passing stuff out?

Granted, if the bigwigs decided to get rid of that position, that’s not our goal. We don’t want to get rid of anybody’s job. The higher up the food chain you can get to sell it, the easier it is to sell.

### Which customers do you think vending does not suit?

Most customers need to have some sort of safety program; it doesn’t matter who they are. The number of employees mattered, so maybe if they’re not processing anything and they only have less than four employees. I sold two vending machines; Fastenal came up with a smaller vending machine. They had a bigger one that was the coil machine and then they came out with the FAST 2000. It has less products, less cost to build, less money you needed to spend a month. I think it was for company size of about 11 employees, with four or five guys in the warehouse that were helping build windows. We got it in there and they loved it.

If they had less employees than that and they weren’t really going through that much stuff, it is maybe not worth it to them. They’re not going to spend $1,500 a month on safety and other products.

### Management say that they think, potentially, that 1.7 million machines could be installed in the very long run. They’re only at about 90,000 today. It seems as if there is a huge runway.

I remember seeing the video, internally, at Fastenal, for the 50,000th machine that was installed.

### So in your opinion, there are not many limitations in terms of growing vending, if they can also change the size of the machine, reduce the spend and be useful for a company with 10 employees. That covers pretty much every manufacturing business globally.

Any manufacturing business should definitely have one.

### How does it change your economics, as a branch manager? Let’s say you do $24,000 a year in spend, 40% gross margin, $10,000 gross profit, what are the inventory turns on that and how does it impact your branch gross profit?

The inventory turns go up. The one thing, at the beginning of this, that I think they didn’t see happening was the time suck. There is so much time spent on this behind the scenes. We call it the machine behind the machine. Fastenal has done a great job of just trying to help that over time. Before, you didn’t have vending-ready product. You would get gloves in, you sit there, turn them inside out, put a rubber band around them. A pallet of stuff arrives, half of it is for vending and so you’re going to spend the next two hours packaging product.

It was the old way of pulling the report, looking at what you need, going and pulling all that stuff. They started from multiple access points to try to make it more efficient. They started demanding from our suppliers – and internally – that there are two part numbers. There is a part number where it comes as a pack of 12 gloves and then there is a part number where it is a vending-ready product. It started having a V at the end of the part number so you knew that it was vending-ready, which was amazing. It comes shrink-wrapped, with the information right on it and you can just go.

I never saw the hubs in action, but I got a tour of one of them where they were doing pick-to-light. It was a vending hub, in Indianapolis. They had their main big distribution hub and then then, across the parking lot, they had a brand-new hub just for vending. Everything that went through there was going to be vending-ready. The machines would send the report of what they need. The people in the hub would pull everything, throw it in a box – this is vending machine 7476, for this customer – put a label on it, it goes on the pallet and shows up the next morning.

That was the great thing about Fastenal; you could order stuff at 5:00PM and you would have it, in your branch, at 7:00AM the next day. Because of that, they were trying to make vending that way, to where you would run the report at night and, the next morning, here are the three vending machines I’ve got to go and fill up.

### It comes from a distribution center rather than your branch?

Yes, so it takes the time away from the branch. They were always trying to find ways to make it more efficient. If you got to 10 vending machines, you needed a vending machine person; you needed a new employee. The good part was that it was growing employment for people but is that really what we want to pay people to do, package vending products all day?

As long as it was more of going to fill the machines – fill and bill – great, let’s hire someone to do that. But let’s not hire someone to sit in the background and package stuff all day.

### How did you see the customer behavior change when vending was installed? Did they spend more money on other stuff?

For a lot of customers, we didn’t even have to ask them what else we could put in the vending machine; they started coming to us. They go and grab something out of a box and they’re out of it, even though they go down to Home Depot and buy cases of duct tape. They come to us and they don’t even care that it is going to be more expensive; they just want it in the machine. They don’t have time to manage that anymore.

Like you said, total cost of ownership is down because it’s in a machine. They started noticing that and so customers will come to you, looking for more stuff to put in there.

### Isn’t there a limitation to what you can actually fit into a vending machine?

I remember seeing pictures of a place in Washington which was a huge fabrication company that has six-foot bandsaw blades. They got lockers that were six-foot tall and put bandsaw blades in there.

### So Fastenal can be adaptive and flexible in terms of what the lockers, bins or machines look like?

We manufacture bandsaw blades to whatever size you need, so that became a big sell. We were talking earlier about [[Walmart]] who didn’t actually vend anything out of those lockers; they were just paying us to use them. We also had really small lockers; three inches tall by a foot across. They are two feet deep but you just put little things in there. I had a customer who loved the trackability of vending. You could see when tools or anything else was checked out. He wanted to do a checkout for his scissor lift, his chop saw and all these huge tools.

I went over one day, helped him for three hours, as a Fastenal outside sales rep, to help him build these huge wooden lockers that you just slid the saw into. They put padlocks and wire around the tool and just locked everything up. The scissor lift was locked to a pole. They then put keys, for each one of those, with a little wooden dowel with a number on it, in the locker. Employee XYZ walks up and they can track when they took it. $1,500, $2,000, $10,000 tools are no longer disappearing. Will I pay you $500 a month to have that locker so my stuff doesn’t disappear? Heck, yes, I will. The possibilities are endless when you think about it.

### When a customer comes to you and requests a certain product to be in a vending machine, is it Fastenal that can adapt the lockers, the bins, the vending machines to that customer specifically?

Obviously, 90% of the time we want to sell you whatever we can through there; we want to generate revenue. But yes, we want to think about solutions. It is called FAST Solutions for the vending program. Our goal was always to come up with solutions for our customers. This is your problem; how do we solve it? Can we use vending to sort it out? Now they have FAST PODs. They are literally a CONEX which has been turned into a room with vending in it. You have a construction site where we can pick this thing up, drop it on your construction site. It’s got AC, a heater, Wi-Fi; you’ve just got to plug it in somewhere on your job site or have a generator and your guys can go in here and get products 24/7. We can come and fill it up whenever we need to. They are really thinking outside the box in terms of how they can get them everywhere.

### Why can’t competitors replicate this vending strategy?

I think they’re trying but they’re just behind the 8 ball. The other issue is that Fastenal has got such a great distribution network. We’re one of the only companies in that market – compared to Grainger, MSC and all those other companies – where we have our own distribution; we have our own trucking. We need to get products from our Indianapolis hub to our hub up in Washington and it takes two days. We order on Monday and it gets up to the hub on Wednesday and I get it in my branch on Thursday. There are so many cost savings when we do that internally, instead of having to use UPS.

The same thing applies when it comes to the vending part of it. Getting these vending machines all over the country where we need them, when we need them; buying the vending machine manufacturer and then working with them on new designs. I think we’re so far ahead. Can they catch up at some point? I’ve seen plenty of Grainger machines. MSC has lots of machines for the cutting tip world; they market just around there. Eventually, we can get that business. They’re out there, but they’re well behind.

I think we’ve got the machine behind the machine going so well that people don’t want to wait for the competitors to figure it out.

### What is the secret of that machine behind the machine?

I think that’s the large group at corporate, the conversations with managers and the people in the field, about how you become more efficient. They’re always working on that. There is a guy, John Soderberg, who was head of IT when I left and, before that, he was another VP and the guy is phenomenal. I wouldn’t say that if he left, it goes away, but when it comes to IT and getting things out there, working with all the different moving pieces, Fastenal has just invested a lot of money and time into making sure it works right. We have our own IT specialist. I think there is a Fastenal IT building with programmers, 24/7. There are people in the US and we’ve got a group in Thailand. I know John would have to fly over there every couple of months. When we need something done, we get it programmed overnight and we’re trying to use it the next day. It’s fast reaction and a lot of money. I think they put $100 million into vending, when I first started; nobody else was doing that.

### Grainger, for example, use third party carriers to ship the product to the machines so it’s a longer lead time and not as quick as Fastenal?

Correct.

### I was reading the Fastenal 2018 investor day earlier, and one of the comments around why vending can’t be replicated by a competitor really stood out to me. The quote was “the competitors just haven’t put enough investment into the quality of the service so that means the final delivery, the systems and this machine behind the machine seems to be much more efficient than other companies”. My question is do you think the advantage also stems from the history of the company where the fastener business drives such a high gross margin at the group level that, actually, Fastenal can afford to pay and own the full process that gives a much better experience to the customer than other competitors, who don’t have a 50% gross margin?

I totally agree. You mentioned the customer experience a few times and, even in my position in my company now, that is the one main focus. Safety for our customers is number one at our company and, after that, it’s customer experience; how do you improve it? It starts from all the different processes. It’s about ways to keep each other accountable; monitoring our quality control and our prices. Are we competitive? I don’t want to be the cheapest in town. You can drive the Pinto or you can drive the BMW. They’re both going to get you there but one of them sure feels a lot nicer and a lot more reliable.

### What do you think is the biggest challenge for Fastenal to keep on growing the vending installations?

When you’re at a branch and you feel as if you have already asked all your customers and you don’t know who else to ask, that’s one challenge. Another was the time factor. I don’t have time for any more vending machines, so people aren’t trying to sell them. Just getting people past that mental break of not knowing who else to sell to. I’m sure, at the Fastenal School of Business, they have come up with more training on who else to sell to. Case studies were awesome because you could watch that and get ideas.

When you saw how vending was used everywhere else, then you start to get ideas. “I didn’t even think about putting vending at the Staples down the street; I didn’t know that they had four warehouse guys and go through a lot of safety.” Little things where you would think you would never sell to that kind of person that are right there, that actually do buy a lot of product. The biggest hurdle is really getting the information into the bottom line of all the sales reps. Once they get it, they get it; it’s easy. It’s just getting them to that point.

It’s a hurdle but it’s not a hurdle that Fastenal is not always working on and getting there. As it grows, you get more and more case studies to share. They start to hear more and more about different avenues that we are selling vending into. The customers help us sell it too. They bring in all these different thoughts about how to use our own vending machine that we haven’t even thought of. Then we can start saying, I didn’t even think about doing that; let’s try and do that with everybody. You even go back to your old customers and say, hey, you’ve got all these vending machines but what about one where you just did check in and check out of all these tools that you lose all the time?

One of them was first aid kits. You put a first aid kit in the vending machine and, if someone gets hurt, they go and check out the kit. As soon as they check it out, it sends an email to your health and safety director and then they can create an incident report. Now we’re tracking some of that stuff even better. Just little things like that probably came from a customer. You’ve got to share that because how many people in the company don’t know it? It is just about sharing information.

### There are so many different permutations of how this could be used, when you are on the site of the customer.

Correct.
