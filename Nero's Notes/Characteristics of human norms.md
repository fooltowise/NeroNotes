The threat of some kind of punishment must always be present, or a "norm" is little more than hot air. "Covenant without the sword are but words."

The essence of a [[Norms|norm]], then, lies not in the words we use to describe it, but in which behaviors get punished and what form the punishment takes.

Collective enforcement is crucial. If you refrain from hitting people because you're afraid they'll hit you back, that's not a norm. If you're afraid of speaking out against a dangerous regime because you're worried about retaiation from the regime itself, that's not a norm. But if you're worried that your neighbors might disapprove and even coordinate to punish you, then you're most likely dealing with a norm. **It's this thirdparty, collective enforcement that's unique to humans.**
