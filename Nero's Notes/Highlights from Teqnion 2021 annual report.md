## Word from the CEO

### We hold in

Last year I wrote here that we had not included the risk of pandemic in our foresight when Teqnion was founded in 2006. Now I have to admit that we didn't include the risk of war in Europe either. So despite having to deal with a lot of pest infestations over the last two years, we are all now facing something much more dire. A Russian regime of compact darkness sending missiles to kill civilians. We have to adjust to living under a real military threat. My grandfather was drafted for three years in the 1940s and was on the Finnish border. I never even imagined that I would have to live under similar conditions, that it could be me or my children. Let us rejoice and find strength in the solidarity and massive support for the Ukrainian people shown by the Western world. We support Ukraine in its struggle for freedom and demand that those responsible end the war immediately. слава україна!
What we can focus on is being good in our everyday lives. Doing our jobs and being ready to face all kinds of challenges. Teqnion is made up of people and companies that are great at dealing with difficulties and quick turnarounds. We get on with it and do what needs to be done. Teqnion continues to grow, make more money, become more robust and we never intend to stop. It's in our DNA.

### Better than ever LEAVE IT!

Many colleagues in the group have struggled during the year with rising material prices and logistical problems, but still managed to do extremely well, which is reflected in our profit growth and cash flow. We love cash flow. Our business can only be sustainable if we are good at always growing earnings and cash flow. Then we give ourselves the ability to confidently grow our companies, the peace of mind to make the right decisions, to hire new, driven colleagues and to continue acquiring nice profit machines for subsidiaries. A very important (read: most important), simple and perhaps somewhat overlooked aspect of running profitable companies is that employees are happy. It's fun to work if the company is making good money. There is crystal clear feedback that the work matters and is producing results. We want to have fun
at work. So profit growth is what we chase. And achieving it. Our 2021 was amazing, but we're never satisfied. We're never done. We keep building towards the horizon. Now extra vigilant.

### Feel the pulse

Because we have a well differentiated group of companies, or to put it more clearly, a wonderfully diversified business across many technology niches, we have the advantage of being able to sense where things are heading early on when new trends emerge. Our colleagues, who operate in many different sectors, take support from each other and from us in management to be able to react quickly and counteract anything that challenges them. The power and resilience of having many people who want to be good, who know a lot and who have a wide network of contacts adds real value. Decisions are made quickly in the businesses when we have real trust in each other. We never stand alone, we have each other's backs. The sense of belonging is strong. The desire to help is even stronger. Because then we always ensure profitable growth.

### New financial targets, same old net
My goal with Teqnion is continued profitable growth. This requires our subsidiaries to offer workplaces where people can develop and thrive. Where we want to be our best and trigger each other to always strive forward. Teqnion is becoming more resilient as the existing companies continue to develop and through frequent, smart acquisitions. We are creating strong value growth that should make shareholders happy. To build big over the long term, the foundations must be solid. That's why we set a target to ensure that we do not have too much debt in relation to our earnings. Then, of course, the walls of the building must be thick, carry a lot and and withstand shaky times. This is ensured by a target that requires high margins in the deal. With a solid foundation of low leverage, thick walls of profitable business, we can focus our efforts towards building the roof to the sky through the goal of growing earnings per share. We can best do this by continuing to acquire earnings machines at reasonable valuations. The cash flow from our businesses is reinvested in new cash flows that are invested in new cash flows... Our goal is to double earnings per share every five years. Easy at first, so it's good that we get to practice, because if we keep that target, it will be a substantial company value after a man's lifetime. The house drawing shows... profitable growth!
(P.S. About the house... if the above text made you want a new house and you have the luxury of living in Blekinge or Småland. Do not hesitate to contact Hem1 or Grimstorp Building Components. Say hello from me and I'll give you an extra housewarming present.)


### Do you have a nice company? We buy! 

The Teqnion Group continues to grow as we continually seek out and acquire great entrepreneurial technology companies. Daniel and I travel around and meet inspiring company builders several times a week. We learn something new from everyone we meet. I guess we have the most fun job there is and in our meetings we see so clearly that there is hope in the world. All those driven struggling one- three entrepreneurs who don't fold and who do good things every day. They create jobs and tax revenues that ensure strong communities. Entrepreneurship is the lifeblood of us all. Entrepreneurs are our heroes. Please call us and tell us about any entrepreneur or company you think we should check out. We want to be more.

### Everyday life is ours

Today, of course, many people are worried about the future. Inflation, interest rate rises and war. Those are three words I'd rather not write here. But they are realities now. That's why we must manage to stay focused on something we can influence. Our daily routines and jobs are something to hold on to. The job gives us a clear purpose and together we build a functioning life. We in Teqnion intend to continue to be good in our everyday lives. We will keep on improving because we aim to build the best team in the world, building the best company in the world. We intend to keep moving forward and upward because no other option is relevant. Take care of each other and don't forget to smile. It helps.

## Strategy

Teqnion's value creation is based on a two-pronged growth strategy that puts business first and people first.

### Vision
Teqnion's vision is to become a leading industrial group in the Nordic region through organic growth and acquisitions.
### Business concept
Teqnion's business concept is to build a diversified group of companies by acquiring quality companies with favourable prospects. The companies are further developed through a continued focus on entrepreneurship combined with Teqnion's industry experience, network of contacts and financial resources.

### Business model

Teqnion's business model is based on acquiring healthy and established niche companies with high technology content and strong market positions. The subsidiaries consist of agency operations representing leading brands, product and service companies developing unique solutions to specific industry niches and manufacturing industries that sells products under own or customer brands.
A well-balanced mix of businesses in different market niches is an important component in building a diversified and robust group of companies. The business model is based on decentralised governance where subsidiaries operate independently to maintain an entrepreneurial spirit and a high level of commitment and competence among the management and employees of each company. Teqnion contributes with strategy work, organisational development and financial resources.


## Growth strategy

Teqnion's strength lies in its structured way of working combined with a driven management team and an experienced board. Continued growth is based on two strategies.
- Acquisition strategy: growth through the acquisition of sound companies with verified potential.
- Corporate development strategy: continuous work towards optimised operations to create the conditions for good earnings growth in the subsidiaries.

### ACQUISITION STRATEGY

We look for niche companies that are driven by enthusiasts and where employees are skilled and proud of what they do. These companies have a secure track record, high profitability, good cash flows and favourable prospects. Our geographic focus has been Sweden, but now we have also started to look for good companies in other markets and the feeling is that we have a high hit rate so far. We meet up to 200 new companies annually and we expect to acquire more than five in the current year. Because we meet a lot of companies, we have the opportunity to be very careful about what we choose to go forward with. Extremely few acquisition prospects pass our needle eye to screening process and end up in a subsidiary acquisition.

Examples of acquisition criteria considered:
- Talented management who are motivated to continue to grow the business and organization.
- Companies that operate in a clearly defined industry niche and over the years have built deep moats that are difficult to replicate by potential competitors.
- Long-term and good relationships with employees, customers and suppliers.
- Profitability that can withstand development and integration.
- Sustainable prospects.
- Stable turnover of 25-150 MSEK. - Profitability above our financial target. - Strong cash flows.

### CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

Teqnion's subsidiaries operate in narrow technology niches where the specific expertise lies with the employees in the subsidiaries. Teqnion's philosophy and strategy therefore focuses on decentralised decision-making where development is always based on the subsidiaries' individual strategies. It is our portfolio companies that create competitive advantage by being fast and flexible with short decision paths, unique offerings and good relationships through the companies' employees and their customers. Teqnion does not manage from the top. We are there to support from the side.
Teqnion's central management function adds value through support and structure to the independent subsidiaries. Teqnion has also developed policies and processes to make it easy for organisations that lack sufficiently clear ways of working in a particular area to be strengthened. Teqnion is particularly focused on ensuring that its subsidiaries are managed by competent leaders who, together with their employees, are driven to develop the companies with a strong customer focus.

## Market

The majority of Teqnion's sales are in the Nordic region, with Sweden as the main market, but with some exceptions that are constantly growing. Teqnion's aim is to increase the proportion of international sales in a few years' time, thereby reducing the risk of being heavily dependent on a single market. Teqnion's sales are made partly by our subsidiaries selling products to our industrial customers and partners, and partly by using distributors or wholesale companies to reach out with our offerings.

### Trends and drivers

Teqnion seeks to acquire and develop healthy subsidiaries with good prospects in different industries and with geographical spread to create a diversified industrial group.
Demand for the subsidiaries' products and services is influenced by the underlying market potential of each subsidiary's market niche. There are therefore many different trends and underlying drivers affecting the markets in which Teqnion's subsidiaries operate. Some of the trends affecting the group of companies include:
- Life expectancy is increasing while there are higher demands for active and meaningful ageing.
- Housing shortages create demands for house building. This should be done with little environmental impact and as energy efficient as possible.
- The transition to a more electrified society requires investment in infrastructure, control and safety.
- Rail transport will play a greater role in a sustainable society.
- An uncertain world calls for defence reinforcement and training in the defence branches.

### CONTINUED GOOD ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES

Growing through acquisitions is the central part of Teqnion's strategy. Teqnion's growth opportunities are thus influenced by the availability of interesting acquisition targets. It is our view that the availability of sound companies to acquire is very good and new ones are being added continuously as new companies are founded, grow and mature.
This will enable Teqnion to continue to grow through acquisitions in the future. We intend to improve geographical risk diversification by acquiring companies outside Sweden. This will of course further increase the acquisition opportunities.

### GLOBALLY LOW INTEREST RATES

Globally low interest rates are affecting companies like Teqnion. As interest rates have been at low levels for a long period of time, this has enabled increased acquisition capacity for both Teqnion and similar acquisition-driven companies... Cheap debt financing has therefore in some cases contributed to an increase in the prices of acquisition targets. As interest rates may rise in the long term, this may affect companies with high levels of debt, both among acquiring companies and among acquisition targets. Teqnion's target is that the debt-to-equity ratio should not exceed 2.5x adjusted EBITDA for the last
12 months. This is to ensure that the company has the capacity to acquire attractive companies even in a higher interest rate environment.

### Competitive situation and risks

Teqnion's business is partially exposed to competition from companies with a similar strategy. Examples of similar companies with a sound acquisition strategy are Indutrade, [[Lifco]] and [[Lagercrantz]] Group. However, the competitive situation is very limited but naturally places high demands on Teqnion's organisation and management.

Teqnion often acquires companies that have been in the lower range of what the company's larger competitors usually acquire. This type of acquisition involves both opportunities and risks. The opportunities arise from the fact that the companies often have a high growth potential and that there may be less competition for them when fewer players are interested. The risks are that the organisation of these smaller companies is not as robust as that of a larger company and that the product offering may be somewhat limited.

## Activities

Teqnion is a group of companies consisting of 21 operating subsidiaries in three business areas.

### Business areas
**Industry**: companies offering well-established industrial products and production methods with a high degree of customisation.
**Growth**: companies with high growth potential and the possibility of a large geographical spread.
**Niche**: Companies with high knowledge of products, regulations and applications in narrow market niches.


## Industry

The companies in the Industry business area specialise in the manufacture of unique products or the supply of customer-specific industrial supplies. In these companies, the key to profitability lies in efficient processes, both in terms of production and administration.

**Interview Christer Hultgren,** CEO and former owner of Cutting Metal Works in Valdemarsvik.
**Company**: Cutting Metal Works i Valdemarsvik (CMW) Part of Teqnion since 2021
**Industry** niche: Chip cutting machining
In the archipelago idyll of Valdemarsvik lies the recently acquired industrial company CMW. As the name reveals, the business is niche in chip-cutting machining of components, with high demands on dimensional accuracy, for well-known global industrial customers. Christer Hultgren, CEO, with business partner Richard Karlström sold the company to Teqnion in 2021.

Christer was born and raised in Valdersmarsvik, where he lives with his partner and has two grown-up children. Boating and the archipelago are a great interest, as is his love for the local area, where he plays an active role in the local business community. Christer has many strings to his bow and is also a talented drummer who played in several dance bands (Titanix & Scratch) before his industrial career took over.
The decision to sell the company was taken when Richard, ten years older, wanted to retire. The process of meeting potential buyers began where Teqnion with CEO Johan stood out from the crowd with its sound values and that Teqnion was made up of "ordinary good people". The assurance that the company would remain in Valdemarsvik and continue to be a significant and long-term employer was also crucial for the sale to go through.
Christer has continued as CEO, and with his newfound energy, he has no plans to step down. Since Teqnion became owner, the company has enjoyed very strong growth and is doing better than ever. Christer feels that he is not working any harder than before, but that he gets a kick out of having so many new colleagues in the Teqnion team that he can have as "sparring partners".

**Interview Niklas Wallman**, CEO and former owner of Wallmek in Kungälv.
**Company**: Wallmek i Kungälv
Part of Teqnion since 2021
**Industry niche:** Special tools for automotive workshops
A so-called "cold call" in early 2021 to CEO Niklas was the start of the sale of the family company Wallmek to Teqnion. After some follow-up calls, Niklas realized that he was starting to like Teqnion's approach to doing business and that Teqnion's approach differed in a very positive way from the other serial acquirers Niklas had been courted by over the years. Teqnion's truly decentralized business model suited his desire to continue to develop the company as he saw fit, and at the same time, the sale provided a personal security that gave him the courage to take the next step in Wallmek's development. During the first physical meeting at Wallmek's premises, CEO Johan and CXO Daniel went "undercover" as usual but in shirts from other subsidiaries which was intercepted by a co-worker who understood the connection and Niklas' thoughts on sales were revealed. The staff was thus involved in the acquisition process early on, allowing for a smooth and transparent process.
Niklas took over the company in the late 1990s from his father Leif, who had started the company two decades earlier. Niklas had previously worked as a design engineer at Ericsson. Something he took away from there was the importance of outsourcing low value-added activities in favour of focusing on high value-added processes.
Wallmek's tools are sold to both small and large workshops throughout Europe and North America. Niklas realised the value of marketing early on by showing videos where the products are pre-presented and demonstrated. A small TV studio is set up at the factory where demonstration films are recorded in Swedish, English and German. Customers often buy the tools just when they need them, so fast delivery is of paramount importance. Being really close to customers and listening to and understanding their needs are important parts of product development.
Last year, Niklas was named Entrepreneur of the Year in Kungälv. Selling to Teqnion has not made him slow down, but rather the opposite. Now that the corona era is hopefully over, Wallmek is aiming to focus more on exports and now also a little more on the American market.

The Niche business consists of subsidiaries that offer products and services in narrow and distinct market niches.

Teqnion focuses on keeping the organisations within these companies small and focused on high quality technology sales.


**Interview Johan Jönsson**, CEO and former owner of INNOGUARD.
 
**Company**: INNOGUARD, Part of Teqnion since 2021
**Industry niche**: Laboratory and medical devices
Teqnion got in touch in early 2021 with a request to buy the company. It was another subsidiary of the group that had become aware of INNOGUARD when they were doing business with each other. Johan declined at first, but after some time he changed his mind. Johan visualised the company's development in ten-year phases and now with two phases behind him he had started to plan for the next decade. Faced with this long-term journey, it felt increasingly attractive and, above all, more fun to have a larger team with more "sparring partners" with whom to work on ideas and strategies. Johan called Teqnion back after a few months and resumed the dialogue.
As a development engineer, Johan is driven by a great curiosity and enjoys it best when he gets to go out into the factory and develop new products. During the company's early years, he developed a sensor technology for self-flushing toilets with motion detectors and also other products in a touch-free range. After focusing on contract manufacturing of, among other things, laboratory equipment for many years, Johan started to develop a premium segment of laboratory equipment under his own brand INNOGUARD.
Johan has built up INNOGUARD by developing a concept rather than individual products. Just as Apple is more than a phone and Tesla is more than a car, INNOGUARD and its solutions are much more than just lab equipment. When customers choose INNOGUARD, it's not just because the products are of the highest quality, but because INNOGUARD offers a concept of bespoke, turnkey labs and a customer experience and after-sales service that sets them apart from all other suppliers.
The company slogan "Home of true innovators" came about when Johan was lecturing at an event. The moderator started to introduce the next guest who was a great entrepreneur and innovator and Johan was immediately curious what this exciting guest was that he would be listening to. It hadn't occurred to him that he was the one being introduced. Johan shares his passion for inventing and product development with many of his customers. Whether it's making dairy products from oats, building the world's best trucks or developing vaccines, INNOGUARD can deliver the best conditions for a safe and innovative lab environment.

### Auditor

Peter Åsheim, a certified public accountant, is the auditor in charge. Peter Åsheim is a member of FAR.

## Corporate governance

Corporate governance is designed to ensure that we operate Teqnion in a sustainable, responsible and efficient manner. Clear corporate governance helps to ensure confidence in Teqnion and increases the focus on business value and shareholder value in the company. Teqnion's corporate governance is based on the Swedish Companies Act, the Articles of Association, the Nasdaq First North Growth Markets regulations, the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance and internal rules and regulations.

### Swedish Code of Corporate Governance
The Swedish Code of Corporate Governance (the "Code"), which is available at www.bolagsstyrning.se, shall be applied by companies whose shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market. Teqnion is not formally covered by the Code as its shares are listed on Nasdaq OMX First North Growth Market but has chosen to apply the Code as from 2021.
Compliance with the Swedish Corporate Governance Code
The Company deviates from the Code in the following respects:
- The Board has no formal committees such as audit and remuneration committees, but has chosen to have the full Board represented on these matters.
- An investment committee has been established with two representatives from the Board as well as the CEO, CFO and CXO. No written rules of procedure have been established.
- No formal internal control function has been established. TEQ staff works closely with the subsidiaries through active Board work and in accounting and financial reporting. The staff monitors the financial and operational reporting on a monthly basis and makes controls as deemed relevant. In addition, the Group has several common policies, a financial manual and governance documents.
- The Board has not annually evaluated the need for internal audit. As the company has chosen not to have a formal internal control process, the discussion of internal audit has not been relevant.
- As the Board and the Company have not established a formal internal control function, such work is not described in this Corporate Governance Report.
- The Board has chosen not to have the auditor review the Group's half-yearly or nine-monthly report. This is because the Board considers that annual review is sufficient.
- The Board has not met annually with the auditor without the CEO and CFO being present. The Board intends to start complying with the recommendation of the Code.
- Two members of the Board of Directors were elected as auditors of the General Meeting. The reason for this was the extremely limited number of external participants due to Corona.

### Compliance with applicable stock exchange rules
There were no violations of applicable stock exchange rules during the financial year 2021.
### Significant events in 2021
At the Annual General Meeting of 20 April 2021, a resolution was passed

### Nomination Committee
Composition of the Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee shall consist of representatives of the three largest registered shareholders in terms of votes in the share register maintained by Euroclear as of the last banking day
of September each year. The Chairman of the Board shall convene the Nomination Committee for its first meeting. The member representing the largest shareholder in terms of votes shall be appointed as chairman of the Nomination Committee, unless the members of the Nomination Committee agree otherwise. The Chairman of the Board or any other member of the Board shall not be the Chairman of the Nomination Committee. The Chief Executive Officer or any other member of Teqnion's management shall not be a member of the Nomination Committee. The composition of the Nomination Committee shall be made public as soon as they are appointed. The term of office of the Nomination Committee shall be until a new Nomination Committee is appointed.

Shareholders who have appointed a representative as a member of the Nomination Committee have the right to dismiss such member and appoint a new representative as a member of the Nomination Committee. For the the event that, during the term of office of the Nomination Committee, a shareholder is no longer one of the three largest shareholders in terms of voting rights, the member appointed by such shareholder shall make his seat available and the shareholder who has joined the three largest shareholders in terms of voting rights may appoint his representative. However, unless there are special reasons, no changes shall be made in the composition of the Nomination Committee if only marginal changes in the number of votes have taken place or if the change occurs later than two months before the Annual General Meeting. Any change in the composition of the Nomination Committee shall be published immediately.



Tasks of the Nomination Committee
No remuneration shall be paid to the members of the Nomination Committee. Any necessary expenses for the work of the Nomination Committee shall be borne by Teqnion and Teqnion is obliged, at the request of the Nomination Committee, to provide human resources such as secretarial function in the Nomination Committee to facilitate the work of the Nomination Committee. The Nomination Committee shall carry out tasks including, inter alia, making proposals to the Chairman of the Meeting, the Board of Directors, the Chairman of the Board, the auditors, the Board fee with a split between the Chairman and each of the other members and remuneration for any committee work, the fee to Teqnion's auditors and,
to the extent deemed necessary, proposals for amendments to these Terms of Reference.

### The Board and its work
#### Tasks of the Board
The Board of Directors is the second highest decision-making body after the General Meeting. According to the Companies Act, the Board is responsible for Teqnion's organisation and management
of Teqnion's affairs, which means that the Board is responsible for, among other things, setting goals and strategies, ensuring procedures and systems for evaluating the goals set, continuously evaluating the financial position and performance, and evaluating the operational management. The Board is also responsible for ensuring that annual and interim reports are prepared in a timely manner. In addition, the Board appoints the Executive Director.

#### Composition of the Board
Directors are appointed by the Annual General Meeting for the period ending at the next Annual General Meeting. According to Teqnion's Articles of Association, the number of Directors elected by the Annual General Meeting shall be not less than three (3) and not more than ten (10). Currently, the Board of Directors consists of six (6) ordinary directors, all of whom were re-elected at the 2021 AGM.

#### Rules of Procedure
The Board follows written rules of procedure which are revised annually and adopted by the constituent Board meeting each year. The Rules of Procedure govern, inter alia, the practices, functions and division of labour between the members of the Board and the Executive Director. At the inaugural Board meeting, the Board also adopts instructions for the Executive Director, including instructions for financial reporting. Where the Management Board sets up committees within itself, the rules of procedure of the Management Board shall set out the tasks and decision-making powers delegated by the Management Board to the committees, as well as the reporting arrangements of the committees to the Management Board.

#### Role of the Chairperson
The chairman is responsible for organising and directing the work of the board so that it is carried out in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act, other laws and regulations, stock market laws and regulations and internal policies and governance documents. The chairman is responsible for monitoring the company's activities through regular contact with the CEO and for ensuring that the other members receive adequate information and decision-making support.
The Chairperson shall lead the annual evaluation of the Board's work and composition. In 2021, a survey and individual interviews with members were conducted. The results have been discussed by the Board and presented to the Nomination Committee.

#### Work of the Board in 2021
According to the Board's rules of procedure, the Board shall meet at the inaugural Board meeting, in connection with the submission of interim reports and the annual report, and at four ordinary Board meetings, which evaluate the following themes: evaluation, strategy, risk management and budget. The number of Board meetings in 2021 was 9 and the attendance is shown in the table below:
- Approval of internal policies.
- Strategic direction.
- Capital structure and financing of activities.
- Financial targets and dividend policy.
- Monitoring of operations, financial performance, formation, audit and organisational matters.
- approval of interim reports, financial statements and annual report
- Review and report by the company's auditor.
- Board evaluation and evaluation of the Executive Director.
- Acquisition of new businesses.
- Incentive and option schemes.

### Audit and Remuneration Committee
The Board of Directors has assessed that, in view of the scope of Teqnion's operations and its size, it is not currently justified to set up special committees for audit and remuneration issues, but that these issues are dealt with by the Board of Directors.

### Internal control and audit
Under the Companies Act, the Board of Directors has overall responsibility for ensuring that Teqnion's organisation is designed to provide adequate control over its accounting, cash management and other financial affairs. Teqnion's internal control structure is based on the division of labour between the Board and the CEO. The CEO is responsible for ensuring that good internal control and formalised procedures are in place to ensure the reliability of external financial reporting and that this is in accordance with applicable accounting principles, applicable laws and other requirements for listed companies. Teqnion has a simple legal and operational structure in which the Board of Directors continuously monitors Teqnion's internal control in relation to external and internal financial reporting. Against this background, the Board has chosen not to establish a specific internal control function.

### Auditor
According to Teqnion's Articles of Association, one (1) or two (2) auditors, with or without deputy auditors, shall be appointed by the Annual General Meeting. The auditor and deputy auditor, in
All meetings followed an approved agenda and understand distributed well in advance of the meeting. Ordinary Board meetings are usually half-day meetings. In addition to the Board, the CFO attends as secretary and, when necessary, other senior executives from TEQstab. The Board has discussed the following during its 2021 Board meetings: where applicable, shall be elected annually at the Annual General Meeting until the next Annual General Meeting is held. The role of the auditor is to audit Teqnion's annual accounts and financial statements and the management of the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer. After each financial year, the auditor shall submit an audit report to the General Meeting. The auditor examines Teqnion's annual accounts, consolidated accounts and bookkeeping as well as the management of the Board of Directors and the CEO.

### The Managing Director
The CEO is responsible for the day-to-day management of the company. Measures which, in view of the scope and nature of Teqnion's activities, are of an unusual nature or major significance fall outside the scope of day-to-day management and must therefore be prepared and presented to the Board for decision. The work and role of the CEO and the division of labour between the Board and the CEO are set out in written instructions issued by the Board (so-called CEO instructions). The Board evaluates the work of the CEO on an ongoing basis.

### Remuneration of the Board of Directors, the auditor and senior executives
#### Remuneration of Board members
Fees and other remuneration for the members of the Board of Directors, including the Chairman, are determined at the Annual General Meeting. At the Annual General Meeting on 20 April 2021, it was resolved that Board fees shall be paid in the amount of SEK 220,000 to the Chairman and SEK 140,000 to each of the other members who are not employees of the company.
#### Remuneration of auditors
The auditor's remuneration is determined at the Annual General Meeting. At the Annual General Meeting on 20 April 2021, it was resolved that the auditor's fee shall be paid in accordance with the approved invoice.
#### Cash-based incentive schemes
In addition to fixed salary, the CEO of Teqnion, other senior executives and key employees may
of the parent company and managing directors of the subsidiaries, may receive a variable salary upon the achievement of one or more pre-determined and measurable performance targets set by the Board of Directors. In order to avoid undue risk-taking, there should be a basic balance between fixed and variable remuneration. The fixed salary should be in line with market conditions and should also represent a sufficiently high proportion of the executive's total remuneration to allow the setting of
the variable part to zero. Any variable component may amount to a maximum of nine months' salary for the CEO of Teqnion and to a maximum of six months' salary for other senior executives, key employees and CEOs of subsidiaries. By linking the level of variable remuneration to performance targets, they promote the execution of the company's business strategy, long-term value creation and shareholders' interests. The conditions and calculation bases for variable remuneration shall be determined for each financial year. Compliance with criteria for the payment of
variable remuneration shall be measurable over a period of one financial year. Variable remuneration shall be settled in the year following its accrual.

#### Managing Director Teqnion
Variable remuneration for the Chief Executive Officer of Teqnion is calculated as 3% of the difference between the profit for the year before tax and the average profit before tax
for the last three years. The calculation excludes extraordinary income and expenses such as reversal of earn-out payments and impairment of goodwill. The maximum variable salary is nine (9) months' salary and is not pensionable.
Senior executives and other key employees of the parent company
Variable remuneration for all senior executives (CFO) and other key employees of the parent company, totalling five (5) persons, amounts in total to 3% of the difference between the profit for the year before tax and the average profit before tax for the last three years. The amount constituting the bonus pool is divided among the participants. The calculation excludes extraordinary income and expenses such as the reversal of additional purchase consideration and the impairment of goodwill. The maximum variable salary is six (6) months and is not pensionable.

#### Subsidiary CEO
All subsidiary CEOs have the possibility of a variable remuneration, with the exception of those subsidiary CEOs who are also former owners of the subsidiaries and are therefore subject to the possibility of additional purchase price payments. A precondition for the payment of a variable salary is that the annual result (profit before tax) is positive. The variable salary is calculated on the basis of predetermined measurable targets related to the pre-tax result before any bonus costs for the CEO and before unbudgeted year-end disposals. The maximum variable salary is six (6) months' salary and is not pensionable.

### Long-term incentive programs
At the end of the financial year, Teqnion had three outstanding stock option plans for a total of 177,500 shares.
The purpose of the programmes is to give key employees within the Group an opportunity to participate in and contribute to the positive development of the value of the company's shares through their own investment. The programmes are designed to create the conditions for recruiting and retaining competent staff in the Group, to offer competitive remuneration and to reconcile the interests of shareholders and key personnel.

















## Management report
The Board of Directors and the Managing Director of Teqnion AB, 556713-4183 hereby present the Annual Report for the financial year 2021-01-01 - 2021-12-31. Comparisons in brackets refer to the corresponding period of the previous year unless otherwise stated. Amounts in running text are presented in millions of Swedish kronor, MSEK, unless otherwise stated and amounts in tables are presented in thousands of Swedish kronor, kSEK, unless otherwise stated.

Teqnion does not exceed the size requirements under ÅRL 6:10 for the requirement to prepare a sustainability report, but has nevertheless chosen to prepare a sustainability report that is separate from the Directors' Report but co-printed with the Annual Report and can be found on pages 32-35.

### Operations
Teqnion was founded in 2006 and focuses on narrow industry niches where the companies can have market-leading positions with their products and services. Customers are found in many different industries, with the majority in industry and infrastructure. The business model is based on growth through continuous acquisitions of well-established profitable industrial companies and through organic development of existing holdings. Teqnion has a decentralised structure where subsidiaries operate independently and have a strong entrepreneurial spirit. The majority of Teqnion's business is conducted in the Nordic region, with Sweden as the primary market. At the balance sheet date, Teqnion had 328 employees. The parent company is listed on Nasdaq First North Growth Market since 2019.
At the end of 2021, Teqnion consisted of twenty operations in the following three business areas:
Industry - offers well-established products and production methods in industry and construction with a high degree of customisation.
Growth - businesses that have high growth potential with a wide geographical spread.
Niche - possessing high knowledge of products, regulations and applications in narrow market niches.

### The year in brief
In 2021, Teqnion has continued to grow, organically with a growth of 12%, and through five new acquisitions. Profitability has increased both from existing businesses strengthening their margins and the majority of acquired companies contributing to margin growth.
During the year, Teqnion has procured new bank credit lines to finance future acquisitions. The credit facilities together with cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flow are expected to be able to finance acquisitions in 2022. Teqnion and its subsidiaries have implemented a cash pool to work more efficiently with their liquidity.
Teqnion has strengthened its TQ staff (employees of the parent company) with three additional people during the year. This is to be able to work and support the increasing number of subsidiaries and to have the capacity to acquire more companies.
In 2021, the following five companies were acquired:
- Cutting Metal Works i Valdemarsvik AB, March 
- Kema Storköksförsäljning AB, April
- Wallmek in Kungälv AB, September
- INNOGUARD (UGAB AB), October
- Vicky Teknik AB, November.

Teqnion and its subsidiaries have continued to be affected by the coronavirus in 2021. A year into the pandemic, social distancing, working from home and digital meetings became commonplace for many. The knock-on effects of the pandemic, which became increasingly evident, were increased raw material prices, component shortages and long delivery times. Most companies have managed to cope well, growing organically and improving profitability.

### Net sales and results
The Teqnion Group's net sales amounted to SEK 920.2 (659.1) million, an increase of 39.6% compared to the previous year. Acquired units in the Niche and Industry segment contributed SEK 181.9 million and organic growth amounted to 12.0%. The subsidiaries have been affected differently by the pandemic, with some companies more affected and losing sales and profitability, while others have not been affected much.
Depreciation and amortisation of intangible and tangible fixed assets amounted to SEK 35.8 (25.1) million during the period. Total depreciation of property, plant and equipment amounted to SEK 34.8 (24.5) million, of which SEK 28.6 (20.3) million is directly attributable to right-of-use assets.

EBITA amounted to SEK 105.6 (61.4) million and the EBITA margin was 11.5% (9.3%).

The adjusted EBITA margin increased year-on-year to 10.4% (8.1%).

The EBITA result increased to SEK 38.1 (14.5) million and the EBITA margin strengthened to 8.5% (4.6%). The improvement in results is mainly due to production efficiencies and acquired companies with higher profitability.

### Growth
Net sales for 2021 amounted to SEK 97.2 (85.9) million and growth, which was entirely organic, amounted to 13.2%. The EBITA result amounted to SEK 12.1 (13.4) million, giving an EBI- TA margin of 12.4% (15.7%). The segment includes operations that are largely project-driven, which explains the fluctuations in results.

### Niche
Net sales for 2021 amounted to SEK 376.9 (257.8) million, an increase of 46.2%. Acquired units contributed SEK 52.3 million and organic growth was -5.3%. EBITA result increased to SEK 56.6 (31.8) million and the EBITA margin was 15.0% (12.3%).

In addition, the undrawn part of the credit facility amounted to SEK 157m including the extension option. The Group's interest-bearing liabilities amounted to SEK 176.7 (114.2) million and, excluding lease liabilities relating to right-of-use assets, interest-bearing liabilities amounted to 124.8 (79.0) MILLION. Net debt amounted to SEK 90.9 (-6.2) million and, excluding lease liabilities relating to right-of-use assets net debt amounted to SEK 39.1 (-41.3) million.

SEK 120.7 (114.8) MILLION. Cash flow from investing activities amounted to SEK -165.3 (-62.8) million, of which acquisitions accounted for -SEK -159.2 (-59.3) million and net investments in fixed assets accounted for SEK -6.1 (-3.5) million.

Cash flow for the period amounted to SEK -34.6 (31.6) million.

Depreciation and amortisation of intangible and tangible fixed assets amounted to SEK 34.8 (25.1) million during the period. Total depreciation of tangible fixed assets amounted to SEK 34.8 (24.5) million, of which SEK 28.6 (20.3) million is directly attributable to right-of-use assets. Depreciation of intangible assets amounted to SEK 0.9 (0.6) million.

Goodwill and other intangible assets
The Group's goodwill at the balance sheet date amounted to SEK 312.4 (188.7) million and the increase compared to the comparative period relates to the acquisition of new subsidiaries. Other intangible assets amounted to SEK 3.2 (2.8) million.

Equity capital
Equity at the balance sheet date amounted to SEK 338.6 (259.1) million, corresponding to SEK 21.00 (16.06) per outstanding share. During the year, an option programme was launched for senior executives and options were subscribed on market terms according to Black & Scholes valuation. The total option programme corresponds to 16 500 shares, which represents 0.1% of the outstanding shares at the balance sheet date.

Parent company
Net sales for the full year amounted to SEK 20.5 (15.8) million and come from internal invoicing of services. Operating profit totalled SEK -2.7 (0.8) million. Profit after financial items amounted to SEK -4.8 (13.7) million. The decrease from the previous year is largely explained by the fact that income from investments in group companies in the comparative period amounted to SEK 15 million compared to SEK 0 million in 2021. Year-end disposals amounted to SEK -13.5 (-6.4) million Group contribution amounted to SEK 65.0 (31.1) million and tax on net income amounted to SEK -9.6 (-5.0) million. Profit after tax amounted to SEK 37.1 (33.3) million.

Future developments
The management team of Teqnion is working systematically to plan for long-term stable growth in each individual company, but also to strengthen the Group as a whole. Demand is good in most businesses. The Group companies have been affected by the coronavirus and its knock-on effects such as increased material prices, component shortages and long delivery times.
The acquisition team within Teqnion has been strengthened in 2021, increasing to three people compared to the previous CEO only. With more resources combined with a strong financial position, the management plans to be able to make around five acquisitions in 2022.

Teqnion's ambition is to create, through the parent company, a stable group of companies, where a long-term and business-oriented mindset offers a good working environment for our staff, security
for our customers, good market penetration for our suppliers and stable value for our owners. We achieve this by using simple, clear and efficient ways of working, offering products from world-leading manufacturers and providing services tailored to the specific needs of our customers.

With a professional organisation and happy employees, Teqnion aims to be a very attractive partner for both its customers and its suppliers.
New financial targets and focus on acquisitions
Teqnion has adopted new financial targets as described on page 9. The reason for the new targets is to focus on fewer but more effective targets and to put a greater focus on creating shareholder value over time. The new financial targets are as follows:

1. STABILITY
To ensure sustainable growth and security, financial stability is needed as a foundation. We will always ensure a healthy balance sheet with a reasonable leverage ratio that never threatens Teqnion.
Financial target 1: Net debt through adjusted EBITDA to be less than 2.5

2. SALARY
Prioritize high-margin projects and acquisitions for high profitability. This ensures strong cash flows that can be used for continued growth.
Financial target 2: Profit margin to be above 9% EBITA

3. SHAREHOLDER VALUE
Once the above financial targets are met, there is full focus on creating shareholder value by increasing earnings per share. This provides the clearest link to value per share over time for the long-term shareholder.
Financial objective 3: Double earnings per share every five years

### Risks and uncertainties
Teqnion's performance and financial position and future development are affected by both external factors where the possibility of the company to influence may be limited and the focus must be on managing what is de facto happening and, on the other hand, the internal factors within the Group's control. Effective risk assessment combines the company's business opportunities and performance with shareholders' demands for long-term value and confidence. For Teqnion's future development, it is important to consider the risk factors in addition to the opportunities for positive development.

The risk factors that are of greatest importance to the Teqnion Group are the economic situation and regulatory and structural changes in the markets in which the subsidiaries operate. Other events affecting the world and the economy, such as the corona pandemic and the war in Ukraine, are also risk factors. Other factors include supplier and customer dependency, the competitive situation and seasonal variations, which are described in the following text. Not all potential risk factors can be included in one report for obvious reasons and an overall assessment should therefore include other information in the annual report and general assessment of the environment.

Economic and market conditions
Demand for Teqnion's products and services is to a large extent influenced by economic conditions and macroeconomic factors in Sweden and abroad. The development of the manufacturing industry and its willingness to invest, the economy in society and the state of the global capital market affect demand and are factors that are beyond Teqnion's control. A weakening of the economic and market situation may have a negative impact on Teqnion's results and financial position.
Teqnion is less sensitive to economic fluctuations due to its well-diversified portfolio of companies and also that the companies have a diversified customer base and product mix where there is a breadth of exposure to different industries, geographies and cyclical dependencies. The decentralised business model means that the subsidiaries can make quick business decisions and thus be adaptable to cyclical and market changes.

The war in Ukraine
Teqnion is closely following developments in the war in Ukraine, the Western sanctions against Russia and the resulting effects on the economy. Teqnion has had marginal sales to Russian-owned companies that have been terminated since the outbreak of the war. Teqnion's companies, like many others, are expected to be indirectly affected by the war, for example through increased raw material prices, component shortages, longer delivery times, as well as economic and market conditions and risk appetite.

Business risks
Financial and regulatory uncertainties are the most concrete uncertainties for Teqnion.
The Group's largest market continues to be Sweden, but sales to customers outside the country are growing.
With an increasing proportion of internationally selling product companies in the Group, the risks of large fluctuations in demand and growth will be countered as larger markets are processed.
As Teqnion sells its products and services almost exclusively to companies and public authorities, it is primarily their purchasing decisions that influence the Group's operations. Teqnion seeks to counter the risks arising from cyclical influences by spreading its operations across several markets, acting
niches and working in a decentralised manner. This diversification means that Teqnion companies' customers are at different stages of the economic cycle. The group is thus less dependent on one or a few end markets for its growth and profitability. This means that a cyclical change in a particular industry or geographic area can affect an individual company's individual company but has less effect on the overall performance of the group. The decentralised nature of the group means that it is the responsibility of the individual subsidiaries to be aware of their market and to take prompt action when needs arise.

Operational risks
Teqnion's subsidiaries operate in a competitive environment. Cost-effective solutions with the right quality are hygiene factors for gaining and maintaining market share. However, the most important means of competition is Teqnion companies' dedicated and experienced staff and their relationships with customers and suppliers. In order to create a clear competitive raison d'être, Teqnion companies work in specific technology areas or with unique business models to dictate certain market conditions in that particular specialist area.
In each niche, Teqnion seeks to take a leading position by offering high value creation for its customers but also good market penetration for its suppliers. Through close and long-term customer relationships and a tailored product offering with the right quality and responsive service, we secure our role as a sought-after partner. With these business conditions, competition from other players is limited and Teqnion's subsidiaries can continue to develop.

Laws and regulations
A number of Teqnion's subsidiaries operate in regulated areas where our employees can support our customers with knowledge and the right products to meet certain requirements. In these contexts, the regulated markets are an advantage for the Teqnion Group as it prevents competition from companies with lower quality and knowledge levels.
Several of the subsidiaries' activities require environmental permits or operate under other notifiable activities. This means close cooperation and reporting obligations with authorities.

Supplier dependency
Dependence on individual suppliers and significant customers are the most important business risks for an individual subsidiary to manage. Some of the companies within the Group have developed their business based on some strong supplier relationships. The loss of one of these will affect the company, particularly in the short term before alternatives are available. To minimise this risk, the subsidiaries work closely with their suppliers to build strong long-term relationships. The subsidiaries also work to identify alternative suppliers before they may be needed.

Customer dependency
Teqnion companies are always actively working to broaden the customer base to reduce dependency on any single customer. The Group as a whole has a very broad customer base, also spread across multiple industry niches and geographic markets, which reduces the impact of a single downturn or loss of customers.

Financial risk management and financial position
Risk management is administered by the CFO in consultation with the Executive Director and the Board of Directors according to guidelines set by the Board. The risk function includes identifying, evaluating and hedging financial risks. This is done in close cooperation with the Group's operational units.
The Group is a Swedish group with operations in several countries. The reporting currency is Swedish kronor. As a result, the Group is exposed to currency risks due to the fact that changes in exchange rates can affect profit and equity. In order to reduce these effects, the Group has borrowings in various currencies to finance movements in countries other than Sweden.
For a more detailed description of the Group's financial risk management, please refer to the section Financial risk management, note 3 of the supplementary disclosures.

The management team in Teqnion works systematically to plan for stable growth in each company in the long term, but also to strengthen the Group as a whole.

Staff
The average number of employees in the Group was 314 (214). The change is mainly due to company acquisitions.

Environmental impact
Teqnion's impact on the environment is limited and mainly occurs in connection with the transport of products, business trips and waste management. In addition, a few of the Group's companies are major consumers of electricity for their production.
Environmental work is carried out locally on the basis of each company's specific conditions. Teqnion's environmental policy forms the basis of its operations. In specific procurements, for example of transport and electricity, there is some coordination between the companies. The Teqnion companies strive for high efficiency in the use of energy and natural resources and work to use good systems for reusing and recycling materials in order to limit any pollution of the environment.
The ambition is to conduct proactive environmental work. There are no known threats that would jeopardise the operation from an environmental point of view.

Sustainable business
Teqnion's ambition is to continuously develop and strengthen the Group's companies in the area of sustainability. Teqnion will ensure a safe working environment and that the people working within the Group are positively affected. Through its subsidiaries, Teqnion shall create efficient business with sustainable value for its employees, its shareholders and for society and the world at large. Teqnion acquires well-managed and profitable companies that share Teqnion's values of sustainable business.
Sustainability issues are a recurring theme in discussions about Teqnion's, as well as its subsidiaries', strategic direction. Teqnion warmly cherishes its principles of long-term ownership, diversity, good working environment, customer value and high business ethics. Teqnion's decisions and actions will ensure that Teqnion will still be around in a hundred years' time.

Activities subject to authorisation or notification under the Environmental Code
Teqnion's subsidiary Cellab carries out activities that require an environmental permit and its subsidiary Stans & Press carries out activities that require notification. Teqnion and its subsidiaries are not involved in any environmental disputes.

Parent company
In Teqnion AB, the management works on the overall strategies that apply to the Group and deals with issues relating to acquisitions and major investments. Such issues are prepared by the Group Management, which then submits them for decision by the Parent Company's Board of Directors.
The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is responsible for the day-to-day management of the company in accordance with the Board's decisions and guidelines. Teqnion AB's Group Management consists of the CEO, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), three Business Area Managers, the Business Developer/
Acquisition General Manager (CXO). In addition, there is an accounting manager and an accounting economist. Teqnion's management monitors the development of its subsidiaries and ensures the safe integration of new companies into the Group. Other tasks include acquisition projects, Group-wide projects, Group financial reporting, internal and external information, and coordination and monitoring of safety, environment and quality.
The Group's operational activities are carried out in subsidiaries of Teqnion. In all subsidiaries, active board work is carried out under the leadership of someone from the Group management. The boards of the subsidiaries monitor the day-to-day operations and determine
the strategies applicable to each company. The subsidiaries operate independently within their respective market niches but according to the rules, guidelines and policies set by the Executive Committee as well as by guidelines set by the respective subsidiary boards. The subsidiary managers are responsible for the performance of their respective companies and for ensuring long-term growth with profitability. 
The operational management is characterised by a demanding approach by the Executive Committee and a high degree of freedom for each subsidiary to make decisions and act in order to achieve the set objectives.

On 31 March 2022, these consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors for publication. The Group's profit and loss account and balance sheet will be subject to adoption at the Annual General Meeting on 5 May 2022.
All amounts are presented in thousands of Swedish kronor, kSEK, unless otherwise stated.

### Note 2 Summary of significant accounting policies
#### 2.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act, RFR 1 Supplementary Accounting Rules for Groups and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and Interpretations of the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC) as adopted by the EU. Assets and liabilities are stated at historical cost. No financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss exist in the Group in any of the periods presented.
The principal accounting policies applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. In addition, it requires management to make certain judgements in the process of adopting the Group's accounting policies. The areas involving a high degree of judgement, which are complex or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 4.
The parent company financial statements have been prepared in accordance with RFR 2 Accounting for Legal Entities and the Annual Accounts Act. Where the Parent applies accounting policies different from those of the Group, this is disclosed separately at the end of this section.

#### New and amended standards to be applied by the Group in the current period

During 2021, no new accounting standards have come into force that have been applied in the consolidated financial statements.
#### Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards effective in 2022 or later that are expected to have or may have an impact on the financial statements

There are no new IFRS standards or IFRIC pronouncements that will have a material impact on the Group's results and position in the financial year 2022. No new IFRS standards or interpretations have been applied early.


#### 2.2 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

##### Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all undertakings over which the Group has a controlling influence. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to or has the right to variable returns from its interest in the entity and has the power to influence those returns through its influence in the entity. Subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control is transferred to the group. They are excluded from the consolidated financial statements from the date on which control ceases.
The acquisition method is used to account for the Group's business combinations. The purchase consideration for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities assumed and the shares issued by the Group. The purchase price also includes the fair value of any assets or liabilities arising from a contingent consideration arrangement.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are initially measured at fair value at the acquisition date. For each acquisition, the Group determines whether all non-controlling interests in the acquiree are carried at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net assets.

The amount by which the purchase price, any non-controlling interest and the fair value at the acquisition date of previous shareholdings exceeds the fair value of the Group's share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. If the amount is less than the fair value of the acquiree's assets, in the event of a "bargain purchase" Negative goodwill, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement as Other operating income.

Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Gains and losses resulting from intercompany transactions that are recognised in assets are also eliminated. The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where appropriate to ensure consistent application of the Group's policies.

##### Transactions with non-controlling interests
The Group applies the principle of accounting for transactions with non-controlling shareholders as transactions with Group shareholders. In the case of acquisitions from non-controlling interests, the difference between the purchase price paid and the actual share acquired of the carrying amount of the net assets of the subsidiary is recognised in equity. Gains and losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recognised in equity.

#### 2.3 REVENUE RECOGNITION
The Group applies IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers from 1 January 2018. The starting point of the standard is that revenue is recognised when control of a product sold is transferred to the customer and the sales price is allocated to the performance obligations identified in the contracts. The performance obligations can be fulfilled at a specific point in time as well as over time.

##### Sale of goods
The majority of the Group's revenue is derived from the sale of goods such as technical components, materials and advanced equipment. Delivery is not considered to have taken place until the products have been shipped to the specified location, the risks of failure and loss have been transferred to the customer and the customer has accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract, the conditions for acceptance have expired or the Group has objective evidence that all acceptance criteria have been met. The sale of the above goods sometimes includes discounts and customary industry guarantees. Discounts are recognised in the period to which they relate. Transaction prices under contracts for the sale of goods are usually invoiced upon fulfilment of delivery terms.

##### Sales of services
The Group sells services in the form of consultancy, development, installation, service and maintenance, often linked to product sales but also as stand-alone services. Revenue from the sale of services is recognised in the period in which the services are rendered and the obligations are fulfilled. Revenue is calculated by determining the stage of completion of the specific transaction based on the proportion of the total services to be performed represented by the services rendered.

##### Interest income
Interest income is recognised as income over the period using the effective interest method.

#### 2.4 SEGMENT REPORTING
The activities of the Group are diverse and are conducted through the subsidiaries that make up the Group. The results and financial position are monitored by subsidiary and operating segment. Income and expenses are attributed to the subsidiary and operating segment in which they are used or earned and consumed. The operating segments consist of Industry, Growth and Niche. Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided
to the chief operating decision maker, which is the CEO together with the Board of Directors.

#### 2.5 FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERSION Functional and reporting currency
Items included in the financial statements of the various entities of the Group are measured in the currency of the primary economic environment in which each entity operates (functional currency). The Group's consolidated financial statements use Swedish kronor (SEK) as the presentation currency, which is also the Parent's functional and presentation currency.

##### Transactions and balance sheet items
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the settlement of
transactions and on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the closing rate, are recognised in the economic outturn account. Exchange differences on loans and borrowings are included in net financial income, while other exchange differences are included in the operating result.
