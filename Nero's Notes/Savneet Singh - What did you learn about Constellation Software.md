# Savneet Singh - What did you learn about [[Constellation Software]]

**Patrick O'Shaughnessy :** I'm sure you've thought a ton. I know you've thought a ton about [[Constellation Software]], which is the paradigmatic perfect software roll-up company that trades publicly. It really hasn't needed to tap capital markets for funding. It's self-funding. It's this incredibly virtuous cycle that happens in the way you're describing you hope to build Tera. Talk about maybe any lessons from watching Mark Leonard and watching Constellation and what the key differences are. My guess is one of them is centralization. I think Constellation basically buys companies and completely leaves them alone. I'm curious what you've learned from Constellation as a capital allocation engine, as an acquiring engine in software specifically.


**Savneet Singh :**  Discipline. Constellation was started 23 years ago by a former venture capitalist who realized that the stack of maintenance revenue on software is really, really, really sticky. He said, "I'm going to go buy these companies with high maintenance software. I'm going to keep the management place but I'm going to tell the management you have to get to 40% cashflow margins and then you get a bonus." He would buy a company and get us a 40% cashflow margins. Take the money that that business went off and buy the next business. It was very much the cigar butt scenario where you're milking the existing asset. Every single year, you're raising price 8%. You lose 6% of customers. You still grow 2% a year and you're able to take this amazing cashflow and then to keep reinvesting. What I think we've learned from studying Constellation and interviewing tons of people from Constellation, is they are the most disciplined buyer I have ever, ever seen. If it's one penny above that ... There's a story of Warren Buffet and ABC. If you're 25 cents above that price, you won't go. These guys are by the penny. They have an amazing structure there.

I think the second thing that's interesting about the way he's done it is it's a process. It is not that we are experts in software. It is not that we have a vision of the future. What he literally looks for is your retention right here? Is your revenue here? Can we buy your company here? Okay. We'll buy you. By making it completely process-based, you can hire hundreds of people to keep finding deals for you. When we look at that, we said, "We learned a lot that the model of buying recurring revenue at cheap prices works really well to compound capital particularly if you can reallocate it." But what we also said is, "That probably works less favorable when you have larger amounts of capital and where there's lots of people that have figured that out, too." That's where this operating lens came in for us. Where we said, "Imagine if you had that power, that many businesses and the power that that has." You said, "Guess what? 200 companies of ours, here's this playbook for sales and marketing that's working for Company Y. You're in the exact same space. Why don't you try this, too?" Trying to figure out what are the best practices we can apply across that and then taking the talent to do that, which is another thing that I think most holding companies haven't gotten gotten to for good reason but we're exploring it.
