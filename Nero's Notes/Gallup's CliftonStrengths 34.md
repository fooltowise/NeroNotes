# Gallup's CliftonStrengths 34

## My Top Strengths


### 1) Context

Context: I learn from the past to figure out what has worked well or what has failed. I work best with case studies.

##### How to invest in Context

Look to the past to build a better tomorrow.

-   Help my school, team or organization strengthen its culture via folklore. For example, collect symbols and stories about the past, or suggest naming an award after someone you can memorialize for their contributions.
-   **Find a mentor** who has lived in my community or worked in my organization for a long time. Listening to this person’s experiences will likely spark my thought process and accelerate my learning.
-   Study my past successes. Try to identify the specific actions or behaviors that contributed to them so you can draw on them again. 
-   Become an agent for positive change. Having strong Context talents does not mean that I live in the past. It means that I can clearly identify which aspects of the past to discard and which to keep to build a better, more sustainable future. 
-   Empower others to make more informed choices. When a problem occurs, ask them to identify the factors that led to it so they can learn from the situation and make better decisions in the future.



### 2) Intellection

I like to think a lot and spend time alone in introspection. I am not satisfied with simply gathering knowledge; the real reward comes with true understanding. In contrast with Learner, while those with Learner like to accrue knowledge broadly, those with Intellection prefer to learn on a deep, intimate level.

##### How to invest in Intellection

Think deeply. Think often.

-   Set aside a few minutes every day to collect my thoughts. This reflection time will energize me, and my thinking will become sharper and more effective. 
-   Get involved in big projects or initiatives in the early stages, before the action begins. I have the ability to follow a trail to see where it leads, and my insights enable projects to move forward intelligently and without backtracking.
-   Take time to write. Writing might be the best way to crystallize and integrate my thoughts. Make a list of my best ideas, and refer to it often. Revisiting my thoughts can give you valuable insights. -> **Journalling** 
-   Give people time to think through the thoughts and ideas I present. Remember that they have not spent as much time as I have pondering, so they might not grasp my message right away.
-   **Deliberately build relationships with people I consider to be “big thinkers.” Their example will inspire me to focus my own thinking.**


### 3) Learner

I have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. The process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites me.

##### How to invest in Learner

-   Become an early adopter of new technology, and keep your coworkers, friends and family informed. You learn quickly, and others will appreciate when you share and explain cutting-edge developments to them. 
-   Respect your desire to learn. Take advantage of educational opportunities in your community or at work. Discipline yourself to sign up for at least one new course or class each year.
-   Find opportunities to expand your knowledge. Take on increasingly difficult topics, courses or projects. You love the challenge of a steep learning curve, so beware of learning plateaus.
-   Be a catalyst for change. New rules, skills or circumstances might intimidate others. Your willingness to absorb new and different factors can calm their fears.
-   **Keep track of your learning progress.** If a skill or topic has distinct levels or stages of learning, celebrate your progression from one level to the next. If not, create them for yourself. For example, set a goal of reading five books on a new subject.
- Revisit an unfinished project. Why did you abandon it? What do you know now about it that you didn't before? How did (even the unfinished) this project inform your understanding today?

### 4) Analytical
I search for reasons and causes. I have the ability to think about all of the factors that might affect a situation.

##### How to invest in Analytical

Use your logical, objective approach to make important decisions.
-   Identify credible sources you can rely on. Find helpful books, websites, experts or other resources that you can use as references.
-   Get involved in the planning stages of a new initiative or project so you can evaluate its feasibility and direction before it gets too far along.
-   Accept that sometimes you will need to take action before all the facts are in place.
-   Choose assignments or work that allows you to analyze data, find patterns or organize ideas.
-   Develop your Analytical talents by sharing your ideas with other analytical minds who specialize in your area.


### 5) Input
I have a need to collect and archive. I may accumulate information, ideas, artifacts or even relationships.

##### How to invest in Input
Keep exploring; always be curious.
-   Find out more about areas you want to specialize in. Consider jobs or volunteer opportunities where you can acquire and share information every day, such as teaching, journalism or research work. 
-   Regularly read books and articles that motivate you. Increase your vocabulary by collecting new words and learning their meaning.
-   Devise a system to store and easily locate information you have found so you can access it quickly. Use whatever approach works best for you — a file for articles you have saved, a database or spreadsheet, or a list of your favorite websites.
-   Position yourself as an expert. Share your exceptional archive of facts, data and ideas with others when they need help or advice.
-   Seek out subject-matter experts who would be interested in knowing what you are learning and who would find it stimulating to hear about the questions and ideas you generate through your exploration.


### 6) Maximiser

I focus on strengths as a way to stimulate personal and group excellence. I seek to transform something strong into something superb. I focus on quality rather than quantity.

##### How should I take action

Strive for excellence, and encourage others to do the same.

-   Stay focused on your own strengths. Choose one talent you want to maximize each month, and invest in building on it. Refine your skills. Acquire new knowledge. Practice. **Keep working toward mastery.**
-   Make your weaknesses irrelevant. **Find a partner, devise a support system or use one of your stronger themes to compensate for your weaker ones.**
-   Help your friends and coworkers recognize others’ talents and strengths.

### 7) Deliberative

You are best described by the serious care you take in making decisions or choices. I anticipate obstacles and try to avoid risk. Paired with *Context*, I use checklists.

##### How should I take action

Stop, listen and assess before taking action.

-   Rely on your good judgment, caution and conservative decision-making during times of change. Your ability to identify and reduce risk is a powerful advantage.
-   Be sure to set aside time for yourself. Try this: Reserve 20 minutes each day to sort through your projects, plans and ideas. Use this time to gather information on options, assess different situations or solidify choices you need to make. When you have the opportunity and freedom to calculate, you will make better decisions.
-   Help others think through what they want to do. Whatever your role is, you can become a valuable sounding board because you identify and assess potential risks that others might not see.


###  8) Responsibility

I take psychological ownership of what I say I will do. I are committed to stable values such as honesty and loyalty.

##### How should I take action

Take ownership for the things that matter most to you.
-   Always check your schedule and to-do list before taking on a new request. This will help you realistically meet all of your commitments without overworking yourself and demonstrate to others that you are serious about your responsibilities. 
-   Align yourself with those who share your sense of commitment. You will thrive when you are surrounded by others who take their responsibilities as seriously as you do.
-   Be an ethical watchdog for your school, organization or community by taking action to eliminate and prevent any unethical behavior you see.


### 9) Command

I have presence. I can take control of a situation and make decisions.

##### How should I take action
-   Practice the words, tone and techniques that turn your ability to confront into persuasiveness.
-   Take on worthwhile challenges, and bring others with you. Use your Command talents to lead others out of their comfort zone and into new territory where change is inevitable.
-   Help your colleagues and friends make commitments. You can provide the spark that will inspire them to act.

### 10) Strategic

I quickly weigh alternative paths and determine the best one.

#### How should I take action

-   Strengthen the groups you belong to by using your talent to discover the best path to success. Because you can do this quickly, it may look as if you are “winging it,” so explain yourself along the way to help others understand what you see.
-   Schedule time each day to think about your goals and strategies. Time alone might be the best way for you to evaluate all your options and to find the right course of action for each goal.
-   Trust your insights. Because you consider options so naturally and easily, you might not realize how you came up with a strategy. But because of your exceptional talents, it will likely be successful.
