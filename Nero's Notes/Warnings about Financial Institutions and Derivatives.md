# Warnings about Financial Institutions and Derivatives

### Risk of financial institutions
The nature of a financial institution is that there are a lot of ways to go to hell in a bucket. You can push credit too far, do a dumb acquisition, leverage yourself excessively - it's not just derivatives that can bring your downfall.

Maybe it's unique to us, but we're quite sensitive to financial risks. Financial institutions make us nervous when they're trying to do well.

We're exceptionally goosey of leveraged financial institutions. If they start talking about how good risk management is, it makes us nervous.

We fret way earlier than other people. We've left a lot of money on the table through early fretting. It's the way we are - you'll just have to live with it.

### Derivatives
The system is almost insanely irresponsible. And what people think are fixed aren't really fixes. It's so complicated I can't do it justice here - but you can't believe the trillions of dollars involved. You can't believe the complexity. You can't believe how difficult is is to do the accounting. You can't believe how big the incentives are to have wishful thinking about values and wishful thinking about ability to clear.

People don't think about the consequences of the consequences. People start by trying to hedge against interest rate changes, which is very difficult and complicated. Then, the hedges make the reported profits lumpy. So then they use new derivatives to smooth this. Well, now you've morphed into lying. This turns into a Mad Hatter's Tea Party. This happens to vast, sophisticated corporations.

Somebody has to step in and say "We're not going to do it - it's just too hard."

I think a good litmus test of the mental and moral quality at any large institution with significant derivatives exposure would be to ask them, "Do you really understand your derivatives book?" Anyone who says yes is either crazy or lying.

It's easy to see the dangers when you talk about what happened with the energy derivatives - they went kerflooey. When the companies reached for the assets that were on the books, the money wasn't there. When it comes to financial assets, we haven't had any such denouement, and the accounting hasn't changed, so the denouement is ahead of us.

Derivatives are full of clauses that say if one party's credit gets downgraded, then it has to put up collateral. It's like margin - you can go broke just putting up more margin. In attempting to protect themselves, they've introduced instability. Nobody seems to recognize what a disaster of a system they have created. It's a demented system. 

In engineering people have a big margin of safety. But in the financial world, people don't give a damn about safety. They let it balloon and balloon and balloon. It's aided by false accounting. I'm more pessimistic about this than Warren.

### Accounting for Derivatives
I hate with a passion GAAP as applied to derivatives and swaps. JP Morgan sold out to this type of accounting to front-end revenues. I think it's a disgrace.

It's bonkers, and the accountants sold out. Everyone caved, adopted loose accounting standards, and created exotic derivatives linked to theoretical models. As a result, all kinds of earnings, blessed by accountants, are not really being earned. When you reach for the money, it melts away. It was never there.

It is just disgusting. It is a sewer, and if I'm right, there will be hell to pay in due course. All of you will have to prepare to deal with a blowup of derivative books.

To say accounting for derivatives in America is a sewer is an insult to sewage.

### Likelihood of a derivatives blowup
We tried to sell Gen Re's derivatives operation and couldn't, so we started liquidating it. We had to take big markdowns. I would confidently predict that most of the derivatives books of this country's major banks cannot be liquidated for anything like what they're carried on the books at. When the denouement will happen and how severe it will be, I don't know. But I fear the consequences could be fearsome. I think there are major problems, worse than in the energy field, and look at the destruction there.

I'll be amazed if we don't have some kind of significant derivatives-related blowup in the next five to ten years.

I think we're the only big corporation in America to be running off its derivative book.

It's a crazy idea for people who are already rich - like Berkshire - to be in this business. It's a crazy business for big banks to be in.
