# Why does branding work

Why does branding work? [[Charlie Munger]]’s framework of models from social psychology and a few models from microeconomics provide the answer.

The models from psychology are:
1.  Liking: We love the brand ambassadors and want to buy what they want us to buy.
2.  Pavlovian association: Almost all advertising is a form of creating positive associations between a product or service and happiness and successful brands get consumers to associate price with quality.
3.  Social Proof: We want to be popular by buying and using stuff that everyone else is using and people buy brands because other people buy brands.
4.  Scarcity: Branded products are more exclusive than unbranded ones and that adds value to them.
5.  Authority: Brand ambassadors are symbols of authority even though they were just acting. Cialdini’s book cites the example of a very popular doctor actor who subsequently endorses branded medicines on TV commercials. And people buy those med because the “doc told them to” even when they know the doc was just an actor.


Here are a few models from economics:

1.  Price inelasticity: the really successful brands make consumers relatively indifferent to price increases.

2.  Aspirations: Almost every human being wants to get better, wants to move ahead in life and generally speaking, even the poor people, who buy unbranded products, aspire to buy branded ones one day. For millions of such people in India that day has arrived. This demographic change is a key theme for identifying businesses which benefit from this change, and Relaxo happens to be one of them.
