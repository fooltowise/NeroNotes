# Life is Competition
The first biological lesson from history is that life is competition. Men are at peace when food is plenty, and violent when food is lacking.

Even if cooperation is real and increases with social development, it is only a tool and a form of competition. We cooperate in our group - family, community, club, church, party, nation - in order to reinforce our group in its competition with other groups

We are constantly competing because our genes remember the thousands of years when we had to hunt and fight to eat and survive, and when we had to eat up to our gastric capacity, by fear that we would not find such a feast before long.
