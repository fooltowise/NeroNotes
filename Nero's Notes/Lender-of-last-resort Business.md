Lenders-of-last-resort companies (exemple: Anglo-Irish bank) are usually a very risky business:
- Their interest rate is higher than competition, especially regular banks whose bread and butter is to make loans
- As a result, the only reason why borrowers are coming to lenders of last resort is that they have been rejected by everybody else. Therefore, their risk of default is alarmly high.
- As a result, the book of these business is full of risky loans. This is a train wreck waiting to happen.
