# Rule Beating

## Description:

Rules governing a system can sometimes lead to rule beating. A perverse behavior emerges that gives appearance to obey the rules and to reach the goals, but that actually distorts the system.

## Solution:

Design rules to release creativity, not toward rule beating, but toward the direction of reaching the real goals defined by the rules.
