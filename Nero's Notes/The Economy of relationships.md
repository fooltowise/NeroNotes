# The Economy of relationships
Relationship dynamics apply in business and personal life. How are you expending resources? How can you cultivate a win-win dynamic in your daily interactions?

[We’ve previously discussed the four permutations of relationships 77](https://fs.blog/2015/10/four-types-of-relationships/)—which hold true whether the parties are people, organizations, romantic partners, customers and vendors. There are four possible dynamics between any two parties: lose-lose, lose-win, win-lose, and win-win. Let’s explore these a bit further:

1.  **Lose-lose**: Both parties lose something of value without gaining anything. Most people don’t choose this dynamic except when dominated by intense emotions. Think of the couple going through a divorce, with each party devoting time, energy, and attention to controlling or punishing the other. Or think of two people arguing in a meeting when it becomes personal and anger takes over. In these situations, are the parties likely to find productive solutions?
    
2.  **Lose-win**: One party suffers while the other gains. Sounds weird, but we often choose to do this for close friends or family, in a form of self-sacrifice that we hope may be rewarded on some level over the course of the relationship. In other instances, a party may also choose a small loss to prevent a larger one. It’s also common in business with people who often feel victimized or helpless.
    
3.  **Win-lose**: This may be seen as simply a more coercive form of the previous dynamic. One party wins while the other loses—the winner may take advantage of the other party or make unfair demands. This type of dynamic is usually unsustainable in both business and personal relationships. Even the winner may lose over time, because most of the gains in a relationship occur over the long term.
    
4.  **Win-win**: Both parties gain. This is a recipe for growth. In business or in personal relationships, the parties meet goals and gain resources. Best of all, they can continue to benefit from the relationship over time, through repeat exchanges or growth. They want to do business together. They trust each other and will be more willing to look out for each other.
    

It’s clear why we want to avoid the losing side. Most of us also intuitively avoid taking advantage of other people and get uncomfortable if others go out of their way so we can gain. But not all relationships that have these dynamics are formalized and codified. These dynamics can happen every day without our noticing. Knowing the framework, the four basic dynamics, helps us see them in action where we might have missed them before. With this knowledge, we may be able to cultivate better relationships that benefit all participants.

Consider how most of us spend valuable assets like time, energy, money, and even happiness. In daily life, a lot of it goes toward people who have little to gain from engaging us, or who offer us little in return. Here are some examples:

• Office colleagues try to embarrass you in a meeting. This stressful encounter consumes you for days and weeks after.  
• Acquaintances come in and out of your lives whenever you’re happy and leave after they’ve watered the seeds of unhappiness.  
• People want your advice over and over, never follow it, and offer no value in return.

When we’re on the losing side of a formal agreement, it’s pretty easy to see and feel exactly what’s happening. The investments are bigger: more time, more energy, more of our resources are involved. In the day-to-day, investments of time and energy can be like petty cash spending, slipping away almost unnoticed. Yet it’s these daily things that rob us of our energy and time, like small spending eating away at a budget. And as days become weeks and weeks become months, the aggregation of those micro-payments overtakes the large transactions.

**For discussion:**

What are some ways you wind up on the losing side of day-to-day interactions? How can you improve those relationships and share the gains? Can you cultivate a win-win dynamic in more areas of your life and work?
