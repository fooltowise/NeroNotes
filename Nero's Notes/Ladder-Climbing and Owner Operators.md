# Ladder-Climbing and [[Owner Operators]]

### by [[Demesne Investments]]

Two of the most reliable indicators of bureaucracy go hand-in-hand – the so-called “transformational acquisition” and, sooner or later, the subsequent announcement of a sweeping restructuring program. It should therefore come as no surprise that Medtronic, the world’s largest medical device conglomerate, recently announced a significant restructuring initiative just five years removed from its $50 billion mega-merger with Covidien. Normally I would not give a second thought to this kind of announcement. However, this one had an intriguing element that caught my attention: decentralization. 

In his comments to investors at an October Investor Day event, new CEO Geoff Martha articulated his vision to reconfigure Medtronic “from one $30 billion company to twenty $1.5 billion agile companies”. According to the plan, these business units will be unnested from their current reporting structure, empowering their leaders with full P&L responsibility, control over their go-to-market strategy, and freedom to manage their own R&D program. In doing so, large layers of centralized management infrastructure will be removed, yielding savings in the range of $450 to $475 million.

Practically speaking, Medtronic is still an unlikely candidate for Demesne’s portfolio. Its gargantuan size makes it difficult to earn the supranormal returns to which Demesne aspires. Even if the restructuring plan goes smoothly and according to plan, management is anticipating that the more “agile” structure will add a mere one percentage point to topline growth and generate modest earnings growth of 8%.
Furthermore, there is good reason to be skeptical that the restructuring will in fact go smoothly and according to plan. Although Demesne occasionally invests in companies undergoing an uncertain transition from a centralized to decentralized structure, I do so cautiously. Bureaucracies breed a myriad of vested territorial interests united only in their preference for the status quo. An organization attempting to dismantle its bureaucracy must fight an uphill battle against itself.

I will keep an eye on Medtronic going forward, but in this letter, I want to look back. I specifically want show how bureaucracies like Medtronic are structurally inimical to fostering an authentic ethos of ownership. I will also discuss how decentralized businesses take the idea of an Owner Operator to whole new level, briefly discussing the company [[Lifco]] as an example.

## Climbing the Corporate Ladder
Much could be said about the various bureaucratic pathologies that have come to weigh on Medtronic. Mr. Martha has discussed many of them at recent investor events including its matrix organizational structure, rapid market share losses to new competitors, duplicative functional groups, and crippling red tape. Given Medtronic’s position as the largest medical device company on Earth, it is hard not to see these problems as a direct repudiation of the gospel of scale-above-all that dominates corporate and Wall Street thinking.

However, I want to focus on Mr. Martha himself because his own career path reflects something important about bureaucracies, namely, how they are not structured to foster a culture of authentic ownership. Below is a succinct summary of his career, courtesy of his LinkedIn profile. As you can see, Mr. Martha has spent his entire professional life navigating two enormous conglomerates, General Electric and Medtronic. He joined General Electric directly out of college and progressively climbed the ladder. In 2011, he followed his boss from GE Healthcare to Medtronic where he eventually succeeded him in April of 2020.

One thing that immediately stands out from Mr. Martha’s resume is that he rarely stayed in one role for more than a few years. Further still, he rarely even stayed in the same business group. As he put it himself in a 2014 interview, “I would go back and forth primarily between mergers and acquisitions and running businesses." Mr. Martha’s itinerancy is the natural consequence of incentives. When clout and compensation are concentrated in the upper crusts of a hierarchy, as is typically the case, the best way for an executive to better his lot is to clamber upwards. Constant internal rent-seeking generates new layers, departments, and titles to keep this compensation competition fresh for a long time, even for those not destined for the C-suite. Finally made it to Group Vice President? How does Executive Vice President sound? As a consequence, the parts of the business that are closest to the front lines come to be viewed as stepping-stones in the pursuit of personal enrichment. Likewise, functions that were once proper to specific business lines trace parallel trajectories as they are also increasingly centralized away from the front lines.


This is a point that leaders of decentralized businesses often stress when critiquing their more bureaucratic peers. Conventional hierarchical structures tacitly stigmatize the dirty work of real entrepreneurship while fetishizing the detached corporate ivory tower and the perks that come with it. It promotes a short-term mentality because executives are incentivized to show quick wins in order to secure the next promotion, while undermining accountability since they won’t be around for the long-term consequences. The further removed from the front lines the executive gets, even the attribution of consequences becomes problematic. In short, it is an incentive structure that molds its best and brightest into the antithesis of an owner.

In a scene that would be at home in the frames of a Dilbert cartoon, Mr. Martha recently illustrated these dynamics to ironic perfection when he described how Medtronic’s mega-merger with Covidien was a prime culprit for the company’s bureaucratic morass for which he is now proposing a fix... but failing to mention that he himself was not only one of the chief architects of the deal as Senior Vice President of Strategy and Development at the time, but had even been formally named its Chief Integration Officer!

>“It wasn't that long ago, in 2015, we closed on the Covidien deal. We took two 45,000-person organizations and put them together. And yes, we took out a lot of what I would say, the synergies we got, the several billion in synergies, a lot of it came from real duplicative costs... But there's still -- as we put the 2 companies together, we went to a fairly rigid matrix, if you will, and a little top-heavy and over time, bureaucracy is built up.” - Geoff Martha, CEO of Medtronic (2020 Investor and Analyst Day)

 
I do not think that Mr. Martha is deliberately trying to deflect from his own culpability in these statements. I believe he genuinely sees the synergy capture and bureaucratic creep from the Covidien acquisition as two separate and unrelated matters. Regular readers of Demesne’s letters know better than that. If he had spent more time closer to the front lines instead of a series of insulated corporate positions, he would innately understand that “synergies” come by way of centralization, which emasculate the front lines for the sake of the growing bureaucracy he now bemoans. Furthermore, it does not seem to occur to him that the Covidien deal may have been ill-advised from the start given the objectively dismal record of mega-mergers. In other words, he has made an unwitting admission of a wholesale failure to think long-term. Though I give Mr. Martha a lot of credit for his call to decentralize, his naiveté to these connections, let alone his own hand in them, is demonstrative of the blinding effects of bureaucratic incentives.

Decentralized businesses, on the other hand, invert this disordered incentive structure in the hopes of incentivizing the opposite – long-term thinking, accountability, and ownership. By design, decentralized businesses have much leaner corporate offices and a paucity of centralized global functions which limit the opportunities for ladder-climbing. More importantly, the substantive operational decision-making is pushed down into its independent business units. For most entrepreneurial-minded executives, running a niche high-performance business unit with generous autonomy is an extremely compelling proposition compared to the relatively toothless corporate center. As a result, leaders in decentralized businesses are much less likely to be found hopscotching around the organization.

Longevity is the natural bedfellow of long-term thinking. Combined with the freedom to exercise their own agency, it allows leaders to cultivate deep domain expertise and, eventually, mastery in their niche. They develop personal relationships with customers and come to intimately understanding their needs. They learn how to construct a high-performance team and forge comradery through their shared highs and lows. They build up an industry network to help them identify good suppliers, new customers, and rising talent to recruit onboard. The logo on the door becomes a proud part of their identity, their reputation. In other words, they become attached at a professional, personal, and communal level to their business. Compensation is certainly still important, but these kinds of attachments are what comprise an authentic ethos of ownership, not stock options and bonuses.


## [[Owner Operators]]


No discussion of ownership is complete without addressing [[Owner Operators]]. An Owner Operator is a CEO (or hands-on Chairman) who is not only a skilled entrepreneur, but also owns a significant stake in the company. Usually, this person is the founder. In the minds of many investors, this is the Platonic ideal of alignment. What better incentive is there to act like an owner than to literally be one of the largest owners? Most investors tend to focus on the significance of the Owner Operator’s financial stake as their key motivating factor, but I would argue that the “softer” variables I discussed at the end of the previous section – affection and pride for the organization they built over a number of years – are just as important. Whatever the case, there is good evidence in support of the Owner Operator hypothesis.

Having an Owner Operator leading a company is all well and good, but what if you could have not just one but a multitude of them? We have already discussed how a decentralized structure creates an environment that nurtures the development of authentic ownership across many independent business units. In addition to that, decentralized holding companies tend to heavily skew their acquisitions towards family and founder-led businesses. In doing so, decentralized businesses systematically import [[Owner Operators]]. As a result, the roots of ownership in a decentralized conglomerate often run far deeper than they first appear. 

The bedrock principle of empowering entrepreneurs with independence and selective support naturally resonates with founders. It also addresses a common fear: that their life’s work, and a community of people they care about (be they customers or colleagues), will be cast asunder by the wrong owner. A former M&A Director at [[Constellation Software]] (discussed in my previous letter) gives strong testimony to this dynamic:

>“I was shocked to see how important it was that Constellation was  essentially protecting customers by keeping the products alive. That was an important point for many of these owners, and in some cases, we would write into the deals that we wouldn't terminate certain employees, because they'd become friends, and essentially considered family, and so those were deal points that were quite powerful.” - Former M&A Director for [[Constellation Software]]

Decentralized businesses go to great lengths to cater a message to founders that they will provide an ideal long-term home for their businesses. Therefore, this is something I look for when seeking them out. One company whose message is more on-the-nose than most is [[Lifco]]. For starters, take a look at its tagline found all over its website and presentation materials:

[[LIFCO]] - A SAFE HAVEN FOR YOUR BUSINESS

[[Lifco]] has a circuitous history. Its roots can be traced to a failing Electrolux subsidiary called Getinge that was acquired in 1989 by two investor-operators, Carl Bennett and Rune Andersson. Mr. Bennett ran Getinge as its CEO while Mr. Andersson was the Chairman. In 1998, [[Lifco]] was spun out from Getinge with Mr. Bennett as the controlling shareholder. He took it private two years later, sold off ~40% of the revenues not related to its core business in dental product distribution, and merged it with another company he owned that specialized in attachments for demolition and excavation equipment. It finally came back to public markets in 2014 via IPO. During its time as a private company under the leadership of its longtime CEO Fredrik Karlsson, [[Lifco]] coalesced around a decentralized strategy focused on the acquisition of niche businesses, initially around its core dental distribution and demolition tools specialties, but increasingly into other adjacent areas. Today, [[Lifco]] is comprised of over 160 businesses and counting.

In contrast to its convoluted past, [[Lifco]] summarizes its principles in elegant simplicity. The below slide, featured regularly in its investor presentations, is a good starting list of tendencies of decentralized businesses. Given the topic of this letter, I want to put special emphasis on [[Lifco]]’s long-term orientation as a perpetual owner and how that is reflected in the low turnover of its employee base (the first and last points on the slide below).

Some selling founders will want to stay on, while others are looking to retire. For those staying with the business, the motivation is to leverage the larger group’s resources and connections to take their business to the next level. Common vectors for growth include internationalization, help with recruiting, capital for growth capex, and support for their own M&A program. On the other hand, it may be even more common for founders to be selling as a succession solution. It is important that decentralized acquirers be sensitive to the personal and family dynamics at play in these cases, because it will be an advantage over most other “heartless” strategic acquirers. In these cases, there may or may not be a new generation of management already lined up. Different decentralized businesses have varying approaches to appointing new management, but that is a topic for another day. However, even without the original founder, the Owner-Operator mindset is usually not lost. The kinds of businesses whose selling founders value continued independence even after they have left tend to be the kinds of businesses that have established cultures of entrepreneurship that thrive best on independence.

Whether the founder is staying or retiring, the key factor is that he wants the decentralized company to be the perpetual owner because it is his best option to preserve its independence and his own legacy. These considerations matter so much that selling founders will routinely leave money on the table to satisfy them. If a decentralized acquirer is known to be true to its word, it does not need to be the highest bidder (if other bidders even get involved at all). In an interview a few years ago, [[Lifco]]’s longtime CEO Fredrik Karlsson made exactly this same point:
>“It is important that their companies live on even when they sell the companies. They also often want to be able to stay in the town without  getting angry glances after themselves for having sold their companies to multinational giants who at best keep the baton for 5-10 years and then close down the factories. To ensure that these conditions are met, sellers are therefore often willing to lower the price of their business when one day they decide to get rid of their life's work.” - Fredrik Karlsson, former CEO of [[Lifco]]

 As any investor knows, paying cheaper valuations is perhaps the most reliable way to achieve superior investment returns (with lower risk to boot). What is less obvious, but which Mr. Karlsson’s commentary makes clearer, is how decentralization enables a company to do so sustainably by accommodating the non-monetary human concerns of selling owners.

## Lessons for Demesne
To summarize, here are the major takeaways for Demesne’s research process
covered in this letter: 
• **Leadership Longevity**. What does the tenure of the business unit leaders look like? Is there evidence of a culture of ladder-climbing?
• **Small Corporate Headquarters.** Does the company have a large number of employees at the corporate center? If so, are they in top-down centralized functions, or shared service centers?
• **Acquiring Founder Businesses**. Does the business have a proclivity for acquiring founder-led businesses? Do incumbent management teams tend to stay on after acquisition? If not, why not (e.g. retirement)?
• **Public Identity as an Owner**. Does the business have a public image explicitly catering to entrepreneurs and founders? Something as simple as a page on their website dedicated to educating prospective sellers of this profile speaks volumes.
• **Acquisition Multiples.** Is the company able to acquire businesses at attractive valuations? Are they usually the highest bidder?

## Closing Thoughts

>I think we at [[Lifco]] have not done anything remarkable. What we have done, we have bought some companies and not destroyed them, and sometimes had a little luck and got a good earnings trend in these companies. That's what we've done. - Fredrik Karlsson, former CEO of [[Lifco]]

In this letter, I have once again drawn a stark contrast between bureaucratic hierarchies and decentralized businesses, showing how the first breeds entitlement while the other nurtures authentic ownership. However, I also want to again reiterate to readers that decentralization and bureaucracy are not binary conditions but exist on a spectrum. All businesses lay somewhere between the two poles and none are perfect. The greed, politics, and pettiness we more readily associate with bureaucratic hierarchies will be found in decentralized businesses too because they are still comprised of sinful human beings. The hope is that when they flare up to problematic proportions, it is at the commensurately smaller scale of the isolated business unit, instead of a centralized bureaucracy from which rot can spread across an entire organization. In the same spirit as Mr. Karlsson’s comments above, Demesne’s thesis is not predicated on decentralization's heroics, but its modesty. Decentralization is valuable for what it promotes, but perhaps more for what it prevents.
