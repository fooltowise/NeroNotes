Because people [[Evolution and self-delusion| don't know consciously the reasons of their behavior]], market research (asking people what they want and why) can be misleading.

David Ogilvy, who started his career in market research, said:
>"The trouble with market research is that people don't think what they feel, they don't say what they think, and they don't do what they say."

**For a business to be truely customer-focused, it needs to ignore what people say. Instead it needs to concentrate on what people feel.**
