# Sex is Genetic Mixing
A normal human being has two copies of each of 75'000 genes in every cell in his or her body. The total complement of 150'000 human genes is called the genome and the genes live on 23 pairs of ribbon-like objects called chromosomes.

When a man impregnates a woman, each one of his sperm contains one copy of each gene, 75'000 in all, on 23 chromosomes. These are added to the 75'000 single genes on 23 chromosomes in the woman's egg to make a complete human embryo with 75'000 pairs of genes and 23 pairs of chromosomes.

One more technical term is essential: *meiosis*, which is simply the procedure by which the male selects the genes that will go into a sperm, or the female selects the genes that will go into an egg. (See [[Selfish Gene]]). The man may choose either the 75'000 genes he inherited from his father, or the 75'000 genes he inherited from his mother, or, more likely, a mixture. 

During meiosis something peculiar happens. Each of the 23 pairs of chromosomes is laid alongside its opposite number. Chunks of one set are swapped with chunks of the other in a procedure called *recombination*. One whole set is then passed on to the offspring to be married with a set from the other parent: a procedure known as *outcrossing*.

Sex is recombination plus outcrossing: this mixing of genes is its principal feature. The consequence is that the baby gets a thorough mixture of his four granparents' genes (because of recombination) via his two parents (because of outcrossing).

Between them, recombination and outcrossing are the essential procedures of sex. Everything else about it - gender, mate choice, incest avoidance, polygamy, love, jealousy - are all ways of doing outcrossing and recombination more effectively or carefully.

**Put this way, sex immediately becomes detached from reproduction. A creature could borrow another's genes at any stage in its life. Indeed, this is exactly what bacteria do. They simply hook up with each other like refueling bombers, pass a few genes through the pipe, and go their separate ways. reproduction they do later, by splitting in half.**

**So sex equals genetic mixing.**
