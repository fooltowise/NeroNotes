# Competition in Politics
If you are a male chimp in a community with other males, it's not enough simply to be strong or even the strongest. You also need to *gang up* with a team of other strong males. You need the ability to identify, attract, and retain good allies, and you need to be savvy enough to navigate the tumult as coalitions form, dissolve, and clash all around you.

Coalitions are what makes politics so *political*.

In government, coalitions appear as interest groups and political parties; in business, they are teams, companies, guilds, and trade associations. In high school, cliques or friends. On the street and in prisons, they are called gangs. 

Coalition can be nasty. Winning tactics often include threats, counter-threats, betrayals, deceptions, and even violence. But it's also full of handshaking, backscratching, and even hugging.
