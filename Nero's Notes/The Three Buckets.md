# The Three Buckets

### Analogy

The Three Buckets is like a slot machine.

The first bucket (“slot”) is composed of inorganic systems – physics, chemistry, science, geology, etc. It is the oldest at 13.7 billion years and has the largest relevant data set.

The second bucket is 3.5 billion years old and is composed of the biological universe – evolution, natural selection, etc.


The third bucket, while having the smallest sample size, is also the most relevant to us. It is composed of 20,000 years of recorded human history.


Because of the large sample size and relevance of these three buckets, when they all yield the same answer, it is the functional equivalent of getting cherries straight across on a slot machine – you’ve got a winner!

### Example

Reciprocation is an excellent example of The Three Bucket framework in action.

In the first bucket, reciprocation captured by Newton’s Third Law of Motion – for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. If you push down on a table with force ‘x,’ the table, perhaps counter-intuitively, pushes back on you with equal force ‘x.’ If you double the force, the table will also push back twice as hard.

Reciprocation is also found in nature, our second bucket. When you pet a kitten nicely and give it a calm environment, it will react in kind by being nice to you. But, grab it by its tail, and don’t be surprised when it scratches your face off.

In bucket number three, the human system, you find the same. If you treat people well, trust them, and add more value than you take, they will reciprocate in kind. However, treat them poorly, spread rumors, micromanage them, and you’ll get the functional equivalent of your face scratched off. This is mirrored reciprocation.


This is a simple but powerful example. In the case of reciprocation, The Three Buckets align perfectly, which gives us confidence that this is how the world works and that we can bank on the reciprocation mental model.

### Plain English

The Three Buckets model was derived by a hugely influential mentor of mine, Peter Kaufman, and he explains it beautifully:

>“So, this is how I use ideas that no one else in the world uses, and yet I can be comfortable that they’re right. A statistician’s best friend is what? A large and relevant sample size. And why? Because a principle derived from a large, relevant sample size can’t be wrong can it? The only way it could be wrong is if the sample size is too small or the sample itself is not relevant. So, I want to tell you what my three buckets are where I derive my multidisciplinary models.
#1 is 13.7 Billion years in science. Is that a large sample? It’s the largest one in the whole universe. There is no larger sample. Because what is it? It’s the inorganic universe. Physics. Geology. Is it relevant? It’s where we live!
Bucket #2 is 3.5 billion years of biology on Earth. It too is big. And relevant – we are biological creatures ourselves!
And bucket #3 is human history. Pick your own number. I picked 20,000 years of recorded human history. It’s big, and the most relevant of all in terms of understanding ourselves.
Those are the three largest sample sizes we can access and the most relevant. This approach provides a framework of general laws that have stood the test of time-invariant, unchanging lenses that we can use to focus and arrive at workable answers. As time discovers truth, when the three buckets align, the joint probability of error drops towards zero. A multidisciplinary framework helps shift the human paradigm to one of an empathetic perspective, as if we were looking from the outside in.




## Technical Description

The Three Buckets is a framework that uses enormous expanses of time and large and relevant sample sizes to find ideas that have proven reliable over time, space, and disciplines. If you discover ideas that align with these three buckets, you should gain confidence that you can count on them to remain true in the future. By its very construction, the Three Buckets approach avoids prime reasons for bad decision-making in the first place:

- Drawing assumptions from too small a sample size
- Drawing assumptions from too narrow an area of specialization
- Wanting the world to work the way we’d like it to behave rather than how it actually does
- Caving to social pressure to conform to group behavior
- Seeing patterns where no patterns really exist
- Being blind to patterns present in massive time scales that dwarf our tiny life spans


### Quotes

> Nothing can be more incorrect than the assumption that one sometimes meets with, that physics has one method, chemistry another, and biology a third.– Thomas Huxley

> The three filters operate through these particular questions: Literacy: What are the words? Numeracy: What are the numbers? Ecolacy: And then what? – Garrett Hardin, Filters Against Folly

> We began construction of a conceptual system in Chapter 2 by assuming the meanings of a few logical, temporal, and spatial concepts, and we used them to define concepts of mechanics and physics. Thus, starting with concepts taken from the formal sciences, we developed a few central concepts of the physical sciences and, using them, then proceeded to the behavioral sciences. The order of this development reflects the commonly held belief that the concepts of science, and hence the sciences themselves, are hierarchical in nature. The concepts of the formal and physical sciences are believed to be fundamental in some sense, and the concepts of the behavioral sciences are believed to be derived from them…We believe that all the concepts of science are interdependent, and therefore illumination of the meaning of any member of the system of scientific concepts can illuminate to varying degrees, each of the other concepts in the system. As we have noted earlier, historical ordering is often confused with logical or epistemological ordering. We do not take the concepts we begin with to be basic in any way, but rather we maintain that they are definable in terms of the concepts derived from them. To show that this is the case is not to close a vicious cycle, but to complete a cycle in which the initial concepts are enriched. It opens the way for another such cycle in which the meanings of all the concepts can be further enhanced. – Russell Ackoff, On Purposeful Systems
