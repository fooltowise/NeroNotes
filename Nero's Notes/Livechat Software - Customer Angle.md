### Could we start with your background, and we'll jump into the questions.

My background has always been around customer experience, particularly over the last 20 years, in and out of the ecommerce world. I suppose the most relevant time was while I was at IKEA; I spent 10 years in the contact center in various management roles. As you can imagine, being IKEA, we're dealing with quite a huge following of contact through various means, but LiveChat wasn't something that was in the contact center at the time. When I ventured into the ecommerce world within IKEA as the operation manager for the UK and Ireland, we knew that we were having particular problems with our checkout functionality. While waiting for a change in the web platform, I attended a meeting in Sweden where we'd have a biannual meeting with like-minded people within IKEA. One of my colleagues was based in Denmark, and one evening she was talking about LiveChat and the difference that it made in terms of their conversion rate. That was where we knew that we were struggling. I think our conversion rate at the time was 0.6% or 0.7%, something like that.

### How do you define conversion?

Conversion rate is from basket through checkout and making the sale. So for every 100 customers that came onto the website, less than one of them would check out. But of course, the reality of the IKEA website is it's not just about offering ecommerce; it's also providing information about store opening times or in-store stock availability. But across the UK and Ireland, we'd have half a million visitors per day come onto the website, and ultimately what translated into sales was hovering around the 3,000 to 3,500 mark. We knew that we could do better, and while we were having quite a big overhaul of the web platform, we knew we needed to do something differently. So one evening, my colleague gave a presentation as part of the matrix meeting. It piqued my interest, so I talked with her and returned to my team. I presented it to the country management team and said this might be something we can do as an interim gap and see where that takes us.

We had a great experience; the team in LiveChat responded quickly to any question we had, really quick regarding training and setup. We would have our catch-up with similar people in the position I was in across the globe within IKEA every month, and we would be sharing the kind of wonderful stats we had from our implementation of LiveChat. It was worthwhile.

### Did Livechat get implemented in both UK and Ireland?

Yes, so I think we had it first of all implemented in Ireland. This was to make sure it was working how we wanted it to and to get an indication of the kind of volumes. We had the LiveChat predominantly located within our checkout flow, so it was either when things were in the basket and we’d have a number of triggers that said let’s offer the customer LiveChat. For example, if they were on the basket page of the website for something like more than 60 seconds and weren't moving their mouse around, we would say hey, do you want some help? Are you stuck with anything? And we would offer that throughout the checkout process. From the basket page to billing details, to delivery details, through to the credit card page, if we felt the customers were struggling, we could offer them some support at any point. That would also give us an idea of its impact on our conversion rates.

### LiveChat, as you know, has a few different products, four of them actually. What you used or implemented was the LiveChat product or the chatbot they've been marketing more aggressively recently?

No, we had it as just the LiveChat model. As part of our implementation, we then had a team of people in the contact center that made themselves available at various stages of the day. If an agent was available to deal with a chat, if the trigger was met within the checkout flow, they would make themselves available, and then the customers could interact.

### You were introduced to LiveChat internally within IKEA. That's great. As a result of that decision or revelation, did you also evaluate other similar providers?

I considered doing that, and I’ll tell you why we didn't. I'm really about doing something simply and following a good example. I'd had this conversation with a colleague, and she had done so much hard work on this; she'd done the research. I think it had been live for three or four months, so she had researched about three companies, come back, and presented it to her management team. They went with it for their reasons why.

When I came back to the UK, the biggest thing for us was that IKEA is a very cost-conscious company; it's very much about getting value for the money. It's not about being cheap but knowing that what you're investing in does what you want and is competitive from a price perspective. I knew she had done all the hard work, and when I presented it to the country management team as something we wanted to do, I think the cost for us was around £1,200, so it wasn't expensive. From our perspective, that was a big nod, and in addition, I was able to provide them with the statistics from Denmark and the data I had from them from the conversion rate perspective.

> Also, it was much easier to interact with a customer who had utilized LiveChat, and we could see what they were doing with a different tool that would enable us to hold their hands. If, for example, they had to go on the website and then pick up the phone, then that agent can't see what that customer is doing on the screen, whereas we were able to do that. That's what made such a big difference. It's a little bit big brother-esque, but it was beneficial to see what our customers were doing and make sure we were making some changes to our website.

We also had quite a big testing team that would test to the extreme the different methods or logistics we utilized to put through the checkout. The people that are really going to test it are our customers because they will presumably do things slightly differently from how you do them when you work for an organization. So we would learn things from customers when they had particular struggles on the website. For example, in regards to putting in a billing address and a postcode or a zip code, in the UK, traditional people would put a gap between the first part of the postcode and the second part. Of course, some people put it in, and some people do not put it in. People were getting stuck because the website wasn't communicating clearly enough that we wanted them to put it in a certain way because the delivery and billing pages weren't short enough. Customers couldn't get to the message we were indicating at the top of the page. So we made a configuration so it didn’t matter whether the customer put a space in the postcode; we automated it to be configured the way we wanted. For us, that was a thing that customers reported back to us, so it was interesting to see.

### You've already highlighted at least one of the integration questions I had, the live agent's ability to pick up from wherever the customer had left off. Were there other IKEA-specific apps, or was IKEA using other apps that had to be integrated? You said at the checkout page that perhaps there were payment-related apps that had to be integrated. Were there other apps that needed to be integrated with the LiveChat front end as you implemented this?

No, we didn't at all. I think that was the beauty of it; it was such an easy application to attach. Seamless. I wished the other things that we had were so easy.

### Can you talk about the number of licenses or positions you implemented?

From memory, I think we had 15 to 20, something like that. One of the things we decided to do is we knew that some customers who were having difficulty through the website were doing one of two things. They were either going away or calling the contact center. At first, we needed to speak to the contact center and say this will save you inbound calls, and the interaction you'll have with the customers will be quite short because you can actually see where their troubles are. You don't need to take their name. You don't need to say I can’t help you because I don’t know what screen you’re on. So it was beneficial to them.

Potentially, they were receiving phone calls with problems they couldn't solve. So they might say why don't you try again, empty your basket, and go back through, or can you see any error messages. The beauty of this product was that the team could give them that complete service and stay with them as they journeyed through the whole checkout process to ensure they could complete as they wanted to.

### You said 15 to 20 licenses and mentioned up front that it initially cost £1,200?

> I think it was around that mark. For me, it was attractive, and there was an excellent ability to test. When we were testing for the new platform, we wanted to temporarily switch off LiveChat for a week and see what happened in terms of the new platform. Did we get better conversion than we did with the last? It was a good test, but the reality was that some people were used to the old platform, and when they got to the new platform, customers were taking a bit longer and were even contacting us saying have you changed your web platform? This looks a little bit different to me. We needed a more extended test, but ultimately I got the sales director saying you need to put LiveChat back on because we need to get the conversion rate sales back to where they were. We can tell customers that it's a new version of the web platform, but it's still IKEA, it's still the same service, and hopefully, it's quicker.

### That’s an interesting tweak. The ongoing payment, I’m curious, the upfront payment and the ongoing payment for your British or Irish IKEA, were you paying in US dollars or British pounds and sticking with it? Do you know?

I think we were paying in pounds. I’m sure we were.

### Okay. And I had questions about using something called recurly.com.

I've not heard of that.

### Was your contract an annual contract or on an ongoing basis?

It was monthly.

### From what I understand, another company has this methodology of collecting ongoing payments and one of the apps they use is this recurly.com. Their plan is more like a credit card for corporations. This is just my understanding. So I'm curious to see how you made that leap. But it looks like you just paid in British pounds.

Yes, we just got through the monthly invoice and paid it through our normal systems. We didn't have to register a credit card or anything like that.

### Were there a couple of things you would have liked to have had? I asked about potentially evaluating other similar providers; there are a few other providers.

I had a relationship with a colleague in Denmark before we jumped in and decided that we were going to choose LiveChat. My team and I spent some time with the team, looking at how they were using it, and learning about the ease of use and implementation. I think we’d gotten enough information in advance, and what was unusual, I suppose, is I don't think I even met anyone from LiveChat. Everything was through a Teams call or Skype, so we never actually sat face to face with anybody. Ordinarily, I like dealing with someone face to face, when I’m dealing with PayPal or whatever.

It was unusual, but I think it was quite smart because the reality of working within IKEA is that they're heavily invested in making sure that you don't need to travel somewhere. You can do it via call, then you've saved that expense, and that goes on with IKEA’s thoughts of if there’s an employee you don’t have to spend money on traveling to London then that means we can sell the IKEA products at a lower price because you do not have a huge expense bill. I think the same methodology was used at LiveChat; they were utilizing virtual meetings as opposed to face-to-face, which is commonplace around the world today. I don't have anything negative to say regarding LiveChat or making that initial decision, implementation, and taking it forward. None at all.

### Do you think their unwillingness or ability to do all this through Teams and Zoom was because of Covid-related impact, or did they implement this before?

No, this was about a year and a half beforehand, around 2018; this was how they did business.

### Were you interacting with people in Poland, or were your primary contacts in London and the UK?

I think they were in Poland.

### Now that it’s implemented in the UK and Ireland, is there a possibility of IKEA implementing this in other geographies as well?

I believe other countries did take it up. I think conversations were had with Canada because they were quite interested. It came back to these monthly matrix meetings with similar people in the ecommerce world of IKEA, where you'd be sharing your successes. We would do this with pretty much everything. If a country found that they had a better way to manage returns or whatever, you’d share an example, and people wanted to take you up on the offer and have a conversation afterward. I think we did have a conversation with Canada, and we showed them a demonstration. I think they had a trial for a while, but I don't know whether they ended up taking it up.

Of course, you say, if you're interested, here it is, we give a demonstration, this is our conversion rate, how it's done. But it's up to them to decide whether they want to take it or not. I think maybe Italy did, off the top of my head. I'm thinking about my relationships with other countries and what they were like. I think Spain may have done it, but I'm not 100% sure. I just know how progressive some countries were with their ecommerce strategy, and some were quicker to adopt as opposed to being tentative. A few other countries have used it, yes.

### How long did the implementation take?

I don't think it was longer than two months. It was so slick. So, so slick.

### Since your experience has been so positive, I'm not sure if you can put yourself in my shoes as an investor looking from the outside. As I'm looking at the company itself, what else would be more important to think about, to take into consideration? Just using IKEA’s experience as an example here.

I’m trying to go back and think about it. I believe some of the metrics from the MI that came back through LiveChat were good at the time. Still, for us, it was that excitement, like it was that new toy, whereby anything you have is okay. I think other pieces of MI were driving us to potentially adopt chatbot functionality. This would have meant that we didn't need to use so many people and resources on what were probably fairly simple reasons for LiveChat to appear in the first place.

You can identify what triggers would start a LiveChat appearing for most customers. It could be potentially smarter whereby if a customer gets a particular type of error, is on a page for too long, or is scrolling up and down, potentially the website could then say add a trigger here, almost suggesting triggers that will allow you to interact with that customer. Some people may get quite impatient, they may scroll up and down once or twice and then click off.

Potentially, LiveChat could interact and say hold on a second; we know that 10,000 customers have hit this page, and 10% are scrolling up and down; what are they looking for? Is it because of one of the CTAs, the call-to-action buttons? Maybe it's grayed out because they need to select something higher up. You might need to trigger LiveChat so customers can understand what's happening, or make something a bit more obvious, so customers know where they're going. It's about having LiveChat being a bit more intuitive, which leads into less of a LiveChat functionality and more of a web analytics tool happening before webchat is asked or is available. It could be something because, for me, it's almost like it's in tandem.

We used to utilize a different tool called SessionCam, if you've heard of them, or Contentsquare. Those organizations would do a scrape of all of your website so they could map. They could say, if you've gone to this website, I can see where he started, every single touch point he went to. I can see how much time he spent looking at tables and chairs and mattresses or whatever, and I can see where he exited. Not just seeing the pages you visited but also being able to physically see a recording of what you were doing. So if, for example, you were hovering over an image or a video attached to a page wasn't working, we could see it through SessionCam or Contentsquare. You could identify that this customer was doing this, and actually, this doesn't work. So you could try and replicate it, determine whether you were using your cellphone, laptop, desktop, or whatever, and go and fix those things.

Have a look at SessionCam and Contentsquare. Some of the analytics they can do lend themselves to whether customers are experiencing this, and if you can't fix it quickly, you can put in a LiveChat intervention. That way, while you are developing something that might take two or three months to do, you're helping customers that are hitting that barrier that means that they can’t progress or that they don't know how to navigate forward to the next place that you want them to go through to. That's quite a big add-on, but as an investor, maybe look at SessionCam and Contentsquare or speak to LiveChat. Perhaps you say, can you amalgamate some of the functionality you have here, invest in another organization with that part, and put them together?

### Not having that in LiveChat, has that impeded any of your processes, or was that something you ended up missing due to switching?

No, but the rationale was that we'd got SessionCam and Contentsquare before we took LiveChat on board. If LiveChat came on and said, we've got this complete package, we would say how does it compare to SessionCam and Contentsquare. If it can do pretty much what they can, then you've got an all-in-one solution. SessionCam and Contentsquare didn't have a webchat function, and there was no interaction with the customer; all you could do was see what they were doing. So you couldn't directly interact and solve the customer’s problem there and then. You were maybe looking at it at the end of the day and saying a number of customers have hit this page, and there's been some kind of a struggle because they’ve been on it for 45 minutes or an hour.

### Did you end up canceling your subscription to both?

No. Interestingly, Contentsquare ended up securing that video recording software, so we ended up leaving SessionCam, and Contentsquare gave us wonderful web analytics through a series of heatmaps. It gave us video recording and error logs across the website. What error logs are being presented to every customer, and on what page were they being presented? We could replicate that and see what the customer did to generate the error in the first place. Then we could speak to the developers and say we need to either change the error message so it means something instead of saying syntax error or remove the need for that error to appear in the first place.

It was about that kind of advancement, so had LiveChat been that kind of software technology company, it's about how you then diversify what you've got available. You've got your core product, and you're able to bolt on these appendages, which means you can enhance your offering to more customers.

### LiveChat has smartly stayed away from many of these areas, but they allow their app to be integrated with many other apps. Their API gets used quite extensively on the other side. I'll check with them about Contentsquare; I had not heard about that before. That's a very interesting viewpoint. As a user, I am seeing this from the outside. This is the benefit of talking to somebody like you who's implemented and used this and knows the pros and cons. It looks like there were fewer cons than pros.

Absolutely.

### Outside of that, I wanted to ask about with whom you were interacting, but you didn’t have a specific management team.

I can't recall. It was a lady, and she was definitely from Poland because it wasn't a name that rolled off the tongue, but I can't recall her name.

### On the payment side, you said that you knew about the upfront payment, and there was some ongoing monthly charge. You said you signed up for 15 to 20 seats.

Yes.

### Is that something that increased over time, or is that what you started with and just stuck with?

We started with that purely based on the need to secure the resource from the contact center. It wasn't like we could go to them and say we needed this amount; it was what we had free and available. Those 20 agents wouldn't always be online at the same time together. They'd be shared across the day based on demand, but we would share with them when we had web traffic. Obviously, you'd see a peak during lunchtime and after five o'clock. In the call center, you might have similar peaks in terms of inbound call volume, but you don't see the same peaks in email traffic. Email traffic tends to happen later into the evening and overnight. We worked very closely with them to ensure that we fully utilized the resource.

You have to be mindful that if there was a big campaign or a big problem with distribution, then potentially you might have a whole day where nobody can go onto LiveChat, which impacts us. It’s a balance of you providing customer service to customers who have placed an order with us and providing customer experience for those who have yet to place an order with us. It's about having that careful balance. We worked closely with the call-in center to make sure that they had adequate training because our team was kind of the specialists, the ecommerce team. I think two or three of my team actually did the proper training at LiveChat, and then they rolled out the training to the 20 or so agents in the contact center.

Every day we would look at the stats as to who'd been online, how long for, how many interactions they had taken, and how many had been successful conversion rates, so we could very clearly see where we were and how we were performing. We were also mindful that if we saw that no one had been on there, we would try to understand if there was a problem in the LiveChat or the call center because there was no time to take people there. It was always this kind of bolt-on, but this was a proactive way of dealing with customer service instead of a reactive, where the customer is contacting you. You're almost saying to them it looks like you need some help; I can help you, as opposed to that customer calling up and potentially having to wait in a queue.

### Did your contact person or somebody else from LiveChat approach you about a chatbot?

No. Again, I don’t recall it being available.

### That could have been it. You said it was a year and a half before Covid hit, so 2016 or 2015?

It would have been 2018, I think, four years ago.

### Yes, it was in its early stages; maybe that's part of the reason. If they were to present an additional product like a chatbot today, would that interest IKEA?

> Definitely, and it's because I very much believe in having that ability to do automation to ensure your customers can have a faster experience. I did some work for LEGO about four months ago, looking at the chatbot they had in place. You'd think LEGO would have had a chatbot for ages, but they'd only had it since Christmas. When I did a deep interrogation of their chatbot to identify what worked well and what didn't, they were saying that Sofia, the chatbot, managed to clear about 7% of interactions. I said that's a great opportunity because that's nowhere near where I would expect it to be.

I would suspect it to be at least around the 40% mark. It's around how you're utilizing all of your different contact methods. Using what you'd get on social media and through your emails and content, you build this library that your chatbot can accurately pull from. You've got to have a team of people solely managing that chatbot for the first six months to ensure that you give her enough knowledge. It wasn't something they had been doing at that particular stage, but they looked at it. They had five or six different people from different areas providing various insights, and I said it doesn't work for you. You've got to have a team of people focusing on it for the first six months to drive the performance of that chatbot to where you want it to be. You also have to have a team of two people, based on the number of interactions you're getting, to be on there full-time, ensuring that everything is being refreshed.

They were releasing products and opening new stores every week, so it was essential to ensure that that chatbot was as smart as possible so she wouldn't end up saying, it looks like I can't help you; I'll forward you on to another adviser. I'm a big believer in chatbots, not just as a customer but as someone who has gone through live functionality.

### The 7% that you just referenced, what's the computation? How do you arrive at that 7%?

They provided me with that statistic, so essentially, it was about 10,000 chats a month, and at the end of the chat, it would ask the question, have we managed your query today? I did slightly challenge this in terms of their 7%; it could be double, and it could be higher than that because the reality is that you can ignore it as a user. You don't have to select yes or no; it's just on the side of your desktop or on your smartphone so that you can click the X, and you haven’t responded one way or the other.

### That wouldn't be included in the 7%. That's pretty interesting. As you left Sofia, did you leave them with LiveChat as an option, or did you just say you've got to have a different approach?

No, Sofia was their internal system. They had created it with their own internal developers, and I worked with them for probably six months. They started in December; I did a piece of work with them in June for a couple of days to deep dive into what Sofia is doing, what her limitations are, and what she could do better, then left them to it. I need to revisit it and see how she's doing.

### One final question: Is there an issue or two that would turn you off in terms of LiveChat? Assume you were still at IKEA UK and Ireland, and there was a specific issue or two that popped up due to LiveChat, either from LiveChat or the integration with IKEA; what would it be? What would turn you off?

> A couple of things. The first is reliability if I'm experiencing high amounts of downtime. But also, when we would ask a question with the support team, we got a response within two or three hours. It was so fast, so, so fast. So I suppose it would have been frustrating if those weren't there, not just looking at it from a customer perspective. Many customers didn't expect it to be there; the fact that it had been there in the past and they got to the page, and they want to utilize LiveChat, and it's not there, then it ends with them being frustrated. They would miss using it because it had been there to hold their hand in the past. That would turn me off.

### It would have been really interesting had you compared LiveChat with a couple of other options and said this is why I picked LiveChat. We’ll leave it there, but before concluding this call, as an outsider, investor or not, what else do you think might be of interest as I walk away from this conversation related to LiveChat that we haven't covered?

They should consider whether they want to expand and diversify, instead of being attached to another API, and become that all-encompassing product; a product where you can see what the customers are doing far in advance. Then, based on the analytics you can see, you can make recommendations for utilizing the LiveChat gateway so your customers have a much smoother service. It's about being ahead of the game.

I understand that LiveChat has become the specialists in what they do, and I don't know whether they have ever decided to dip their toe into expanding the analytics side of things. That might be a longer integration time. Maybe they have looked at that in the past and decided it's not for us; it moves too far away from our core product and the intent we've got around LiveChat, so we want to stick to what we know. I don’t know whether they have ruled it out, but that’s my input.

### They've got four products now, LiveChat being the primary one. The chatbot is their faster-growing unit, and they‘ve got a couple more. HelpDesk and KnowledgeBase. I understand they are thinking about at least one, maybe more than one new product; maybe that is the answer to your point. We'll see; only time will tell. This is exceptionally helpful.

Good.

### I’ve not had a chance to talk to an actual customer who implemented LiveChat and had the experience, so I thank you, and InPractise, for taking the time to speak with me.

You're welcome; I enjoyed that as well. Good conversation.
