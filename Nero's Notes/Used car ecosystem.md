### Joe, how would you describe the used car ecosystem?

It is very dynamic but a lot of what happens in the used car ecosystem is set in motion by the way it was sold as a new car. There are two primary channels in the United States because around the world it functions differently. With the exception of Tesla, a new car has to be sold by a franchised new car dealer and there are laws and regulation around the delivery and sale of those vehicles. Franchised new car dealers purchase new cars from the factory which produces them and sell them on their lots.

The other channel is more commercial where those new cars sold by franchised dealers are primarily sold to consumers like you and I. There are many new cars sold into commercial fleets, be it rental cars, government or business fleets. A government might have a fleet of trucks they use to service a municipality.

They are primarily financed, with very few sold for cash as not many people can afford to do that in this country as the cost and price of a new car has continually increased. The average price of a new car is $35,000. The other method is leasing, where the residual value of that car at the end of the lease is taken off the top of the total MSRP for that vehicle, with the balance being financed. It is like a long-term rental. Those are the two main ways cars are sold in this country; either financed by a bank or leased. There are other edge cases how cars are used.

We are seeing some subscription models but those are just getting started. I will focus primarily on financing and leasing. Once that car is in the hands of a consumer and is driven, a financed car average loan period is over 60 months or five years. Generally, a consumer who finances a car for that long will get tired of it before the finance term is up. You want a new car every couple of years so that car is traded in. Those trade-ins enter the used car ecosystem and can be resold in several ways.

The dealer who takes that trade-in can keep it and resell it as a used car on their lot. If that year/make/model is not appealing he will move it into the wholesale ecosystem in several ways. The primary method is through an auction and, until recently, those were mostly physical. The dealer transports the car to a physical Manheim or ADESA auction, which are the two biggest players. Other used car dealers bid on that car and buy it to take back to their used car lot to resell.

We have recently seen some disruption in that car dealer to auction marketplace, from upstarts who are enabling that whole car auction to take place online. There are a dozen or more in North America. The one that gets the most press is ACV, but ADESA has their own solution called Trade Rev and Manheim has Manheim Express. There are a handful of other smaller players such as BacklotCars, Appraisal Lane and CARWAVE. The premise behind digital wholesale auctions is the dealer doesn't have to take the time or effort to transport the car to the physical auction. It can be sold at wholesale right on the dealer's lot, with an app on your smart phone. You take the pictures with your smart phone and launch the car into an online auction, right from your dealership.

That is just getting started in this country but it’s growing and will disrupt physical whole car auction businesses. Once that car reaches a physical or digital wholesale auction, other used car dealers bid on it because they are looking for inventory to supply their used car lots.

### What can Trade Rev or ACV do to be so much more efficient? You mentioned the dealer doesn't have to transport the car to the auction; is that the auctioneer's responsibility or does the dealer have to pay for it in some way?

It is the dealer's responsibility to get that vehicle to the used car physical auction and it is both time consuming and costly. The way around that, if you are still keen on selling your car at a physical auction, is to involve the services of a wholesaler. There is an entire industry around physical used car auctions from service providers who make their living by picking up cars from used car dealers and taking them to auction. You can outsource that process of selling used cars at auction by using a middle man which is a wholesaler, who will arrive with a flat-bed truck or car hauler, load up the used cars you do not want to sell and take them to a physical auction.

Generally, it is the responsibility of the selling dealer to get that used car to the physical auction. Only half of the cars offered on any given auction day sell. They are either not what buyers are looking for, the price is too high or the condition is too rough. Even if you take the time to transport your vehicles and spend the money to get your cars to auction, there is no guarantee they will sell.

### You were about to mention the second channel, the commercial side of the ecosystem.

The other way a new car gets into the used car ecosystem is through sale by the factory to fleets, which is a huge business in this country. There are several large companies who manage fleets for businesses, such as ARI, Element and LeasePlan. They buy cars from manufacturers and put them into service for their commercial entity customers who need cars to run their businesses. The other way is those cars are sold new into rental car fleets. Some rental car companies buy the cars outright and some lease them.

Generally, what happens with fleet cars is the asset gets depreciated. Unlike a consumer, who may want to trade their car in every few years for a new one because they are bored with their old one or want the new features and gadgetry, better fuel economy and safety, those fleet cars mostly go to auction because they are not the type of vehicle from a mileage condition standpoint a consumer wants to buy.

One notable exception is Enterprise Rental Cars who run their own dealer lots called Enterprise Car Sales. They take the best of their rental car fleet and sell direct to consumers. That model has been attempted by other rental car companies such as Hertz, who tried it for a while but have recently closed all their sales locations. There is a notion among the rental car companies that they ought to be able to do it themselves but they are really not good at it. Enterprise have been the most successful at taking cars out of their rental car fleets and selling them to consumers. Generally speaking, a vehicle is sold by the factory into a fleet.

Whether that is a managed fleet by a company like ARI or Element, or a self-managed fleet like a rental car fleet or a government fleet, those cars are used up. Their life cycle at the point of sale is at a point where a consumer probably would not buy that car and they get sold at auction. That does not mean they do not end up in the hands of consumers, but the way they end up there is from the auction to a used car dealer. Many of them end up at independent used car dealers, because independent used car dealers do not have as much capital to expend on stocking their inventory with late model lower mileage more expensive cars. Their target for buying used cars is more down market.

### There are three channels a used car is funnelled into the ecosystem; the grounding dealer who takes back a leased vehicle, the captive FinCo or new franchise dealer network, and the whole car auctions which end up having some commercial dealer vehicles.

You touch on an interesting point when you bring up leasing, because that sits in the middle. Leased cars are sold by a franchised dealer. They are not financed but leased and there is a whole separate ecosystem in place to handle those off lease units. The two major players in the whole car space are ADESA and Manheim who have separate systems in place with leasing companies to deal with those cars. I prefer to treat leasing separately because the car and the process is unique. It is different from the financed side where, typically, the car is traded in by the consumer.

That off lease vehicle has a deadline. When you lease that car, you are signing up via contract with the manufacturer to only put a certain number of miles on it. There is a penalty if you do more. You typically sign a 24, 36 or 48 month lease term and you know there is a deadline on that car. Generally speaking, while some consumers buy their car off lease, most of the time they have leased a car because they want another new car at the end of their lease term. That leased vehicle comes back into the OEM franchised network as a known quantity. By that I mean, you know, generally, how many miles are going to be on it. You know the condition of the car because it has been maintained at the franchised dealer as part of the leasing contract.

### So you know the residual value?

That is the third point; you know the residual value of that car and when that car comes back to the grounding dealer – and grounding dealer is a term that simply means where the leased vehicle is turned in – they have a right of first refusal. The dealer can look at that vehicle and say, yes this is a really good used car, I can sell this in a heartbeat. It has low mileage, was well-maintained and is accident free. The person had no kids or dogs, and did not smoke. That is a cream puff and grounding dealers will cherry pick those off lease units. There are also incentives offered by OEMs, to dealer franchised networks, to pick up those off leased cars.

Certified pre-owned is one of those incentives. The dealer pays to certify that car, but then you get that certified brand which means a lot to a consumer. You also get an extended warranty and can charge a premium when you sell that used car. It is kind of a middle ground between a used car and a new car. It has a warranty that is as good as or better, in some cases, than a new car warranty. The factory stands behind it, they have inspected it and that CPO certification adds a lot of value to that used car in the marketplace. So that grounding dealer is the first step in the off lease used car ecosystem.

If the grounding dealer already has too many silver Camrys on their lot it goes to a closed network where other Toyota dealers in the franchised network are next in line to purchase it. That takes place online and both ADESA and Manheim run white labelled, online platforms for that process. Those online processes are things the factory or leasing company take advantage of, to help them manage that process of grounding to closed network and beyond.

### Do you think new business models, like Carvana, can enter the ecosystem and start sourcing some of this inventory?

The simple answer is it is too early to tell, but factories and leasing companies who have these leased cars on their books, are looking for the most cost-effective and lucrative way to see that car through to its next owner. If Carvana, by offering that vehicle either to a dealer network, a used car dealer network, or direct to the public, can do it for less and if they're selling to the public, get a retail price for that car, the factories are going to be all over that. The simple fact of the matter is that ADESA and Manheim are the two most expensive places to dispose of and purchase a used car at auction, in this country.

### Why is that?

Until recently, they had a duopoly on the market. They were the two largest players, sharing 60% of the marketplace for used cars sold at auction. They also had systems, processes and infrastructure in place to make it easier for buyers and sellers to exchange used cars. They also earned the trust of sellers and buyers in that they will stand behind the transaction if the car turns out to be not what the buyer expected. If there was something wrong with it that the seller didn't know, they will stand behind that transaction and help arbitrate between buyer and seller, to either unwind the deal or find a compromise to allow the transaction to go through. For example, the price could be reduced or they could agree to fix the car.

On the commercial side, the contracts between the sellers and big auction houses are multiple year and are negotiated through RFP and, therefore, difficult to unwind. You cannot simply say, I'm out; you would have to find somewhere else to sell your cars which is not easy. There is also the difficulty of unwinding those commercial relationships. On the other hand, a used car dealer can decide, week in week out, where to dispose of their used cars.

### Is that why they have turn inventory much quicker?

That is exactly right. If you talk about Carvana insinuating themselves into the off lease marked, it is not something lease providers can flip a switch and do, but it is something they will certainly consider. That has just started taking place. The other motivator behind entities like Carvana, Vroom and CarMax is that if they find a way to source cars more efficiently and cost-effectively, they will, because that adds to their bottom line when they sell that car at retail. There is an incentive there on the cost side.

### What is the difference if you break down the unit cost of selling the car on ADESA versus Carvana? How would you look at the components of that?

It could be hundreds of dollars on an individual vehicle, and there are millions of cars that change hands at auction, just at Manheim and ADESA.

### Is that because of the network density?

It is due to network density and just the volume of turnover in used cars, in this country. By order of magnitude, it’s three times the volume of new cars sold. Last year, just over 17 million new cars were sold in the US whereas over 40 million used cars were sold. The volume of that inventory changing hands makes it a very lucrative marketplace.

### Carvana could have a unit cost advantage because they could have much more scale in the inventory they turn and, therefore, more density, more locations, a lower unit cost of selling the vehicle and a higher price from a larger buyer network, more importantly.

Higher price because they are selling some of those cars directly to retail and when a car is sold at auction to a used car dealer it is a two-hop process before it gets back to retail. The used car dealer has to buy it from the seller, has costs involved with getting to the auction or getting the car they purchased at auction back to their lot. Most used car dealers finance the purchase of used cars. They also have to maintain that car while they are trying to sell it. It has to be washed, vacuumed and made showroom ready every week. If it rains, they have to wash it again.

### If we play this forward a decade, what would be the reason that Carvana would not have those relationships or a large proportion of inventory from big leasing companies?

There is no reason they will not be very successful at cracking that market open. The changes taking place on the retail side are no less dramatic than on the wholesale side, but consumers have never liked purchasing a car from a new car dealer. It is an onerous process and takes all day which is why online shopping platforms are so successful. You do not have to go to three, four or five different car lots to find what you are looking for. You can find it online and zero in on exactly the vehicle you want, the price, color and features. You still have to go there and go through the unpleasant purchase process.

Some companies have made really good inroads into taking some of the drama out of buying a car from a dealer. CarMax are probably the most notable because they have done a good job advertising their no-haggle price and their sales people are salaried and not paid commissions. They have a defined process – trade your car in or they will buy it outright – you do not have to buy a car from them. They will write you a check that day. Carvana not only have an advantage with their ecosystem and infrastructure, but consumers prefer the online shopping purchase process.

They do not have dealerships; they deliver the car to you. They have their own bank you can get financing from and do not have to go through the sales process in the F&I office trying to decide which loan you want or if you need gap insurance, mud flaps or a bed liner on your truck.

### What is the biggest risk with the Carvana model?

One of their biggest risks they are trying to solve is sourcing. Used car inventory is in short supply. New car factories were shut down this Spring because of COVID and they stopped making new cars. It is hard to find a new car, especially if you want a particular make/model/color or feature set. So used cars are in demand.

### Price goes up.

Price goes up and it is harder to find that good quality used car.

### Dealers want to sell directly to retail and not via these Carvanas of the world?

Consumers are looking to swap out their vehicle and new cars are in short supply so the next place to go is a used car. The other dynamic affecting that is new cars are expensive whereas used cars are more affordable. In uncertain economic times, consumers want to save money. They want a good quality car but one with low mileage. Carvana, CarMax and all used car dealers have to compete for that inventory. Competition is good for auction houses but not good for dealers because it bids up the used car price.

The other risk is the cycles of recovery and recession which happen in this country. We were spoiled over the past 12 years – it was all sunshine and blue skies – there was no recession. Those cycles, generally, occur naturally and on a fairly regular basis. Economic cycles depress new and used car sales so that is a risk.

### Obviously all businesses have some volatility or risk to their average selling price of used vehicles, but how can a Carvana be more resilient?

Carvana is trying to become efficient by approaching the process of sourcing, reconditioning and selling vehicles using Six Sigma methodologies. Take out all of the waste in this used car ecosystem and be as efficient as possible. They are centralizing reconditioning facilities. They do not have to own land on which to park cars and then sell them. They have centralized that process and sell cars virtually. They borrow money efficiently.

They borrow money to buy these cars and spread out the risk of that borrowing across the whole country, across a big chunk of inventory, in multiple markets. This country has economic cycles but some parts are hit harder than others in a downturn and some recover faster in an upturn, so they are spreading their risk out across the whole country. They are efficient in building their supply chain and processes, using data and analytics to decide which cars to buy and how to price the cars they sell, to avoid sitting with inventory. They use data and analytics to find the sweet spot of which cars to purchase at auction or directly from consumers and how to price them when they sell them online.

### In your mind, is there any reason why Carvana would fail? It seems like in the long run, if they have the biggest network offering sellers a higher profitability it is a no-brainer.

You hit the nail on the head and why their stock has done so well since they went public. There is a risk of them biting off more than they can chew and trying to grow too fast. There is a risk they borrow too much money, buy too many cars and the economy takes another bad spin due to COVID. They could probably weather that as they are a publicly traded company and have access to financial markets for loans. They have built up good infrastructure with wide and deep moats around their business. There are a few others in that space, like CarMax, who will now deliver your car to you.

### Where does the advantage come in the long run?

The advantage comes from being a first mover; Carvana have been at this for a long time. People have seen a lot more of them recently because of their advertising and their delivery trucks driving around in major metro markets. By going public, they got much more press but they have been at this for years and they have been learning as they go. CarMax have also been at this for a while. Some others have come and gone. Vroom recently got much press so there is also the risk of competition.

There are big publicly traded new car franchise dealer groups starting to look at this model and they are selling cars online and delivering them.

### What is the real advantage because if consumers are moving online, the dealers will have to also move online eventually. These are not traditional dealers like AutoNation and Lithia; how would you run that business today versus Carvana?

All those businesses are looking at what Carvana and CarMax are doing and, to the extent they can, are emulating those business practices. They are moving online. AutoNation has made investments in some of these upstarts. They have invested in Vroom are will evolve their business to be online to the extent that they can. They have started AutoNation used car only stores. They have started AutoNation auctions selling cars at wholesale. They are looking at the Carvana and CarMax models and implementing pieces of those playbooks themselves.

Another risk to Carvana is that the big publicly traded dealer groups figure this out.

### What is it that could provide a sustained competitive advantage for Carvana? Is it their logistics infrastructure or the relationships they have to source inventory or eventually just the national scale of buyer networks to purchase the vehicles?

Much of the online marketplace for used vehicles is determined by the kind of inventory you are dealing with. The first tranche of that inventory is off lease which is a known quantity. You know how many miles are on it, you know it has been serviced by the factory, you know the residual value. That is a car you can buy and sell online all day. You do not have to go to a physical auction and put your hands on that car to test drive it or listen to it run. The only risk to purchasing that car online is, did somebody smoke in it? Or did they have pets and it smells?

You can buy and sell that late model, low mileage, great condition off lease car all day online. The same can be said for the cars coming off rental car fleets. They will use that car up to a certain point, but they have been well maintained and serviced because they have to be in order to be rented. They have to be safe. That is a really good used car. Many used car dealers source cars from rental fleets. Those can be bought and sold online all day, every day.

At the other end of the spectrum are rough, high mileage older cars that sell for $2,000, $3,000, $4,000 at wholesale. How wrong can you be on that car? If you buy a $30,000 car and something is wrong with it you could be wrong by $10,000. You are only going to be slightly off on that car because of the price and you know it has been driven for 100,000 miles. I live in a house which was built in 1910. It has been here 110 years and will probably be here for another 110. Well-built, solid and it’s lasted this long; it will probably be around for a while

That 100,000-mile car had a bunch of stuff replaced. It has been maintained pretty well or it would not have gone that far. At the price point you can purchase that $2,000 to $4,000 car, how wrong can you be? It is those cars in the middle that are not certified or pre-owned eligible. They are not the most pristine of the off lease or off rental or trade-ins, but they are also not these rough older higher mileage cars. The cars in the middle are where the physical auction space still has legs and where there is still much competition between buyers and sellers. The sellers to dispose of and the buyers to find that inventory. That middle tranche of vehicles is where you will see the disruption. The late model, newer, lower-mileage cars, that’s going to go digital no question. The lower end of the scale, whether it’s salvage or low-cost cars being sold at auction, that will go digital.

### What is the typical source of those cars in the middle?

That is where I see a lot of disruption and it is anybody's guess as to how that all plays out. The physical auctions still have an advantage because if you think about that middle tranche of vehicles in a bell curve, that is where the volume is.

### Are these typically financed cars?

These are financed cars and the rougher of the off lease, off rental, off fleet. They are cars that have possibly been bought and sold in the used car market several times.

### If Carvana finds a way to validate cars online, could it be pretty powerful?

I think it could but it would not be my first choice as Carvana to go after that market. There are four million cars leased annually in this country; 30% of the new car market. There is so much inventory in that low mileage, off lease category that Carvana can make a ton of money without looking elsewhere. From a consumer's standpoint, you are better off offering that low mileage, late model, off lease inventory.

### Because I know the residual value?

Yes, I know the residual value and it is more appealing to consumers because it is a later model with more bells and whistles such as airbags, anti-lock brakes, Bluetooth and USB ports and will be more appealing to carvana.com shoppers.

### Focusing more on whole car auctions at ADESA and Manheim, how do you compare institutional versus dealer relationships with auction houses?

There are two key differences. Those institutional relationships are contracted through RFP processes and once you go through that RFP process as a leasing company or a captive finance company or a bank like Chase or Wells Fargo, you are locked in and committed to a tranche of inventory to an ADESA or Manheim or wherever you choose to sell those cars. Because you committed a certain volume of vehicles, you received price concessions from that auction house. For all intents and purposes, you are locked in for the period of that contract. The auction house likes it because they can count on that inventory. They can staff their auctions, maintain their infrastructure and know exactly how much land and facilities they need to process those auctions.

### How is the pricing set with institutional sellers?

They are negotiated starting, with volume.

### Per car?

Per car, yes; in the industry it is called RPU or revenue per unit. If you listen to an ADESA or KAR quarterly earnings call, you will hear that phrase a lot; your RPU is X. It is a blended number; they do not break out individual components of that revenue per unit but they can count on that revenue because they have contracted with Chase Auto Finance to get X thousand cars annually through their auctions. That is the commercial side and the same thing happens with big rental car fleets. They know the quantity of cars in their fleet and the depreciation structure, from an accounting standpoint. They know the miles those cars have driven because it is all tracked online. When you check your car out and back in after your rental, they are keeping track.

### I assume that the dealers are slightly different?

The dealers are completely different. If you went back 20 years before autotrader.com, CarMax, Carvana, Vroom and ACV online auctions, the dealers had three choices. Take a car in on trade, keep it or sell it. Take it to the auction or call a wholesaler to come and get it. Those were the only options I had. Today, there are several apps like ACV, Trade Rev and Manheim Express to launch the car into an auction. They can sell it themselves, online, call their wholesaler or go to auction, but auctions have changed.

Large enough used car dealers will have the auction come to them. They will send a mobile auction to the dealer and run it on their lot.

### All they care about is the gross profit per vehicle?

They care about that, but they also care about time.

### Turning it quicker.

They want to turn them over quicker because it is time consuming to go to auction as they are not guaranteed they will all sell. Conversion at a used car auction hovers around 50%. Recently it has been much higher here because of COVID and the demand for used cars.

### I assume that is driven by the buyer network?

Exactly; they have to plan which cars to stock in order to meet local demand.

### How would you segment buyers for whole car auctions?

There are only a handful. There are big institutions like Carvana, CarMax and AutoNation who have entire departments devoted to buying cars at wholesale, regardless of whether they source them directly from consumers, off lease or from auctions. They use data and analytics to know exactly what sells on their lots and the turnover. They also know exactly what they should pay for a car of a certain age, mileage or condition.

### Is that an advantage?

It is a huge advantage to know exactly what to look for. Their buyers are given a buy sheet which they are not to stray from. These are the cars to look for, at these prices.

### Can they bid more?

There is a range, so for example a 2015 Camry LE, you should bid between $12,000 and $14,000. If you go over that, you need to have a valid reason.

### Surely everyone knows the residual value of a typical car?

They do for the most part, but remember that the big buyers have so much money. They buy cars before they ever hit the lane. There is a process at whole car auctions where there is a buy it now price. That car never runs through the lane. The seller puts a price on it, the buyer looks at that price and decides they can make money on a car with this mileage in this condition, at that price point.

### Playing through this a few more steps, as Carvana keep scaling the buyer network ensuring they have more demand than individual public physical dealers, does that then enable them to bid more and win more inventory? As they scale on the demand side, how does that affect their ability to source inventory?

The simple answer is, you never want to over pay. Buyers and sellers of cars at wholesale have more data and analytics than previously due to the internet, business intelligence systems and machine learning, but so does the consumer. When shopping for a particular used car, in a defined geography, the consumer knows, within a certain range, what that car is worth. A dealer who overpays relative to what that consumer is willing to pay will sit with that car for a while. It is a very interesting and dynamic marketplace because discovery of the pricing and availability of used cars is all in flux. These systems are relatively new; less than five years.

### Can we go back to how you would categorize the buyers on whole-car auction sites?

We started talking about buyers and wanting to characterize segments for those buyers. I started with the big institutional buyers such as Carvana, CarMax and AutoNation. The next step down from that are franchise dealers who may have a handful of rooftops. They are not an AutoNation but nor are they Joe's Used Cars. They run a franchise store and may have three or four brands on several lots. They have floor plan financing and a good line of credit to buy cars. They do not have as much money as a CarMax but they are doing okay. They go to auctions and compete with other buyers for those vehicles.

They are generally pretty savvy and have a used car department with a manager. They may not have a dedicated role for a used car buyer, but many of them do, and they know what they are doing and are much more sophisticated. Then you have other big independents, like US Auto Sales and Driveline who take trade-ins but also need to source inventory from wholesale. Then you have independent small mom and pop dealers, who are dependent on auctions for most of their inventory. They do not sell new cars so do not get as many trade-ins.

Within that small independent category, there are buy here pay here dealers, who basically rent cars to consumers whose credit is such that they cannot get a car loan. They garnish their wages in order to pay $100 a week for a car to drive. Those dealers primarily source inventory at the lower end of the spectrum. That is how I would characterize buyers. You have big networks, franchises, independents, smaller independents and mom and pops, who all source cars at wholesale. They are now also starting to source cars online through these dealer-to-dealer apps.

They also source cars directly from wholesalers. Wholesalers are in a middle man role where they are the go between, between dealers who take trade-ins they do not want to sell and auction houses. They also sell cars to dealers and, in a local market, will know who is taking in trades of a certain type and who is selling them. They service that market independently from big auction houses and millions of cars change hands in that way, annually.

### If I am a franchised dealer who purchases a car from ADESA at an average selling price of $10,000. How much would I pay and what would be the price components?

First you have to get to the auction. You could be buying online, sitting in your office, watching a simulcast or bidding online on adesa.com or manheim.com, but you have to do your research. You have to know what you are shopping for and what you should pay for that car. There is some homework you need to do to prepare for that auction which means time and money. If you go to physical auction, you have to take some time to inspect the cars you want to bid on, by looking at run lists. You might get that run list from next week's auction ahead of time so you know what is on offer at ADESA Indianapolis next Tuesday.

You have to look at those cars and make your short list of 100 cars and decide which 10 to bid on. Then you have to think through, here is the price that has been set for that car; how much over that am I willing to go? Going back to my homework of my data and analytics, what is selling on my lot, and for what? I know I shouldn’t pay more than X amount for this vehicle. Then I have to attend the auction and get caught up in the frenzy of cars running through lanes and everybody else bidding, which is something the sellers are counting on. It is one of the things where physical auctions still have a hold on buyers. Whole car auctions are exciting and crazy but also fun and there is a social element to it.

It is fun to hang out with other used car dealers you have known for many years. There is a social element to it but there is also competition and that car will get bid up. You have to make a decision there and then as to whether you want to buy that car or not. You might pay cash for it but, more than likely, you have a floor plan and are borrowing money to buy it, so there is the cost of that borrowed money. You then have to get that car back to your dealer lot so there is a transport cost. You also have to maintain that car on your lot. Other cost components might be improving some things on that car before it comes back to your dealership.

### What are the biggest drivers of revenue per vehicle sold in physical auctions?

The two biggest drivers are buyer and seller fees. The seller fees for commercial accounts are negotiated so that is a contracted fee.

### Is that pretty low because they obviously have the inventory?

They have the inventory and are committing long term. They are also, in most cases, buying a bundle of services. Each car I sell at ADESA or Manheim, I want washed and vacuumed. Put new tires on it, take out all the dents and spray the front and back bumpers if they are damaged.

### Going back to the Carvana approach, how important are those services?

Very important. Carvana are building mini factories that look a lot like the reconditioning facilities at big auction houses. There is 300 feet of bays where cars get serviced with jacks and machinery.

### Is there any gross margin earned by ADESA on reconditioning for sellers, or is that done at cost, in order to get the inventory?

Typically there is an ROI and a calculation a seller does, which the auction houses help with that calculus. There is a five-point rating system at big auctions houses where 5 is the best and 1 is the worst. They see vehicles with a condition grade of 4 to 4.5 getting a 10% bump in proceeds and most cars are a 3.5. We want to bump them up to a 4 and this is what we recommend. Put new tires on, spray the bumpers, pull the dents, wash and vacuum. For cars which are rougher than that, we will send you the results of our inspection and let you decide.

That all takes place between seller and auction house, at every auction. The seller is contracted for a bundle of services which include a few things but there will always be outliers. There are cars which will need more work than others. Auction houses help with data and analytics to give their big commercial seller customers that ROI on the reconditioning, because they have margin on that reconditioning too; they are making money.

### So they are making a small margin on reconditioning the tires and so forth. Going back to Carvana's approach, it is very difficult to get real advantages in reconditioning and putting tires onto a vehicle, therefore winning commercial business is about the scale and buyer demand they could potentially have in five to 10 years.

Also the saleability of vehicles coming off leases. They don’t need much work; they only need to be washed, vacuumed and maybe some tires replaced.

### What else is the core driver of that $800 to $900 revenue per vehicle for physical auctions?

What we have spoken about are the services which sellers take advantage of. They buy reconditioning services, tires and dent removal.

### Is that a couple of hundred bucks or what is roughly the figure for that service by ADESA?

Yes, give or take, and the same thing happens on the buyer side. If the buyer sources late model, off lease cars he may choose none of the services and simply load up the car and send it home. He might want to buy some set of reconditioning services post sale, such as a post-sale inspection. The car was inspected before it was sold but a more thorough inspection can be done to know exactly what he has signed up for. He might buy insurance on that car which is a fee to bring the car back outside of arbitration.

The insurance policy says, if I get this car back and something is wrong with it, you will take it back, no questions asked. You can also take advantage of the two big auction houses owning their own finance companies. ADESA owns Automotive Finance Company or AFC and Manheim owns NextGear Capital. You can borrow money from the auction house to buy cars at their auctions. You pay a fee for that and the auction house makes money by lending it to you.

### Has the core auction fee increased over the years?

Yes, it has increased quite a lot and has probably reached a point close to topping out. There is not a lot of head room in increasing buy and sell fees, which is why they are being creative and coming up with many other ways to add services for additional fees. Things like making the photos which were taken before auction available to the buying dealer. When he gets the car back to his lot, he already has the photos and does not have to pay someone else. There may be a warranty on the car.

I can buy a warranty which is transferable to the consumer. There are many creative ways of adding service fees that auction houses are coming up with. Transportation; they contract with the dealer buying cars at auction to ship them for the dealer. That is especially important in the new virtual online auctions because dealers are not going to auctions with their haulers. They can purchase the logistics service as part of the auction fee.

### Why is the online revenue per vehicle $150, compared with $900 for physical?

There are several reasons for that. One of the biggest costs for auction houses is the land they sit on, so they have to get that money back. They also have to employ hundreds of people. At a big auction, hundreds of staff come in on sale day to move, inspect and recondition cars. You also have to pay the auctioneer and back office clerical staff because money and titles have to change hands. All those administrative costs are included in the buy and sell fees. That is why there is such a big difference. Selling cars virtually, on your smart phone as ACV, they do not need any land.

They do not need staff to move cars or a reconditioning factory.

### Is it a much higher gross profit margin for online?

We will see some shake out in the online dealer to dealer market, as they are currently not making money.

### Why is that?

They are trying to scale really fast, spending a ton of money on marketing. They are spending money to grow their staff and train their dealers to use these new apps. They incentivize transportation, by offering loss leader deals to incentivize dealers to buy cars on their platforms. How much higher they can make that per transaction fee remains to be seen, but it has to go up because they are not profitable today. What they are trying to do today, is to build scale.

Of course, ACV is spending private equity money and have shown no lack of ability to get new infusions of cash when they need it. Last year, Trade Rev lost money competing with ACV. Cox and Manheim Express have opaque fees as they are private companies, so whether they are profitable or not is anybody's guess as they do not have to report that.

### How are KAR and Manheim shifting moving from physical to online?

I go back to my three tranches of cars analogy. Go as fast as you can with off lease. Those late model, low mileage, high quality cars; sell them digitally all day.

### Put them all on Trade Rev as soon as possible?

As soon as possible. In the middle, is that big tranche of cars that are older, rougher but not too bad and have already been sold several times as a used car. I analyze markets and profit per auction location and am going to right size the physical auction network as time wears on. I push as much as possible to digital. Where I still can make money with a physical presence, I will keep it, but also look at other ways to use that infrastructure. In Atlanta, Manheim had an auction facility near the airport, which was a perfect place to open a mobility center for Uber and Lyft drivers.

They can go there to get their car serviced and can borrow a car to continue driving while their car is being serviced. They can source cars there or rent cars to drive as an Uber or Lyft driver. Manheim turned their Atlanta airport location from a whole car auction into a mobility service center. Brilliant. We will see more of that. ADESA and KAR got out of the salvage business.

### Why?

The short answer was financial engineering. The biggest comparable that Wall Street looks at KAR through the lens of is Copart which, as a salvage online auction, was worth two to three times what KAR, as a whole car and salvage business, was worth. They saw that as an opportunity to unlock value for their shareholders and spun it off as a separate public company and got out of the salvage business.

### Manheim could not really compete either in salvage over the years?

Salvage for Manheim has always been an afterthought. TRA has been a small business at Manheim all along. They were never that focused on the salvage business and run salvage auctions every once in a while.

### Are there any synergies between the two?

We used to preach at KAR that there was a synergy between having the full ecosystem, from off lease to salvage. Regardless of the type of inventory you were trying to sell at wholesale, we had a solution for you. Whether that was an off lease, white labeled solution, on OPENLANE, or a totaled car salvage disaster recovery system, we could sell that car at salvage for you. But they were not getting paid for having that end-to-end ecosystem. Wall Street, for whatever reason, never valued KAR’s stock as an end-to-end service provider, off lease to salvage, as highly as Copart which one could argue are a pure play who are only salvage and only online.

### What makes salvage more profitable or a better business than whole car?

It is a lot easier to manage. For the most part, cars do not move because they are wrecked. You stack them up, bring them in with a forklift and set them on the ground and there they lie. You do not need improved infrastructure to the extent you do at whole car auctions. The ground need not be paved. You do not need a fancy place to have auction lanes run through, nor do you need a cafeteria or fancy waiting lounge.

### It’s a real yard.

Yes, it is a yard and can be out in the middle of nowhere, making the cost structure much lower. The bulk of those cars at IAA are sold online, overseas. They sell cars for parts to buyers in over 100 countries. Buyers are not necessarily coming in to look. They still do, to some extent, and they do sell what they call run and drive cars. Really rough off rental cars are sold at salvage, cars which have been wrecked but still operate.

### But you do not do that in whole car because they are operating cars and have to be driven in the country.

That is not what the buyer base is looking for. The buyer base at a whole car auction is looking for something they can as easily, quickly and profitably as possible, put on their lot and resell, rinse and repeat. The reason KAR got out of the salvage business was really a financial play to unlock the value of that salvage business.

### Is there any risk to Copart?

I do not think so. In this country at least, and in the other parts of the world where both IAA and Copart operate, there is a duopoly with enough business for both of them. Insurance providers are their biggest customers and generally spread out their business among salvage providers. There are only a handful of exclusivity arrangements between Copart and State Farm, GEICO and IAA. For the most part, they share the business between those two entities. They do however compete for the exclusive arrangements which a couple of the insurance providers have.

Commercial accounts at whole car are locked into a contract based on volume and salvage auction providers count on that volume. You are starting to see a differentiation around disaster recovery because, unfortunately, natural disasters are becoming more common. You had five or six named storms in the Gulf of Mexico, this year alone. Three or four of them hit within 150 miles of each other, along the Texas Louisiana Mississippi Gulf Coast. Lots of flooded cars and the insurance providers that do business with Copart and IAA expect those salvage auctions to have their back when they have a bunch of loss in those areas.

### How do you compare the competitive advantage of Copart in salvage and ADESA or Manheim in whole car?

20% of cars sold at IAA or Copart auctions are in that whole car category, that run and drive category. So they are chipping away at the whole car business, but generally speaking, they do not have the reconditioning or inspection infrastructure.

### Is that 20% driven domestically or can they also be driven or taken abroad?

My hunch is it is domestic and a domestic number but I cannot recall off the top of my head. Copart have several businesses; one in Dallas called CrashedToys, where they sell exotic cars which have been dented and the owner said, I no longer want my scratched Lamborghini.

### Is there any reason why they cannot get into the whole car market though?

There is no reason they cannot, but within their business where I see the opportunity would be in that virtual whole car auction. So could a Copart compete, in certain markets, with rough rental cars for an Enterprise or a Hertz? Could they make a bid on more of that off rental fleet business with their virtual platforms? Perhaps.

### That would also compete with Carvana?

Yes; Copart have done very well and their stock is way up this year. Why mess with success, would be the flip side of that coin. You could and maybe in some markets, like a Dallas, where they have tried to chip away at whole car, you might drive some additional business and revenue by opening up your market to more whole cars. ADESA and Manheim are not everywhere. There are probably markets where you could make inroads. Their stock price is way up and they have billions of dollars in their coffers.

You could buy an independent auction and simply M&A your way into the whole car business and as disruption happens in the whole car business, some of your smaller mom and pops independent whole car auctions might struggle. They have been in a family owned situation for generations and it is time to get out of this game because they cannot build infrastructure like a Trade Rev. They are not a technology company like Manheim, who have an entire IT department. Copart could pick up whole car auctions but so could ADESA and Manheim, but they have probably reached a point in their scale where the regulators would look more closely at them purchasing more physical auctions.

ADESA just got away with buying BacklotCars because there is not that restriction in the digital space. I would say there is more M&A opportunity on the digital side but that is not to say that Copart could not pick up some independent whole car auctions. Let’s say they needed land in a market where they were under serving their insurance customers in Texas, Louisiana or Mississippi.

### Returning back to the whole car competitive advantage, clearly the relationships with the commercial side and sellers, the services and reconditioning you provide them but more importantly the buyer network and providing scale and profitability is crucial for them. How do you see that evolving?

Scale and relationships are advantages. In spite of the fact that they charge the most, Manheim and ADESA have the trust of their buyer and seller networks. The guys and gals running used car dealerships have been doing business with Manheim, ADESA or both for years, so they know the drill. They know the auction general manager, the assistant general manager and the auctioneers. They trust them. They know they can source the inventory they need from the auctions they frequent, so it is a no-brainer. Perhaps they will try some startups for cars around the edge. Why not; what have they got to lose?

Generally, I think big auction houses have those handful of advantages. Where they have risk is if these dealer to dealer upstarts, like ACV, gain traction and become profitable by not charging too much. Then some dealers will say, love you ADESA, love you Manheim, love the physical auction experience that you run but you are just too expensive. You have to come back on your fees. I think that is the big risk. Advantages are in the size, scale, trust and all the services you get from ADESA or Manheim. Disadvantages are the cost of maintaining that infrastructure.

There is a right sizing that has to occur and a rationalization around the types of inventory coming to your auction. Push the newer off lease cars online as fast as you can. KAR got out of the salvage business. Manheim has to figure that out. That tranche in the middle, that two to five year old car which has been sold at wholesale several times, rougher or with higher mileage, I have to right size my business around that inventory.

### Joe, this has been great – thank you very much.
