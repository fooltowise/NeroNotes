Behavioral economics states that we are suffer in many cases from [[Why we behave illogically| irrationality]] and cognitive biases.

Many of the supposed biases which economists wish to correct may not be biases at all - they may simply arise from the fact that a decision which seems irrational when viewed through an ensemble perspective, is rational when viewed through a time-series perspective, which is how real life is actually lived.

Life is usually [[Ergodicity|non-ergodic]]!


Nearly all pricing models assume that ten people paying for something once is the same as one person paying  for something ten times, but this is not the case!  Ten people who each order ten things every year from amazon will probably not begrudge paying a few dollars for delivery each time, while one person who buys 100 things from Amazon every year is going to look at his annual expenditure on shipping and decide "Time to rediscover Walmart".

**In real life, 10x1 is not the same as 1x10. You can trick ten people once, but you cannot trick one person 10 times.** This is why con-men tend to base themselves in cities, on racecourses and in other places that offer a reliable supply of gullible victims.
