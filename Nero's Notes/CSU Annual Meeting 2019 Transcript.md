# [[CSU]] Annual Meeting 2019 Transcript

### Constellation Software Inc. - Shareholder/Analyst Call

#### 02/05/19

Mark Leonard

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning. We will do the formal part of meeting first. Mark Dennison is going to handle that, and then we will introduce the panel and probably get the directors to stand up, if I can spot them so that you will be able to target them afterwards. We may get the employee shareholders to stand up as well, but all of that good stuff comes after Mr. Dennison does his stuff. Mark?

Mark Dennison

Thanks, Mark. Good morning. My name is Mark Dennison. I'm the General Counsel and the Corporate Security for Constellation Software. Mark Leonard has asked me to act as the Chairman of the Annual and Special Meeting this morning. Jamal Baksh will act as the Secretary of the Meeting. I ask Paul Allen and Jamie Bajzik of Computershare to act as our scrutineers. Following the formal part of this meeting, we'll be pleased to answer any questions you may have. As indicated in our press release dated February 28, shareholders had the opportunity to submit questions to the company in advance of today's meeting. We have organized the questions received and we will be responding to them after the formal part of the meeting.

The Secretary of the Meeting has filed with me proof of mailing of the Notice of the Meeting, along with the Management Information Circular and the form of proxy. The consolidated financial statements of the company for the year ended December 31, 2018, and the auditor's report there on have also been mailed to all shareholders of the company who have requested them. Additional copies of these materials are available here today and we would be pleased to deal with any questions concerning the financial statements subsequent to the completion of the formal business of this meeting. The Secretary will now read the scrutineer's report on attendance of the meeting.

Jamal Baksh

There being at least 2 shareholders present in person and holding and representing by proxy at least 15% of the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting, I hereby declare that a quorum is present for the conduct of business.

Mark Dennison

This meeting is properly constituted for the transaction of business.

Voting on all matters will be conducted by a show of hands other than with respect to the election of directors, which will be conducted by ballot. Please note that each shareholder or a proxy holder present in person at this meeting has the right to demand that a ballot be conducted on any resolution either before the show of hands, vote or following that vote.

The first item of business is the election of the directors. There are 10 directors to be elected at this meeting. The Management Information Circular mailed to shareholders contains information about the 10 directors. The nominees are Jeff Bender, Lawrence Cunningham, Meredith Hayes, Robert Kittel, Mark Leonard, Paul McFeeters, Mark Miller, Lori Oâ€™Neill, Steve Scotchmer, Robin Van Poelje. The meeting is open for nominations for the election of directors for the ensuing year or until their successors are elected or appointed. I call on Jamal Baksh, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bernard Anzarouth, our Chief Investment Officer to nominate and second the nomination of the directors for the coming year.

Jamal Baksh

I nominate each of the persons whose name appears in the Management Information Circular under the heading Election of Directors to be a director of the company until the close of the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders or until their successors are appointed.

Bernard Anzarouth

I second the nominations.

Mark Dennison

Thank you, Jamal and Bernie. If there are no further nominations, I declare the nominations closed. I note that as described more fully in the Management Information Circular, the company adopted a majority director election policy in May of 2009. This policy enables shareholders to vote separately for each director nominee at a meeting of shareholders where directors are to be elected. If the director nominee does not receive the support of majority of the votes cast at the meeting of shareholders, that director will be expected to tender his or her resignation from the Board following such meeting. The resignation will be effective upon acceptance by the Board and will be disclosed via press release. For more information about our majority director election policy, please see Page 13 of the Management Information Circular.

I'm advised by our scrutineers that not all shareholders or proxy holders in attendance at today's meeting have completed ballots in respect of the election of directors. And so in respect of this resolution, we will proceed by a way of ballot. All shareholders and proxy holders should have been given a ballot at registration, but any shareholder or a proxy holder who may require a ballot, please now identify yourselves to the scrutineer.

Each shareholder or a proxy holder voting by ballot should record their vote in respect of the resolution by marking across next to the names of the nominees for whom they wish to vote. Only persons nominated are eligible for election. You may now vote for more than 10 nominees. Each shareholder or a proxy holder voting by ballot to then sign his or her name on the ballot. I also ask each shareholder or a proxy holder voting by ballot to print his or her name on the ballot. The scrutineer will collect all ballots and tabulate the results. While they are doing so, we will proceed with the next item on the agenda, which is the appointment of auditors of the company and the establishment of their remuneration for the current year.

I now call on Jamal Baksh and Bernie Anzarouth to move and second the resolution appointing the auditors for the current year and authorizing the directors to fix their remuneration

Jamal Baksh

I move that KPMG LLP chartered accountants are appointed auditors of the company to hold office until the close of the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders or until their successors are appointed, as such remuneration is maybe fixed by the directors and that directors are authorized to fix such remuneration.

Bernard Anzarouth

I second the motion.

Mark Dennison

I now put the motion to the meeting. Is there any discussion on this motion? All in favor, please signify by raising your right hand.

\[Voting\]

Mark Dennison

Any contrary?

\[Voting\]

Mark Dennison

The motion is carried.

The next item of business is the consideration of the special resolution of the company authorizing the filing of an amendment to the company's articles to increase the maximum number of directors from 10 to 15. A full text of the special resolution to authorize the amendment to the company's articles is included as Schedule A to the Management Information Circular mailed to shareholders in connection with this meeting. The resolution must be approved by at least 2/3 of the votes cast by the holders of common shares present or represented by proxy at this meeting. Unless there are any objections, I will dispense with the reading of the special resolution and seek a motion from the floor.

I now call on Jamal Baksh and Bernie Anzarouth to move and second the approval of the special resolution.

Jamal Baksh

I move that the special resolution of the company set out in schedule A to the Management Information Circular relating to this meeting be authorized and approved as a special resolution of the shareholders of the company.

Bernard Anzarouth

I second the motion.

Mark Dennison

I now put the motion to the meeting. Is there any discussion on the motion?

\[Voting\]

Mark Dennison

Any contrary?

\[Voting\]

Mark Dennison

The motion is carried. The next item of business is an advisory resolution to endorse the company's approach to Executive compensation as further setout in the Management Information Circular. As the vote is advisory only, it will not be binding on the company. However, the compensation nominating and Human Resources Committee of the Board will take into account the results when considering future Executive compensation arrangements. I now call on Jamal Baksh and Bernie Anzarouth to move and second the approval of the advisory resolution

Jamal Baksh

I move that it'd be resolved on an advisory basis and not to diminish the role and responsibilities of the Board of Directors of the company that the approach to Executive compensation disclosed in the Management Information Circular is accepted.

Bernard Anzarouth

I second the motion.

Mark Dennison

I now put the motion to the meeting. Is there any discussion on this motion? All in favor, please signify by raising your right hand.

\[Voting\]

Mark Dennison

Any contrary?

\[Voting\]

Mark Dennison

The motion is carried. I understand that the scrutineers should now have the tabulation of the votes cast in respect of the election of the directors, and so ask them to provide me with the scrutineers report. One moment, please.

Mark Leonard

Maybe, while we're waiting for the scrutineer, I notice there some people at the back. There are some seats at the front and then there's also the front deck upstairs, which you can access, I believe just at the right at the back.

Mark Dennison

The resolution to elect the directors has been duly carried by the required number of votes cast at this meeting and accordingly I declare such resolution carried. Is there any further business to bring before the meeting?

Can I have a motion to conclude the meeting?

Jamal Baksh

I move that the meeting be terminated.

Bernard Anzarouth

I second the motion.

Mark Dennison

All those in favor, please signify by raising your right hand.

\[Voting\]

Mark Dennison

Any contrary?

\[Voting\]

Mark Dennison

I declare the resolution carried and the meeting terminated. Thank you.

Mark Leonard

So we pride ourselves on being a data-driven company, and I think Mark has improved since last year, but maybe we could have an object measure from the audience in the form of applause for Mark's handling of the formal meeting. I'll remember that and I'll measure it again next year.

First of all, I'd like to take the opportunity to introduce the panel. We'll start at the far left and as they also introduce themselves, if you could just talk about how long you've been with Constellation? What you do for us? And why it's such a great place to work?

Robin van Poelje

Good morning, everybody. My name is Robin van Poelje. I joined CSI as of 1st of January 2014, built with the kind of mini CSI in the Netherlands. We like to branch out now in different other European countries. And I think why CSI is such a great company is we're disciplined investors on one hand and on the other hand, I think we are decentralized around businesses. We are in control of executing our strategies. And I think that each day it's fun. It's nice to see the development of the company, but it's also very important to go each day to your work, get energized and excited. And I do that now for 5 years under the wings of CSI and has been a very pleasant experience so far.

Dexter Salna

My name is Dexter, Dexter Salna and I have been with Constellation for 24 years. I was with the initial acquisition of Constellation, it was called \[ B Software \] and I worked with a fellow over here for 2 years prior to that Mark Miller. And so I run a company called or a division called the Perseus Group. We are focused on home building, finance and leasing, dealership management, manufacturing execution system, dialysis systems and real estate.

Barry Symons

Hi, everyone. My name is Barry Symons, and I'm the CEO of the Jonas Operating Group. I've been around Constellation for about 23 years now. And I guess not to copy what some of these guys have said, but I would say another thing that makes it a great place to work is the opportunities created for people to build a great career. I go back to when I joined, I was a financial analyst working for Mark Leonard doing whatever he needed me to do, which was pretty much anything. And in fact my first job was to set up payroll and I never knew what the heck I was doing there. So figured that one out. But from there, I've grown to do a number of different jobs throughout the organization to where I've been in the Jonas role for about 11 years now.

Jeff Bender

Jeff Bender. I'm responsible for the Harris Operating Group. I joined Constellation or Harris in 1999. So I'm in my 20th year with the group, always with the Harris Operating Group. And I think my favorite part of working with Constellation is really that every day is not the same as the day before. So every day there is something. Some new opportunity or some new challenge that I get to work on and I love that.

Mark Miller

Hello. I'm Mark Miller. I founded a company called Trapeze. I was a co-founder of the company called Trapeze back in 1998 and we were the first acquisition Constellation did in 1995. And so I have been around since then. And what I really enjoy -- -- oversee the Volaris Operating Group and I really enjoy constantly learning. It's just perpetually learning more and able to learn across the world as well as to do businesses with different vertical markets in different countries. So it's what I enjoy the most working at Constellation.

Bernard Anzarouth

I'm Bernie Anzarouth. I'm Chief Investment Officer for the company. I oversee M&A for the group. I joined constellation in 1995 when it was still a business plan. I met Mark and we hit it off. There will be the business plan I said giddy up, and I actually started working in August '95, the week that we acquired Trapeze, our first acquisition. The reason I love working here is get to work with a good bunch of guys that are disciplined and very rational. I get a lot of good things done.

John Billowits

My name is John. Although I've had the longest to think about why I like to work here, I still need a bit of time, but I'm the CEO of Vela. It's the newest operating group, I guess. I have been with the company since 2003, so 16 years. And I guess 2 things I like. One is every year I like sitting beside Bernie and making fun of him as he does a formal part of the meeting, it's quite entertaining. And -- but secondly, what I really enjoy is the people that we get to work with. Obviously, with our growth, we have the opportunity to bring in hundreds of people every year through acquisition and through recruiting and it's really rewarding to watch their careers evolve over a number of years.

Jamal Baksh

Jamal Baksh, CFO. I've been with the company 16 years as well. John actually brought me in back in 2003. Yes, great company to work, great culture, great environment, great people.

Mark Leonard

What I like best about the job was handing off Investor Relations to Jamal.

Mark Leonard

At this stage, I'd like to ask the directors to stand up and make themselves targets for the audience. Yes, there's one brave soul, a couple of others over there, another one over here. So feel free to approach the -- and Paul over there, these brave souls after the meeting, ask them tough questions. I'm sure they'd be delighted to squeal about our weaknesses and strengths. We also sometimes get questions about employees attending the meeting. I'm never sure if it's because they think they're skiving off and not working or if we're trying to sort of trim the meeting to make us look good because we've got a bunch of people in attendance. But to me, it's the ultimate expression of shareholder democracy. It's being an owner as well as an employee. You're investing your lives and your capital in the business. And so I'd like to ask those employees who are in the audience to stand up, most of whom will be shareholders. And if we could have a round of applause.

Mark Leonard

At this juncture, we're going to step into questions and we have traditionally fielded them from the audience. I don't hear that well so I didn't get half the questions, but I used to answer them anyway. At this stage, we requested the questions be sent in and I deputized Larry to help us out and figure out how to curate those questions, and sort of get them into themes. And we have a couple of other people on the panel who I've known for a number of years who I think bring unique perspectives to it. Larry, are you going to introduce the panel?

Lawrence Cunningham

Thanks, Mark, and welcome to everyone. It's an honor to serve on this Board of Directors and a particular treat to serve today as your ambassador to pose questions to the panel, and I'm delighted to be joined by 2 shareholders of the company who know it very well, Jon Salinas and Sanjiv Kalevar. Sanjiv worked at Constellation in the Jonas group for 5 or 6 years before going off to business school and then for some reason going out to Silicon Valley where he is a principal with Battery Ventures. You may know, it's a global venture capital firm in cloud SaaS space, and he remains a Constellation shareholder. Jon Salinas has been a Constellation shareholder since 2013. He is a principal of Hound Capital and the Chief Operating Officer there -- hound Partners, one of the Tiger funds. He's a graduate of Columbia Business School and has served as an adjunct Professor at Columbia since 2011.

As you know, as has been said by Mark Dennison and Mark Leonard, Constellation this year asked shareholders to submit questions in advance of the meeting. Thanks to a little bit of tree shaking from Jamal, some 2 dozen shareholders submitted clusters of questions about 75 different clusters, 225 questions altogether. The questions cover the waterfront, just about every topic, imaginable and cognizable for the group, was posed, most of them are or nearly all of them in expected categories, many of them overlapping. And so our job was pretty easy to organize the questions by topic, consolidate them, condense them and then lay out a plan to cover them.

We can't promise that we are going to ask every single question, but certainly every single topic will be addressed in substance. The inspiration for this approach wasn't only Mark's humility about hearing, but rather experience and observation of a lot of Annual General Meetings over many, many years. It's common for programs like that to leave questions unanswered, give undue weight to idiosyncratic questions. And so we think it might be more efficient, more productive to take this approach of gathering questions in advance. As some of you may know, I'm a student of Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffett. I have also studied annual meetings and done some research around it and he discovered this point about 10 years ago, up until then virtual meeting was simply an open Q&A with shareholder mics and he discovered it would be much more efficient in terms of everyone's time and coverage to instead enlist a panel of 3 who curated questions in advance and pose them. And so that's part of the inspiration. But as with the Berkshire meeting, here today we'll also supplement this gathering with your question from those microphones. We'll have some -- we'll allocate some time for that, right, about the midway point of our questions and answer and at the end. Most of the questions that we received were targeted to either Mark Leonard or Bernie or to any of the operating group managers who wanted to weigh in and we have generally followed that approach. In a few cases, shareholders address their a very particular question to a particular operating group manager. And while we did not share the details of any of the questions with them, except those that were addressed to particular managers, in particular, and we'll have a segment dedicated to that in the beginning of the second half. So in terms of content, we've clustered the questions into 6 or 7 categories. The first will be on acquisitions, current environment, hurdle rates, prospects. The second will be on capital -- capital allocation. The third on the share purchase and disposition agreements. Mark Leonard and Mark Miller announced a month or 2 ago, we've been having some discussion on software industry dynamics, including the cloud and SaaS and then into operations, personnel and succession planning.

Well, that's the basic order, or the basic framework. I'll start the questions and then we'll take turns up here. The first category is acquisitions. And first question, as with most, we invite any of the operating group managers to comment, but I think, also for a global view, Bernie's perspective will be particularly useful. And here's the question. What are the most important things you've learned in the past few years from Constellation scaling up it's M&A activity? And in particular, has competition gotten tougher or easier? And what do you see the trends going forward?

Bernard Anzarouth

Sure. Thanks, Larry. I don't think the environment has changed very much over the years other than it's getting more and more difficult to make acquisitions. There's a lot of competition. I guess I gave you the same message last year. At the very high end, we've got private equity firms that are bidding up prices and it's been quite difficult for us to compete with them. As you go lower and lower, you've got the platform acquisitions of these PE firms also bidding up prices for the lower end of the market. At the same time, we got copycats coming and looking at our track record and they've seen what we've been doing and they've seen our successful run and they're trying to bid-up those businesses as well. Having said that, we still have managed to close our fair share of acquisitions and this is on a global basis. We've been doing that by increasing the number of feet on the street, frankly, I mean, it is a sales job, we're actually trying to find a home for these software businesses to go live for the long term. The one thing that we do provide amongst other things is a permanent home for these software businesses. For a lot of these people that are running the small VMSs, they really care about their people. They care about their customers. They don't want them to be given off to 1 group and then 5 year, 5 to 7 years later sold off to a different group. And so I think they find some good advantages of selling out to us. And what we have been able to do is with the people coming on board, again across the operating groups, is that they've been able to understand the importance of what we have to offer and they've been able to sell that quite well. So we have been able to keep up with what our targets are in terms of making these acquisitions. And so now it's just a question of figuring out where our return on investment is for the increase in personnel in M&A. And we're monitoring that on a regular basis and we still want to continue to strive to improve our coverage of the transactions that are made on a global basis. And I think that is happening because we are monitoring it and we're finding our niches in terms of finding good acquisitions, good solid people to bring onboard and good solid businesses as well.

Lawrence Cunningham

Thank you, Bernie. Any of the members want to add or subtract?

Unknown Executive

Yes, I'll add. It's a -- we talk about the Board meeting yesterday, I said it's sort of a journey, right? And as we've sort of scaled up our M&A efforts over time, you experiment, you try different things to see how well they work. And one of the things that you always have to keep grounded in doing this is remembering that when you're talking to an owner-operator for business, and you're trying to explain to them that we are a buy-and-hold acquirer. We really care about your business long-term, your people and your customers, what have you. That conversation is best had by one of our senior people who's been with us for a while. So you can't necessarily throw people at the problem, you need to have the right conversation with that owner-operator and it needs to be with the right person inside of our businesses. And that is really probably our biggest bottleneck for doing this, I'd say, would be having those quality conversations with, with our people and the owner-operator. And that's one of the things that you sort of hope that you wouldn't have to worry about but you really do and that's one of the things we continue to try to make sure that our people are spending time doing it.

Lawrence Cunningham

Well, next question was CSI's latest annual report indicates it is serving approximately 110 different vertical markets and the questioner asks whether that number can rise. In other words, is the number of verticals increasing globally as software proliferates?

Mark Leonard

We approved a new one yesterday.

Unknown Executive

But we can't talk about it yet.

Lawrence Cunningham

Are there verticals that any of your groups would like to be in, but are not in yet?

Unknown Executive

We get asked that question quite a bit, and I think the way we've always thought about it is, once upon a time, we thought, let's find the ideal vertical, let's chase it like crazy. Then what we realized is we really can't force people to sell unless we want to write a really, really big check and we try and avoid writing those really, really, big check. So what I think, we've learned is we've got to do it more from making sure we're in contact with people in all the verticals there many as humanly as possible and be there at the right time when it's ready for them. And so as much as there are verticals we admire and want to get into one day. I don't think we can necessarily make it happen. We've just got to cover the vertical well from an M&A perspective and when the right opportunity comes up, be there and be ready to offer a fair price for that business.

Lawrence Cunningham

Robin?

Robin van Poelje

Yes. I also think there are certain verticals we're already in, but we're not in specific country, we're not in to give you an example, whereas \[indiscernible\] are quite strong municipality in the Netherlands. And we entered 2 years ago, in France. And you can't compare the same verticals with characteristics of these countries are different. So yes, we would love to enter in the same vertical, but then new countries as well.

Lawrence Cunningham

There is a reference to coverage segues into the next question, which is what portion of the universe of VMS acquisition possibilities does CSI learn about, conduct due diligence on, bid on and win? Anyone want to comment on the coverage frontier?

Bernard Anzarouth

Yes. We are not going to give out the actual coverage.

John Billowits

It's poor and it's getting better.

Bernard Anzarouth

Yes, that's all that we could say.

Unknown Executive

Not high enough.

Bernard Anzarouth

They're not high enough. We still complain that we're not seeing all the transactions that are out there, but it is getting better on a quarterly basis. We do monitor the transactions that are taking place. And of course, there's always something that you have to remember. A lot of the companies that are actually being acquired by private equity firms, we'll have a second kick at the can 5 to 7 years down the road. So a lot of these businesses do get recycled and come back out and hopefully we'll have a better chance to acquire them when they do come out. But yes, we do have coverage issue. There are a lot more transactions that are taking place on a global basis that were actually not in the game. And with our increase in number of M&A professionals and people that we recruit and senior executives as well that are actually working within our operating groups will be able to increase that coverage

Lawrence Cunningham

Well I guess you in some ways anticipated the follow-up question, I mean, when you move from poor to better, John, what are the levers? How do you do that? Bernie suggest part of it is staffing. Does it vary by geography? And how important in the end is coverage to capital deployment?

John Billowits

I guess I'll start since I was the one who said poor. I think it's a follow-on to what Robin alluded to. Our coverage outside of North America in most geographies is still pretty weak. We're obviously very strong in Holland. We're very strong in Australia. But as we're finding, let's call them platform acquisitions in each country, we're uncovering dozens and dozens of potential follow-on acquisitions. And the advantage of having your first one in that country is significant as compared to one of us or one of the many people in the room flying over and visiting those prospects. So every time we enter a new country, which last year, my guess is we probably entered 15 new countries, it takes years to build up those relationships with those local companies. So it doesn't happen immediately, but it does give us a sense that over the next 5 or 10 years, we're quite optimistic that the growth can continue, but probably it's going to be a lot, there will be more and more outside of North America.

Bernard Anzarouth

At the same time every time we look at a new business in a new vertical, it adds to the number of prospects that we're looking for. I mean, they -- I mean we try to understand as much as possible the competitive environment in every new vertical that we go into and it opens up a whole new world of businesses that sometimes we just weren't aware of. At the same time, we have a lot of people that are scouring Internet, the world, directories, looking for new business leads. So businesses that are out there that we didn't know about and we're still fortunately adding lots of businesses to our database. So there's a whole world out there and companies continue to be created on a regular basis. We go to conferences, such as SaaStr in California and in Europe and we just find these new businesses that are just starting now. And some of them might be a bit too small for us to acquire at this juncture, but it's 3, 5 years from now they could be a good a size and good target for us. We're still uncovering lots.

Lawrence Cunningham

Final question in this segment on competition. This question focuses on internal competition. How do you handle as all of the groups are out scouring the world or at least North America, how do you handle conflicts or competition among the CSI groups?

Bernard Anzarouth

Sure. I guess, we can take this...

Lawrence Cunningham

Hey Bernie, let the guys take it.

Lawrence Cunningham

They're competing with each other.

Unknown Executive

I'll start. So I think, Mark used the word journey before, so I think, it's fair to say that as we're all looking to increase our coverage and increase our capital deployment, I think it is a journey that we're on to figure out the best ways to do that in the best way for shareholders. And I think there's -- sometimes there's great successes and other times they provide us some great learnings as to how to do it. So I think our system right now we have a combination of specific rules that we put in place for people to follow and then we have, I'd say a more informal process of conversations at our level up here to make sure that we think we're doing the right thing for the businesses like make sure that they're enduring and for Constellation, our shareholders. So I'd say it's sort of a combination of formal rules and informal discussions to make sure that things are going on. But there's no question, it's a journey and there is definitely challenges along that journey.

Lawrence Cunningham

Hang on this. Let's get some more controversy. Another view. What does it like competing with sister companies? What does it create? What is it -- what are the advantages and disadvantages?

Unknown Executive

Well, it creates a lot of tension for sure because as things fall through the cracks and one of the other, let's say, business development professionals, one of our businesses doesn't realize that this particular company is already being covered by one of the other companies and it creates a conflict and that happens and there was a lot of tension around that obviously, right? But it's -- the good news about it is, is that you'd rather have this, the tension in the system than having so many rules and it being so clear what everybody should do that you actually miss things, especially when we have an overall coverage issue where we don't feel we're covering enough already. So despite there being conflict and tension between sometimes a few levels inside of our organization, I think we're okay with it because we're trying harder to get -- improve our coverage and we'd rather overcover and have duplication in some cases than undercover and miss stuff, so.

Mark Leonard

I think one of the essences of management is balancing opposing forces that you face. And in this particular instance, we've set the companies against each other, divisions against each other fighting for as much turf as possible trying to acquire as many companies as possible, and we have a series of rules around that, but they're not supposed to violate. But whenever you get close to the edge of rules, you start getting violations and that tends to draw out emotion. When you've hired a bunch of highly competitive people, they tend to really get emotional about it. When I feel good about it is when things sort of bubble up to the operating group managers and I get to see altruism all the time at that level. So for instance, Mark's got the largest M&A group inside of Constellation. In every quarter, and not because he is on a reporting schedule or anything, every quarter Volaris seems to contribute a deck of what they've learned and what they're thinking about and what they're seeing, which the other guys get to learn from. And it's not like everyone isn't on a learning curve as well, but Volaris shares what they've learned. And that obviously if they're competing with each other is not behavior that makes any sense at all, it's altruism. And I think that sort of willingness to grudgingly do what's right in your mind even though it hurts you is the sign of great managers. It very rarely happens.

Unknown Executive

It helps that we're all big shareholders.

Mark Leonard

It does but the compensation, the wealth, there is a level at which you get to where it doesn't matter anymore and it's more about doing a great job and trying to win. And I think, particularly as you get older, there's this desire to share and even though it's with internal competitors you share and it's remarkable to watch. It's painful as they said, it's a journey and we're learning and I wish we could do it better and I wish we were more efficient, but it's really cool.

Lawrence Cunningham

Well, I'll hand the baton to Jon, who is going to ask some questions around acquisition leverage and hurdle rates.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Good morning, everyone. First off, I want to thank Mark, Larry, the entire board for inviting me to participate today. Greatly appreciate it. So as Larry mentioned, the first question, talk a little bit about the use of debt in acquisitions and how everyone thinks about that, principally going to address this to Mark, but curious any thoughts Bernie or anyone else may have. So starting off, utilizing debt as a component of financing acquisitions can obviously boost the equity IRR and make CSI more competitive in bidding for acquisitions. Can you discuss the potential at the moment to apply limited amounts of debt in future acquisitions? And related to that, does this criteria vary few based on the size of the deal?

Mark Leonard

So John teaches at Columbia, and so let's use John as a foil. I think first of all, you got to think about where you use debt so let's start at the parent company, Jon. How much do you think we could borrow? Like really stretching it, gun to the head covenants, leg breakers, the real go for the gusto?

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

I'm going to defer to what you think is the right answer there.

Mark Leonard

So let's say that we could borrow, I don't know 7 or 8x EBITDA, something in that range, round about...

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Seems reasonable to me.

Unknown Executive

Right. Then Jamal?

Mark Leonard

$7 billion, there you go. So we're going go out and we're going to borrow $7 billion and we've got this gun to our head with covenants. And although notionally it's long-term money so they can charge us more for it. And it's going to hurt our bottom line, let's say, phew, I don't know, 10% cost on this stuff is expensive. And so there's sort of 3 quarters of bottom line has gone. Okay. What are we going to do with it? John, what are the uses of capital?

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Well, I would say you have a few different options. You could acquire businesses, you could repurchase your stock, invest internally.

Mark Leonard

You got to talk about special dividends, I just did.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Special dividends, yes.

Mark Leonard

So, let's say, we repurchase stock $7 billion and we're using U.S. dollars. So let's call it 20. Let's say, we buy back 1/3 of the shares, so there's now 2/3 of the shares outstanding and we have decimated the bottom line by roughly 2/3. So it doesn't feel like shareholders got ahead in that transaction, does it? No. In fact, they probably halved their sort of free cash flow per share. So we're not going borrow the money and buy back shares at current prices. So the alternative is we can pay out a big special dividend, and so everyone gets to party. The guys here, they look around and they probably don't need anything really. So they probably are going to go invest the capital. Do you want to distract them with that? Do you want them each looking for some investments on the side when they could be investing in Constellation's capital? That's probably not a good idea either. So then you could go buy companies. And have we shown any ability to bang out $7 billion in our entire history at high rates of return? Not really. We've invested maybe $2.5 billion, $3 billion over our entire history, that's 20-something years. So that's not a good use of capital either, plus we generate a fair amount of capital every year. So the idea of leveraging up at the parent, although in finance terms it may be brilliant, it doesn't seem practical to me.

So then leveraging up further down, as you know, we've been doing some ring-fenced transactions where put in some equity and go borrow a ton of this nasty looking debt, done a bad debt. And the banks right now in the financial institutions and lenders of various kinds are very, very aggressive. We are looking at one of the lowest prevailing rates, interest rate environments that we've seen in, God it's going to be 20-something years, maybe 30. Since we went public, I think, the prevailing government rates have dropped by half in the last 13 years. So you can borrow lots of money in these stand-alone things and that puts you on par with the private equity firms in terms of what they're doing to buy these companies. Now rumor has it the private equity firms generate very high rates of return on the equity they've put into these companies and so we would like to do the same. And so emulating them so that we can be on par and we can compete for such transactions sounds inherently appealing. And it doesn't undermined our discipline of maintaining relatively high hurdle rates. So that was something we've tried. We've done actually 3 now, 2 biggish ones and a little one of these larger leveraged transactions. It means you don't invest as much money, but you do invest it at high rates of return and we can all send the excess cash back to you guys and let you invest it. So that kind of works for us. It maintains the discipline. And when we have literally hundreds of people working that discipline, it becomes pretty scary to try and change what we do. So when we pursue hundreds of acquisitions, we'd like people to approach them with similar methodologies and we'd like to measure them against each other, and so we very rarely change the hurdle rates. We make minor adjustments from time to time for very specific groups of targets.

So yes, we use debt. We use it on a ring-fenced basis because you have to match the weapons of your enemy, but not because we think it's inherently attractive. If I were looking for attracted debt at the parent company, what I'd really look for is something that looks as much like equity as possible. So interest that can be deferred, no covenants, very long term. And as you know, we've created that instrument and we have used it. We used it when we did the TSS acquisition to take out bridge financing, which is a very scary piece of paper that we had at the time we did the acquisition. It's worked out great, Robin's done a wonderful job and paid down the debt that we used at the level of TSS and has paid some dividends and that's helped us pay down the debt that we incurred with the purchase of TSS. And then subsequently of course, we did the financing with the debentures. So that, I think, addresses the debt questions.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Great.

Unknown Executive

There was a hurdle in there somewhere, wasn't there?

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Yes. Let me elaborate on the hurdle rate question a little bit. So I saw a press release last night announcing that the Board has authorized reducing the hurdle rate for acquisitions above $100 million, I believe. Can you elaborate on that decision related to hurdle rates and the impact you think it will have on the business overall?

Mark Leonard

I'd sort of hoped you'd have hit the bar by then missed the press release. So as we look at the supply of acquisitions, you have to make some assumptions about what's available to you at various levels of pricing. It's like any market. And when we looked at the large acquisitions and our market share it was terrible. We'd only done a couple in 6 years. And clearly, we were losing on price a bunch of the time. And even if we had competitive advantage in knowing the vendors having had relationships with them for years before the assets came on the market, many of them had been in sectors where we were already competitors and knew the market space very effectively, we were still losing. We were unable to use those advantages sufficiently to win a reasonable number. So the choice was between continuing to walk away on nearly all of those transactions or to try and win a small share of them by being much more price competitive. And I made the case that we could add value that we could acquire businesses at hurdle rates that were lower than we had used elsewhere inside of our portfolio, but which would still add value to shareholders. And John, what does finance theory say about cost of capital and incremental deployed capital?

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

That if you think you'll earn above the cost of capital it's beneficial to shareholders.

Mark Leonard

Exactly. So you go all the way down to 8.1% if you've got an 8% cost of capital and you're adding value to shareholders, except what we found was that if I drop the hurdle to get an incremental acquisition, we end up dropping the hurdle to get all of our acquisitions. We call it hurdle rates are magnetic. And what we've perceived over time is that whenever we've dropped the hurdle, nearly all of our transactions have drifted down to that level at the time that we actually do the transactions. And so if you do follow finance theory and take it all the way down to the cost of capital, I think you destroy all of your value added. And so we're really careful about dropping the hurdle. And this was a big decision. It was an about-face as one of the directors called it for me on dropping the hurdle for large transactions. The reason I'm going to do it for large transactions is it's going to be a very small number of transactions, it's an experiment. We're going to learn a bunch and it doesn't affect the bulk of what we do in terms of activity. It's going to chew up time from people on the panel here. It's going to hopefully be a dozen transactions that we end up chasing over the course of the year, but what will end up happening is we will hopefully win 1 or 2 of those, we'll see. And we're hoping that the brokerage community who handles nearly all of these transactions will be more than happy to invite us in for these pursuits. So it's -- give me a year or 2 and I'll tell you how it's going.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Thank you. Anything and anyone else on the panel would like to add on the topic?

Robin van Poelje

Well, I worked in the beginning with TSS also with leverage and we had good experience with it and where we had less good experience with it, we drew our lessons. And I think our type of business with mission critical business with recurring revenues, I think if it's the right quality, I think, you can put leverage on it, so that's one. And 2, it's not only the height of the debt, it's also the way you structure it. So, I think, that's where Mark was referring to is covenants. You can structure it these days very in effective ways. So your business needs to go really South to get into trouble. And if you buy the right quality, I think it's worthwhile considering in a ring-fence setup.

Lawrence Cunningham

Well, to round out the section on acquisitions, Sanjiv has a few questions about international and the horizon.

Sanjiv Kalevar

Yes. Thank you, Larry. So yes, this next section will be addressed to the operating group managers. So feel free to chime in. The first question will be on actually the deals -- the companies you don't acquire so in avoidance. In evaluating potential new lines of business or further investment in existing lines, appealing characteristics probably include a fragmented market, good cash flow and constrained or mature competition. To the extent you've passed on potential new businesses or verticals or further investment in existing ones, what were the factors?

Unknown Executive

I'll...

Lawrence Cunningham

They're competing. You see them competing.

Unknown Executive

It's always more desirable to stay in something that you know. And so what we try to do is our -- the operating managers that report to me, they try to go in and look for their competitors. They know their verticals. They can speak to them intelligently. And so each of my operating groups, they expand their businesses by talking to the competitors and going to trade shows and that's how we invest in our own verticals. And then stepping outside of your current vertical, there's always a risk, it's always something that you don't know. And so we're trying to mitigate those risks by involving consultants when we go into new vertical, talking to other experts and trying to reduce that risk as we get into new verticals. Once we get into a new vertical, then you're more familiar, it's easier to go and acquire competitors and tuck-ins since you have the management team and an infrastructure that you can build on.

Sanjiv Kalevar

Thank you.

Dexter Salna

I can add to it a little bit. One of the things we've seen in a few of our verticals is what I would call a rational competition where people are in the business not to make money but to capture eyeballs or bookings or whatever the case may be. So in situations where it looks like the competitive landscape is in the business not necessarily to make money but more just to capture eyeballs, that's something that we've tried to shy away from and have shied away from a couple of times. So that's a little bit something unique.

Mark Miller

And just one comment on other verticals, like one of the challenges you have if you're just working in one vertical as you can get diminishing returns in that vertical by overinvesting in sales and marketing or R&D and continuing to try to grow your business outside of maybe what the size it should be. And you might actually think that you're acquiring a competitor for strategic reasons and those -- so you can also run into that challenge as well, whereas you are able to invest in other verticals or move to a new vertical, it might be a better place to allocate capital than in your own vertical. So I think that's an important point and one of the opportunities you have as a good capital allocator to make those decisions inside of Constellation.

Sanjiv Kalevar

Okay. Great. Thank you. And you touched a little bit on familiarity, and so this next question kind of broaches that, particularly international. So can you provide any color on plans to expand acquisition activities in new countries? And in particular, what criteria do you use to evaluate these new geographies?

Unknown Executive

I feel like I'm closest \[ energy \] if it's unfair, keep looking at me at the start. Yes, so we've expanded dramatically geographically many of our groups over the last 3 or 4 years. And I think we, as Mark said, we're very data driven. So when we initially went into these markets they were all small bets, first of all, so we're going in small to try to learn. And what we found and we've got enough data to support is that our returns are in no way different in any market we've gone into relative to the markets we're already in. So we think we're doing a good job at analyzing the peculiarities of those countries and finding companies to buy and then using those companies to buy further companies down the road. And at the end of the day, we're coming at a conclusion that a VMS is just as attractive no matter where it is in the world. I mean, obviously some markets are markets that we're being very careful with, but definitely in the Western world many of the characteristics -- we like about VMS are the same in any country you walk into in Europe. And we found that the attributes we love here are just to say there and in many cases we're stepping into verticals there that we really can't in North America because the verticals are too big and they're being -- they're owned by private equity owners. And so we're being able to enter into some verticals, particularly in Europe that we've struggled to enter into in North America.

Mark Miller

Yes, I think -- we're in several dozen countries right now, with Volaris. And the interesting thing about deciding to do that is it is hard on your senior capital allocators is they have to hop on planes and fly to these geographies when we're making a decision to actually enter a vertical in a new geography.

And clearly, they also have to be able to adapt to who they're sitting across the table from and dealing with and the culture of that particular company and country, what have you. So it is a big commitment to do it. And after you've managed to get into the country and have -- over time, it doesn't instantaneously happen, it doesn't never instantaneously happen over a period of 4 to 5 years, you're then able to use the people that you acquired for your first acquisition in that country to help you expand and do more acquisitions inside of that geography as well. So there's some interesting challenges, but it's a lot of work, hopping on planes and flying around the world. I mean our senior capital allocators that do international stuff fly 200,000 to 300,000 miles a year to give you a feel for that. It's tough and it's not for everybody. And some leaders who we have that are great capital allocators that are very happy to stay within their own geography. But I say that's maybe the biggest limiting factor until you're established in that geography.

Jeff Bender

I would say from the Harris experience, I think our bar for the quality of the management team is a bit higher in some of the -- certainly, the non-English-speaking geographies because of the cultural and language challenges. I think we spend a little bit more time, not sure if it's a conscious higher bar, but I think if I was to look at what we sort of chose maybe not to pursue, I think we actually have a higher bar because I think some of the things that Mark spoke to, just the challenges of being able to draw people in who know your best practices to be effective I think is a little bit more challenging geographies that have, assuming, a different culture or don't speak English.

Mark Miller

And you really got to be comfortable with market share attrition, some of the basics that more so than you might be locally. You got a feel of that business there to stay and it isn't going to require many, many changes to fix it out.

Sanjiv Kalevar

Great. And so you've mentioned, you've touched on North America and Europe quite a bit in this -- in the prior questions. There is a question around how does the pipeline look in emerging markets. So I'm not sure that you'll -- won't pick on John because he volunteered but any -- maybe any of the other operating managers?

Barry Symons

I can start there. We've looked at a bunch of businesses in India as of one of the "emerging markets." Haven't been able to do a transaction there were a little bit nervous in terms of, much like what Jeff said, really understanding the culture, the geography, the composition stuff like that. So I think we're a little hesitant, and it has to be a slightly better deal or maybe even a significantly better deal than we might find in a geography we're already in. So we've looked at that. We've been exploring a little bit in South America, haven't really found anything yet, but just starting to do a little bit of that. And that's sort of what we're covering from a Jonas perspective on those fronts.

Mark Miller

Yes. I can mention it. Yes, I mean we've done a few deals in South America for the last like 6 months to 1 year, and I have only to go once, but down there, over that period we've had people back. But it's -- yes, it's an interesting market, there's a lot going on down there, right? Brazil is a large country with few hundred million people and a lot of software to run that place. So there's no reason not to be in that market and thinking about that market and -- but again, it requires time and investment or even converting some of our sort of online training stuff to Portuguese to adapt to Brazil, and so it takes time and effort. But yes, I feel it's a place we want to be. And again, if you're -- remember, we're buy-and-hold forever so it's -- there's no reason that, that doesn't apply in these emerging markets as well. And who knows where they'll be in, in a few decades. So I'm glad we're playing in those markets and continuing to learn about them and how to do better.

Mark Leonard

I think it makes it easier if you know a particular vertical in let's say, North America and go down to Brazil, and the case in point that Mark's talking about, one of them was in public transit. You're already in public transit -- 2? Sorry, shows how much I know. And it gives you a sense of familiarity with the products in the sense of the market that gives you some comfort to go ahead because it's almost scary when you're going into this geographies.

Mark Miller

Yes. Important to recognize too, that we're not trying to export products to these markets or import products in these markets too, right? So even if we are in the same market, so I think some people might rethink that that's what the strategy is. So it's not impossible, we might use something but it's not likely.

Mark Leonard

And there are developed markets too, to go after we haven't penetrated. We've made a little bit of progress in Japan. We have our first acquisition there. \[ Peter Alba \] is our newest Japanese employee who's joining us today. And he's going to be a cultural ambassador, back and forth, helping to take our best practices to Japan and, hopefully, help us understand how we can do what we're trying to do in Japan better.

Sanjiv Kalevar

Awesome. Thank you. Last question in this section is just, what are the upper bounds in terms of market share in your existing verticals? And how much additional headroom do you have in the current, kind of, 110 vertical markets where you are today?

Mark Leonard

I remember there was a Jack Welch story. He used to try and get the various business units to identify the market share, and because they wanted to be #1 or #2 in every vertical, the trick, of course, was to define your verticals so that you win #1 or #2. And so you win #1 in every vertical we're in.

Mark Miller

In fact, they measure by latitude and longitude of the customer, right?

Mark Leonard

And it's funny, venture capital's just the opposite. They won these large total available markets, TAMs and -- or total addressable markets, I guess. And of course, they defined their markets as enormously broad as opposed to us who tend to go narrow and say, we're #1.

So it's such a hard question to answer and it's so subjective. The good news is that you get into 1, and if you have a good team and -- but done a great job for their clients, they tend to drift outwards. They get some bigger clients, they get some smaller clients, they get some clients that around the periphery of the vertical, that is they call vertical, and they just sort of spread. And if you look at the story of Trapeze, it's a great one, our first acquisition, having started off with fixed-route scheduling, they're everywhere.

Mark Miller

I think the real -- I mean, the way I try to talk about it, especially we're talking about organic growth and trying to get our businesses to grow, is I like to look at how much they're spending on our stuff versus their overall operating expenses of that customer. It's infinitesimally small, like it can be 0.01%. And I'll say to our team, if we can make that 0.012%, we've grown 20% inside of that particular customer. And thinking about how you can offer value to that customer, help solve the problem that they really care about to get such -- that's important enough that they're willing to pay you that extra little 0.002% is interesting. So that's how I'd prefer to look at it. And it disappoints me when our leaders can't find ideas to just take a little bit more of how -- to help our customers do things better.

Mark Leonard

Well, I noticed we're gathering small people at the back. I think there is a tier of seats upstairs, and there's some stairs over there. So if you get tired at some stage, you're welcome to wander up there and you'll get a much better view of me.

Lawrence Cunningham

Excellent. That completes our first section, we'll now move into the second topical section, which we denominated as capital. And the first cluster of questions is around the keep your capital program that Constellation began experimenting with about a year or 2 ago. And I know that the operating group managers might have different points of view on these questions. So I'll just ask the questions and then let them fight it out. How's it going, is the question. How is keep your capital going in your group? Have there been any positive or negative surprises versus expectations? Or any early read on returns? And finally, what are the greatest operational challenges that you face in your group around keep your capital program? Any of the operating group managers who would like to begin?

Unknown Executive

Right, John.

John Billowits

I think I like Jeff better to start on that.

Unknown Executive

Jeff would be a great responder to that.

Mark Miller

You should start, Jeff.

Jeff Bender

We had a fairly heated conversation yesterday morning around keep your capital. So I think it was John or Mark, who pointed it. It's definitely a journey, it's like anything else. It's a significant change in what we're asking people to do or how we're asking them to think, and I think as you go through any significant change, it's going to be difficult and challenging at times. And I think currently, I would say, within our group we're definitely experiencing some of that challenge. But I think not unexpected, I think the first -- what I'm currently seeing is a significant shift into short-term thinking in terms of trying to get as much capital out because of the consequences of the keep your capital program, which I find disappointing for a company that has a very -- our motto is buy-and-hold forever and be thinking long-term, so I find that frustrating. So I think I'm trying to figure out how do we balance, again, dealing with our poor market coverage and the ability to deploy more capital with making sure we stay in long-term focus. I think that's the question that must be answered. And I think right now, we're trying to figure that out, we shared some ideas, some of us agree, some of us disagree on how that might be. So I think again, it's a journey, we're at the very front end of the journey. And so I think each of us, within our group, is experiencing it differently. And I think depending on, again, where you are and what you're doing, the implications of it are different. So I think the one thing that everybody has to remember is, it's just a program, we started it for a reason, we can stop at any time we want, we can adjust it anytime we want, right? There is no specific reason to continue a program that we think is not in the best long-term interest of the company. So I think with that as the backdrop, we will continue to sort of trying to figure out what the right next step -- next step is. And I think each of us would like we approach it differently because we have different realities.

Robin van Poelje

Right. We did split these 2 years ago in 2 parts. And one part was immediately on KYC and the other wasn't. And the one which was on KYC started growing very fast. Then the big question of course is, do they buy the right stuff for the right returns? So far, our projections and our recent experience seem to indicate that they do.

The other group was lagging a little bit or this year on KYC and they suddenly get a lot of traction on M&A. And also there, the jury is still out because the returns are quite recent but it looks to move in the right direction but I agree with Jeff, it's a journey. There are pluses and minuses to it, and we try to learn from it and tried to tweak the model. So I think it's a quite interesting experiment so far.

Barry Symons

What keep your capital has definitely done, it's helped Constellation focus more on increasing the amount of effort we have on M&A and the higher coverage. And so this is a long-term thing that will happen because you increase your resources and sometimes you don't acquire these companies for 5 or sometimes 10 years. And so the investments we're making today will pay off but not immediately. And so you can't go and put 100 people in M&A and then expect to have 100 times more acquisitions that will be 100 times more acquisitions in 5 years or longer. And so it's just a long-term thing, and we're going through some of the growing pains of competing with each other and finding out how to work together. However, I'd rather go and lose a company to a sister Constellation company than to private equity. And so the competition, it's kind of creating tension but it's also creating more opportunities.

Dexter Salna

I'll add one little bit more to this. One thing I've noticed is it's probably exposed a little bit more of a talent weakness we have within our organization because what ends up happening with KYC is you lean on the people that you trust the most and are closest to you, so your direct reports, and you suck them into the deploying capital problem, and as you suck them out of the day-to-day operations and into deploying capital problem, then what they were doing in the day-to-day operations is no longer getting done. And so that cascading effect has really sort of shown itself within the Jonas organization, which is probably a good thing for us, which means we need to work on backfilling in the organization, some more talent and it's something we're working on.

Lawrence Cunningham

I think that pretty much covers the waterfront on KYC. So I'll pass the baton again back to Jon on return on...

Mark Leonard

Actually, I'd like to do a confession since everyone else is getting the talk about KYC. Keep your capital is what it stands for, and the idea is that you basically own the profits that you make and it's your job to go and reinvest them, ideally, at very high rates of return and that creates significant value for everyone concerned.

So about a quarter ago, we paid an extraordinary dividend compared to anything we've paid in the past. And it was couple of days later that we're sort of contemplating what we've done, and I realized they had a feeling of lightness. I was happy. And as Jeff pointed out to me, I'm a hypocrite. So not having your capital being responsible for your capital, all of it to deploy and having it sitting around in cash, and having to fight the urge to deploy at a little less than our discipline rates of return, that was a weight off my back. And yet it's not a weight that we've taken off our energies back. We're asking them, the operating group managers, to deploy their capital. We're not saying, "Yes, deploy some. Let us know how it goes. We're going to deploy all your capital." So the pressure is on them. I took it off to myself, and boy, I felt relieved. I haven't taken it off them. And so that stress is in the system and it's being absorbed by humans and it's being converted into energy, as invariably, stress does get converted into energy, and some of it's negative energy. And so there's fighting over acquisitions, there's complaints about hurdle rates. It's tough, it's scary, it's unpleasant. And we could make it all puppies and rainbows and send it all back to you and that would be easy. And so obviously, we don't want to do that, we do want to see capital deployed with high rates of return. It's finding a middle ground that works in a way that creates an enduring enterprise that is really good at deploying capital. And that's the fine line we're trying to walk.

Mark Miller

And I think just to a bit of a comment on the market, I mean it's really -- it's been interesting to see because I think 3 years ago or so we looked and we said, "Hey, what is our actual coverage of the number of transactions that are happening out there?" Would it have been 3 years ago-ish, right? And said...

Lawrence Cunningham

It's '15, yes. 2015 we started...

Mark Miller

Yes. 2015. Sorry, guys. So yes. So 3, 4 years ago, we looked at and we said, "Well, I want to really do a great job of this." And we probably should have realized that in 2010 if you have something like that. So I hold us completely responsible for that. We should have actually been all over that. In fact, I'd expect our business leaders at running one of our businesses inside of our verticals to know what their share is and what their coverage is, and if they're not getting it, then someone else is winning that coverage. I'd be asking what's going on there. And so we looked in the mirror and said, we've got a challenge here as...

Mark Leonard

And I remember that Mark blamed it on the Board most recently.

Mark Miller

That was recently. I took some of that accountability there, right? So there, yes, some accountability. But \[ Steve \] reminded me that the Board just asked questions of a management strategy doesn't set -- get strategy so correct \[ Steve \]. So but I think -- so once you realize you've got a problem, you start saying, what can we do to solve this? How do we do better? And we're doing a whole bunch of things. And KYC or keep your capital is one of them as well as expanding our M&A team, what have you. We're trying to solve a problem that if we started a decade ago, we probably have been further ahead now, and it's just a lot of pressure on that and we all feel very accountable for getting a couple out, and we always have. But now I think we've identified the problem. This is just one of the tools we're using to try to help us fix it and as part of that journey.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Thank you. So for the next question submitted, it's a bit of a reflective one. Principally, for Mark but love to hear from anyone else that has a view. CSI has created substantial shareholder value since its IPO to present. What factors do think have most contributed to that shareholder value creation? And from here, what do you think the outlook is for those major factors?

Mark Leonard

So I'm going to use you, Jon, again. So if you take some of the fundamentals, and you look since IPO, whether it be cash flow or revenues or EBITDA or whatever it is that you like, there's sort of March forward bit 20-something percent per annum. And yet the stock price since March forward at 30-something percent per annum, maybe even high 30s, maybe even 40. So how do you explain the difference between those 2? Like you and I, we value investors by training and inclination. How can you get this departure in the marketplace from intrinsic value?

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Sure. This is a lot harder than I thought it would be.

Mark Leonard

We told Jon he was going to ask questions.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

But I had a few moments to prepare and had feeling it would continue. So I would say, part of the explanation, I think, is exogenous to Constellation. I think since the IPO, we've been in a period that seen a substantial decline in interest rates. And as a result, I think we've seen aggregate valuations for public businesses in the market expand overall. In particular, I think over time, you've likely seen the perceived intrinsic value of Constellation increase. Where essentially the multiple on earnings increase because of a few factors. One, I think, in a lower interest rate environment, investors have been willing to pay up for a perceived recurring revenue and cash flow businesses like software. Second, I think Constellation is focused on vertical markets software, there are businesses that have structural barriers to entry and really, a perceived durable competitive advantage. I think there's also been a premium placed on those businesses over the past years as well. Lastly, I think increased confidence and ability for the company and all of the managers to continue to deploy capital at high rates of return. I think over time, as you have a longer series of proof of that ability, that potentially adds to the perceived intrinsic value of the business as well. How did I do?

Mark Leonard

I think I would -- definitely sort of A-, B+ kind of. I sort of planted the drop in government interest rates since we went public earlier in the conversation to see if he would pick up on that. And I think that's certainly have been a big factor, that's been a great tailwind, people just don't expect the rates of return that they expected 13 years ago these days.

Now there's a big question as to whether, of course, we will have 2% government bonds in 10 years' time or 5 years' time or if, in fact, there will be a reversion and interest rates will go up. I don't know how many of you are in a bond portfolio saving for retirement but at 2% and after the government's taken after inflation, it's a pretty depressing scenario. So we're certainly not going to see interest rates drop another 2% over the next decade. I don't think, anyway. Let's go with very unlikely. So where else are we going to get the tailwinds? Or are we going to see what I wrote about probably 5 or 6 ago, which is the Jack Henry situation where we continue to build intrinsic value but the stock price doesn't move? In the case of Jack Henry, it was a decade of stock price not moving yet phenomenal increase in intrinsic value, no matter how you measured it. And so I worry that, that will happen with Constellation. I worry that it will happen with markets in general. If you're a value investor and you think about a margin of safety on your investments these days, it is really scary out there. But if instead, you're driven by financial models, it's very easy to take a company like Constellation where I wrote that I would hope that the company can generate 10% to 12% increases in intrinsic value over long periods of time, looking forward, which would be half what we've done looking back. And if you then discount that at cost of capital, the stock of course is worth an infinite amount because you're growing faster than your discount rate. And it's only priced at $1,200 a share, it's going to be infinite, guys. And of course, finance theory says that you can't grow at 12% per annum forever because you become bigger than the GNP of the world. And so I recognize that there will be a time where we don't grow at those kind of rates. There's a lot of companies out there and we're reasonably good at what we do. And so looking forward to 5 or so years, I can feel pretty good about that kind of growth rate. A lot of it will be acquired, some of it will be organic, who's certainly always trying to work on organic as well. I've lost the thread Jon, bring me back.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

So I think you addressed some of the go-forward factors. Related to that, I think you've spoken pretty consistently for the past few years, if not for all of the years, about the challenges to continue to generate high ROIC while continuing to grow the amount of capital deployed, yet even through 2018, you've been successful in growing capital deployed quite a bit while maintaining a high ROI. What do you think is allowed for that sustained high rate in terms of both growing the amount of capital deployed and the ROI?

Mark Leonard

This is one of those term paper questions from Columbia. So really, it's a question about moats and many of you here moat aficionados. And the moat around our businesses is different than the moat around our acquisition engine. The moat around our businesses, as you would expect, it's the stickiness of the software, it's relatively limited number of competitors in each one of the verticals, it's a intimate knowledge of their needs and being able to deliver to those highly targeted verticals, very customized solutions, which is the opposite of the sort of thing that you hear in a lot of software companies where it's economies of scale and being a low cost provider, and then eventually, once you've driven everyone else into bankruptcy, gradually jacking up the prices, which appears to have been $1 trillion trick.

And so those moats, I feel pretty comfortable about -- we haven't seen a lot of instances where those moats have been crossed effectively and where economic value has been destroyed in the portfolio companies. The moat around the acquisition engine, the ability to buy lots of small medium-sized companies with attractive rates and return on the deployed capital is a lot harder to define. And as I tried to think it through and figure out how to make it deeper and harder for people to cross, what I discovered was a lot of it was know-how and learning curve. And the problem with those things is that they travel in the years of employees. And so employees can leave and they can take a lot of that with you. And so what you have to do is sort of race up that learning curve as fast as you can and constantly improving. So the constant incremental improvement of M&A for small and medium-sized businesses is our competitive advantage. It's one that will eventually erode because our improvements will get less and less, but the good news is, that we're s\*\*\* at it right now, and so we can improve a lot over the course of the next little while. And so it's still a barrier to follow us. However, what it means is you don't advertise every new revelation you have about how you do M&A, which is why we decided to clampdown on talking about it and sharing data. And so the curtain of silence descended, we don't even talk about the number of acquisitions we do anymore, we wish the analysts would stop talking about the number of acquisitions we do. And we'll keep doing what we've been doing, and we think that we'll be able to continue to deploy capital, but it's going to be hard. It's going -- what the -- there are going to be followers in the barriers to entry are nowhere near as big as they are in our intrinsic businesses, which are the foundation of what we do.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Great. Now final question for me on this section reverts back to keep your capital. It's much more specific, a bit less meta than the other questions. And the submission asks, are you seeing the range of ROIC across the operating groups narrow due to keep your capital?

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

You can feel free to take a stab or if anyone else...

Mark Leonard

Yes, definitely. There's a Kurt Vonnegut short story, which I love, about the handicapper general. The handicapper general goes around and finds beautiful people, make some wear masks. Finds graceful people, makes them carry weights because everyone should be equal. And so what we do is we take our most profitable businesses and make them keep their capital so that everyone can be equal. What tends to happen is that you're forced to put out capital, the rates of return we used to generate in the old days, if you have very high returns on invested capital, now, tend to get dragged down by the fact that we're now investing capital at lower rates of return. And so yes, there's a narrowing of the returns on invested capital that we're seeing across operating groups. I am the handicapper general.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Any other perspectives on that topic?

Mark Leonard

You got Kurt Vonnegut, what more could you ask for?

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Sanjiv, I'll hand it off to you.

Sanjiv Kalevar

Sounds good. All right. Mark, we're going to keep you on the hot seat here for a minute, but of course, welcome to -- welcome for other opinions as well. But Mark, can you describe if and how the Board of CSI has challenged you to deploy capital in non-VMS market?

Mark Leonard

And so we talked about it a year and a bit ago, and then we paid the dividend, special dividend just over a quarter ago. And Robin piped up and said, "Well, I sort of feel that it's your responsibility to go find other places to put this money, and that's not impossible." And I had been sort of focused on the vertical market software stuff, and I thought a little bit about the other stuff that we might do. And so I haven't done a very good job, and Robin pointed out that was entirely within my capabilities to go out and hire some people to help me with this. And so I took the helm and I didn't, but I did hire a kid to go do some research for me. And so we've been looking for other companies that have been able to find multiple platforms around which to do significant numbers of acquisitions because we think that's stuff that we would be good at. And we found a few, and the difference between companies that succeed in one vertical and just rolling up or buying up in one vertical, and those that do it in multiples, is something I don't yet understand. But I suspect, from what I've seen so far, that it's just they run out of space and the little vertical that they chose as their first one and they end up going to a second and a third, et cetera. And so I'm trying to study them and figure out what other people have done and how they might have blown their brains out, and how we can avoid doing that, the brains blowing out part, ourselves, as we start to look around for other things to go do other than vertical market software. And newspaper thing that I wrote about sounded kind of cool, maybe we can do that.

Sanjiv Kalevar

Cool. And are there any additional kind of organizational challenges in deploying capital beyond -- once you figure out?

Mark Leonard

Yes, it's the old circle of competence argument. And I think many of you, as investors, those of you who are professional investors, you end up developing this sort of circle of competence. Very few of you will say the S&P 500 is my circle of competence, maybe that Larry Fink guy. But those of you who actually try to pick stocks tend to end up picking stocks often in an area that you become familiar with because you can very quickly get to the bottom of what looks like value. And I think we will end up doing the same thing as we look around for places to deploy capital. We'll develop a circle of competence. And when we study the high-performance conglomerates historically, what we discovered was they had a methodology. It wasn't just buying asset-light businesses, and eventually applying gobs of debt and leverage to the party and dropping hurdle rates. There was more to their success and their enormous growth. It was also the ability to figure out some secret sauce. It was said their [[Danaher]] Business System, it was Six Sigma in the case of some of them, it was 80/20 in the case of ITW. It was an operating methodology that enabled you to buy less than ideal companies and make them much, much better in your area of expertise and, obviously, that's something we'd like to do. And it probably means that we won't go buy a tiny little company in a new area. We're -- probably we'll buy something that's more platform like and has some demonstrated ability to add value to the little companies that advise.

Sanjiv Kalevar

Thank you. And then back to Larry.

Lawrence Cunningham

Excellent. Thank you so much. We finished topic 2 on various aspects of capital. We now go to topic 3, the automatic share purchase and disposition agreements, ASPDs that Mark Leonard and Mark Miller entered into month or 2 ago, generated a considerable number of questions, mostly for those two in particular but then some broader ones for the rest of the group managers on the implications. So those specifically to Mark, and Mark, first, can you describe the methodology you used to arrive at the purchase price of $800 per share and the sale price of $1,000 per share?

Mark Leonard

Yes. So I took a growth rate and I discounted it back at the cost of capital, it came to infinity. And then I use the margin of safety from infinity down to the price that I set as the sale price. It was quite a good margin of safety. Actually an infinite margin of safety. And when can you get an infinite margin of safety, it's so rare these days, you know?

Lawrence Cunningham

My guess is the people who ask the question wouldn't feel entirely satisfied by that.

Mark Leonard

So there may have been an element of signaling in what I did. May have been.

Lawrence Cunningham

Do think the signal was received?

Mark Leonard

About as well as the signal was received when we basically said, we can't invest this $500 million here, you take it back. That signal wasn't received the way I expected either.

Lawrence Cunningham

I want to pre-empt...

Mark Miller

I joined in the signaling as well.

Lawrence Cunningham

Well, then here's the natural follow-up. I understand that the arrangement you both entered into has an expiration date. I forgot what it is, coming soon. Do you intend to renew it for another quarter? Same rates or how are you thinking about the future of signaling?

Mark Leonard

Well, in my case, if I do renew it, I can do it for the next 80-something years before I use up my shares so it's possible. I think I'll be 142 when I ran out of shares. And then my kids can start selling shares, so they probably get to be 200-something before we're done.

Mark Miller

Currently not. I think I'm going to...

Lawrence Cunningham

Jon will ask some of the tougher questions around implications of the program.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

So I think you partially addressed this but just to be more specific at questions submitted as to whether or not the ASPD reduces alignment with CSI shareholders. What's your perspective on that?

Mark Leonard

The ASPD or the forcing of employees to invest shares and bonus in the first...

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

The first question relates to the ASPD.

Mark Leonard

Alignment. So if I'm selling, and people are buying, no. I would say, no.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Related to the topic you brought up, the impact on employees, specifically ASPD also requirement that employees invest their bonus. Curious, what impact do you think that has on employee perspective and mentality?

Mark Leonard

I don't think the employees feels good about buying shares today as they did back when the shares were $18 a share. I think a lot are worried that they may be overvalued. I think a lot of that is the exogenous matter that you talked about, which is that the market is probably overvalued. And that there may be a reversion to the mean on valuations, generally. And of course, no one wants that. If we, however, knew how to time markets, we wouldn't be working for Constellation, we'd all be rich. And so my temptation is to say, trust us, on average we'll get it right over the next 20 years. It may be expensive today, it may be cheap a year from now. On average, I think we'll create value and I think we'll do better than average. But yes, I wish it was cheaper and that you were buying shares cheaper.

Mark Miller

And that's very much the same thing I would say when I get asked about it internally, right? So that same message, right? And we're in for the long run and that's -- it's really a time horizon thing. So if you're in for the long run, yes, we believe we can do better.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Great. Lastly, on this topic for me. I think Constellation has been very thoughtful about employee alignment, incentives, stock ownership, other forms of compensation. Are there any new compensation plans or schemes or incentives that you've been considering? If so, comfortable sharing any of that?

Mark Leonard

So we actually had this discussion yesterday, with the Board. I was showing them how bonuses as a portion of earnings before interest, tax amortization, bonus had gone down over time. And there's a whole slew of questions that popped out of that. And particularly, if the company is performing and we are deploying capital and generating extraordinary rates of return, are we sharing that value creation appropriately with the people who are contributing to it? And the general sense I got from the Board, and it wasn't that I was looking for a resolution or anything, the general sense I got from the Board was there's headroom. If you guys want to propose something, if you want to come to us with something that's a long-term incentive program above and beyond what we currently got that you think will make Constellation a better place to be for those employees to develop those skills, and then propose it to us. And so that's sort of the challenge I've kicked back to the General Manager. It's this let's think about this, let's sort of try and be creative. Let's come up with something that makes sense and shares the wealth.

Sanjiv Kalevar

Thanks. All right. So...

Mark Leonard

That wasn't planned, by the way, just -- we had that conversation yesterday.

Sanjiv Kalevar

So we'll give -- this will be -- the next set of questions will be for the operating group managers. So the question is, are other CSI operating managers and employees allowed to participate in a similar ASPD? And how many are interested?

Mark Miller

I think the first answer is pretty easy. Everyone can do an ASPD if they really want to. And I don't think there's any restrictions on any shareholder doing it. The second one, I can speak for myself, I can't speak for everyone else up here. But for myself, I currently have no interest in entering a plan of any sorts in the near future.

Lawrence Cunningham

Anyone else want to...

Sanjiv Kalevar

Anyone else want to chime in?

Mark Leonard

And neither do I.

Sanjiv Kalevar

Other than the occasional fur coat? Other than I.

Mark Leonard

Yes. I love that venture capital \[indiscernible\] liquidity. It's so '60s and '70s.

Sanjiv Kalevar

All right.

Lawrence Cunningham

Excellent. Okay. Well, that concludes the third segment. We now switch to SaaS or the cloud. And I'm particularly grateful to have Sanjiv on the panel because this is an area of his deep expertise. And so he will lead the discussions in this section along with Jon. Thanks.

Sanjiv Kalevar

Thanks. Thanks, Larry. All right. Again, open mic for any of the operating managers. So a lot of software vendors have realized a lot of value or attempted by attempting to transition their clients to hosted solutions and kind of increased their recurring revenue. Is this a material and high-priority item or opportunity for CSI? Why or why not?

Robin van Poelje

Well, I think the characteristics of SaaS or cloud, whatever you call it, I mean, the words are also not always properly used. But what we see is that some of our customers like to be unburdened. So they no longer want to have big IT departments. They no longer want to have certain investments in hardware and all these kinds of considerations. So in some of our verticals over time, we already developed in that direction. For example, in our general practitioners business or in our pharmacy business in the Netherlands, we do this already for more than 10 years. Why? Because general practitioners simply doesn't have an IT department. So we took that over from them. There was a clear demand, people were willing to pay it and we did it.

So if we do take a look at, for example, our mortgage business in the Netherlands with big clients, sometimes they don't care, sometimes they care because there is a new CTO coming up and ask for it sometimes, we don't know why. So it depends per segment, we do it, sometimes in a clear opportunity. And we can service our clients. So when the demand is there and we can do that in an economic way, we will do. But you have to consider that we, most of the time, work in relatively small markets so the economic unit cost argument, which we see in more horizontal software, doesn't always apply in our markets, I would say. But we have good experience within TSS, so...

Sanjiv Kalevar

Got it. Thank you. Any other probably general managers who want to chime in there?

Jeff Bender

Yes. So I've asked each of our businesses to have a strategy for moving to -- I just think with SaaS as really being just a choice of how you choose to sell or license your software. It's going to be more cloud where the software is not residing at the customer site, to have a strategy for that and to present and talk to myself and the other senior leaders about what their strategy is, update us, talk to us about what's happening in the market, what they're seeing, what the competition is doing, what the customers are asking for. And I think -- so I wouldn't say it's a critical imperative in the majority of our business. It is more for others. But again -- so I'd say, it's just part of our daily dialogue. So I don't see it as this sort of a cliff that's going to just all of a sudden happen. I think it's part of how we talk about our businesses in the markets that we're in and the competition that we're facing on a regular basis.

And I think for a lot of our legacy businesses, I've been quite pleased about their ability to get to the cloud actually quite reasonably, although some might say inelegantly. But the offer is there. And for existing customers, it's actually quite acceptable. And I think our new development tends to always be sort of I'd say cloud first or cloud centric anyway. The last 3 acquisitions we did were all 100% cloud-based companies, right? So I think you even see it now in how we're deploying capital. We're actually purchasing SaaS, cloud-based company, right, we're not always purchasing older, legacy technologies. So I would just say it's just part of one of the things we talk about every time we get together.

Sanjiv Kalevar

And when you talk about you've presented your business unit managers to make those kind of recommendations to you, there is a difference between the cloud as a technology and then the cloud as a pricing kind of mechanism. Which one are you kind of focused on?

Jeff Bender

Both. I would say both, yes, for sure. I mean the pricing one to me is easy, you can change your pricing anytime. We can price our solutions however we want to. The technical one is definitely, I'd say, the more challenging one in terms of -- depending on what your legacy technology is. Getting it to actually be in the cloud can be definitely a longer journey for sure.

Sanjiv Kalevar

Thanks. Anyone else?

Bernard Anzarouth

Yes. I think just Jeff covered it really well that we have hundreds of businesses. And each of those businesses has a leader, and we coach them on best practices. And in some cases, they decide to follow them. And this is depending on their market situation, who their competitors are, what's happening in their market, they might choose to do that faster than others would. So it isn't like there's a centralized corporate group of people who are saying you need to do this. You really do. And you need to do this by this date or else. It's really a decentralized decision, and it needs to be that way.

Sanjiv Kalevar

Okay. No, that makes sense. And so that is a good point and leads into the next question, which is around, does -- the decentralized nature of decision-making at CSI, does that limit the ability to make SaaS transitions?

Jeff Bender

I mean I don't think so. I think -- so if you went back maybe 5 years or 10 years, and you went to one of our best-practice sessions or summits, I don't think there would be a lot of conversation about SaaS and cloud. We've been talking about SaaS and pricing and people sharing with their peers what they're doing, why they're doing it, what's working, what's not working. And now the discussion of how do you get to cloud is again a core part of the agendas and the stories that we share with our people. So I would just say, whereas it wasn't on the agenda 10 years ago, now I would say, it's a core part of the agenda where we just keeping putting up business after business saying, "Look, this was their challenge, this was how they solved it," "This was their challenge, this was how they solved it," and sort of bringing them together but no differently than we would have talked about maintenance pricing or professional services utilization, it's just another discussion at our overall best practice sharing.

Sanjiv Kalevar

Thank you. So getting deeper into the infrastructure side of things. Not hopefully to get too deep, but the question is are you using -- for the SaaS products, are you using the kind of the hyperscale cloud vendors, right, so Google, Amazon, et cetera, or other products in CSI? And what best practices are you using across the organization to avoid vendor lock-in and ensure efficient use of resources across of these various providers?

Robin van Poelje

Maybe I can kick off. I think we're the only one with our own data center. And so we have 50, I don't know, 57 business units now. We have 1 unit who has its own data center. They're more or less kind of center of excellence within the group. But if they want to use third-party suppliers, it's fine with me, it's not mandatory. We had our earnings out of the way. And what we found out is by having it in-house, people feel more comfortable switching over because it's one of your colleagues, so it makes it easier. There's a certain psychological level of comfort. And I think we're really moving to the public cloud that's not in the business of where we're a hosted story today. For example, our health care data needs to be stored in the Netherlands. And they like to do that with a trusted party, and we're one of them. So lots of clients like to have it with us. We have our own data center. But some of our business units go to other data centers in -- or providers in the Netherlands. And we have not a central policy for this. It's again like Mark said, per business unit, they can decide what's best for their business.

Dexter Salna

I just want to add, it's always hard to establish some sort of rules if you're doing multiple acquisitions every year. So every single acquisition we make, they've got a cloud solution or some sort of hosting solution, it's somewhere else. And that's not the most important thing in our businesses of where we host, our most important things in our businesses is retaining customers, retaining employees. And giving a good return to shareholders and having a central cloud strategy isn't on the forefront.

Mark Leonard

Yes, I do share the concern though about hypercloud lock-in. I thought the cloud vendors were nuts -- they were spending gobs of capital building huge facilities, and it seemed to me that they were creating undifferentiated utilities. And I guess I wasn't very smart. What started to happen, of course, is that they provide you with all these wonderful free tools to help you build your solutions. And of course, your developers, the guy making the decision, you're not really focused on it and you only have to sign up for 30 days so there's no lock-in there. And so of course, they code in all the wonderful tools that Amazon and Google give them. And then they have these other wonderful tools for provisioning after you've got clients onto the system. And pretty soon, you realize that you may not have written in a proprietary language but, boy, you've got proprietary infrastructure. And peeling it off of one and moving it to another of the hyperscale cloud is impossible and you're basically in lock-in with very sticky vendors who are smart and have AI engines to figure out how much they can gouge you for.

Bernard Anzarouth

I think just one final thing. So as shareholders, 2 things you'd be concerned about: a, that we're not moving fast enough and that we're leaving some money on the table that we could be providing our customers value to get at, let's say; and the other one would be that in our high-churn businesses where we lose a lot of customers every year, that a new entrant can very quickly move in with a cloud solution if we don't have one. So just sort of a step back. Those are the 2 things, if I were you, I'd be worried about and thinking about.

Sanjiv Kalevar

Yes. And very relevant segue, so next question is for the operating group managers again and sharing color on what they're seeing in their particular verticals from kind of the newer entrants that are kind of SaaS or cloud vendors. There are specific -- a couple of specific examples that we referenced in the questions but specifically in structure, taking share and then also private software company called Mark43 in the public safety space. So the question will apply more broadly, but we'll touch on those 2 as well.

Jeff Bender

I can talk about Mark43. Again, an impressive company. I spoke actually to the leaders of our Public Safety business. I think we're not seeing them very often where we tend to compete, they tend to be competing at the higher end of the market, the sort of the Tier 1, Tier 2 maybe Tier 3. Where we typically would compete -- our Public Safety business is more Tier 4, Tier 5. Again, their strategy is to do the enterprise from QA to dispatch to the records management systems to the jail. They started with CAD. They definitely have made some progress with some customers on CAD. They don't really have a record system, and they currently are not even talking about their jail system.

So I think at the end of the day, I think it's good when these companies come into the market because I think it can wake up some of us who maybe are not as sharp as we need to be. But I think the true verticals, and I would say that public safety utilities, local government, these are very slow-moving markets. And I think -- to me, it's a great wake-up call, and there's lots of things that we can now be doing over time to be able to, I think, understand what they're doing and sort of adapt our solutions to be able to offer something reasonably comparable, right? So actually in our Public Safety business, our RMS is already only available online. We only sell a cloud-based RMS solution. We're getting there with our CAD.

So I think at the end of the day, I think -- will they be another competitor? I think they will. Will they take some share? Yes, they will. But I don't see it as a massive disruptor to the entire market. Definitely a very impressive group of investors behind Mark43, including Jeff Bezos. But I think, again, they've made some traction but, again, typically not playing in the markets that we're playing in. I think in a more broader sense, I think most new entrants into any of our markets are cloud-based. I mean so you're not really seeing anybody come into any market that is not offering some sort of cloud-based solution. And I think Mark43, I think, is a good example of someone who's going at the enterprise. A lot of people would typically go at maybe a business process or a piece within the enterprise to get a foothold and then potentially try and leverage their solution to create an enterprise solution. So I'd say, most of what I would be seeing in our markets are people going after specific pieces of the enterprise with a cloud-based solution not the whole enterprise itself. It's a much more daunting task?

Sanjiv Kalevar

And what are other folks seeing maybe in some not as \[ steady \] industries that's kind of selling into governments and maybe more private sector?

Mark Leonard

What about the salon and spa?

Barry Symons

Sure. I think that fits under the Jonas realm. Yes, we see a lot of cloud entrants in our fitness business and our salon and spa business. And I think what we see is they're coming in -- and this is the point I raised a bit earlier with irrational competitors who are chasing not necessarily profits but market share. And so their strategy a lot of times is to come in super, super cheap and not worry about making money and returns on invested capital because they can raise capital pretty efficiently in today's market. And so our challenge is to make sure that we're being rational as we think about competing with them and finding ways to win without blowing your brains out and burning through a lot of cash. But it's definitely happening a lot in the fitness space and the salon and spa space pretty much worldwide.

Sanjiv Kalevar

Anyone else? Sounds good. With that, we'll hand it back over to Jon.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

So for me, one additional question submitted with regard to the impact of SaaS on competitive dynamics by vertical. I'm curious to hear from some of the OGMs that have not yet addressed this. In verticals where you see fast-growing SaaS competitors, have you seen any -- or do you anticipate any impact on customer retention or win rates?

Mark Leonard

It's a self-answering question, right? If you see them growing quickly, they're probably either winning new names or taking shares, so yes. Obviously, we don't see that many verticals that we're already in where we're losing share fast. And it should be painfully obvious, if we are and if our managers don't spot it and respond, that would be a tragedy.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Larry, I'll hand it off to you.

Lawrence Cunningham

Excellent. Well, thank you very much, everyone, for your patience as we collated the questions that you had submitted. We now like to entertain questions from the floor for a segment. And as you begin to think about what those questions might be, remember what we've covered. We've covered acquisitions, capital. We've covered the purchase and sale agreements, and now SaaS and the cloud. So -- and in terms of the segments that we will cover after this opportunity for -- to hear your specific questions, we'll cover some operations, personnel and succession planning. So we want to create this opportunity to ask questions, really any cognizable topic but having -- do regard to the things we have covered and that we intend to continue with. And if you would, identify yourself before you ask your question, and if you're asking it to a particular member of the panel, to say their name as well. Yes, sir?

Unknown Attendee

My name is \[ Barack \]. I'm from Montreal. My question is regarding the hurdle rate decrease that was announced last night and you gave a lot of great color on it. I just had, frankly, a very simple question, though, regarding that. Can you give us an idea of the order of magnitude of the decrease? So that would be my first question. And the second one, just to confirm that for anything under $100 million, nothing has changed basically? So those are my 2 questions.

Lawrence Cunningham

Bernie, would you like to field that or...

Bernard Anzarouth

I think Mark will...

Lawrence Cunningham

We could delegate that to Mark.

Mark Leonard

So we think it is going to be big enough to move the needle on capital deployment. And that's a judgment call that we made looking at the size of the market and where we have pretty good data on the size of the market for these large transactions. We're well aware of what transacts. They tend to be well publicized. And we think we know the kind of rates of return that the competitors generate. And so with that, you can hopefully triangulate -- we can hopefully triangulate what we need to do to win, and so we have. And the nice thing is it's an experiment and it runs for a year or 2, and we'll see what happens fairly quickly. We literally think there will be the chance to take a run at 50 to 60 of these things over the course of the next year, and we'll win some or we won't.

Unknown Attendee

Got it. So nothing changed?

Mark Leonard

And yes. No, we haven't touched the hurdle rates below that. We do the similar sort of exercise of trying to assess how much we could deploy at various hurdle rates for small- and medium-sized transactions. And we look to the curve, and you can justify dropping the hurdle rates slightly in the small- and medium-sized transactions. If you think you can handle the volume of transactions you would get, but the cost of dropping the hurdle rate is enormous if you believe in our theory that hurdle rates are magnetic, and so you get this offsetting effect of you spend a lot more to find the acquisitions because it doesn't scale up well. It's sort of in lockstep. And you've got to digest them, and you give up the incremental margin on the ones that you now buy for higher prices. And so we decided to not touch the hurdle rates on the smaller transactions because action costs become very significant on the small ones, and I think that's one of the reasons why a lot of the private equity guys can't chase them. Firing up the limo and getting out the G5 just chews into your margin.

Lawrence Cunningham

Thank you, \[ Barrack \], for the question. Microphone 2.

Unknown Attendee

Sure. My name is \[ John Ewing \]. I was wondering, Mark, if you could summarize your current thinking on the debentures and the role that they play and how the pros and cons of the special dividend versus retiring debentures or -- and whether investment-grade debt might make more sense now than it might have at the time they were issued. So general thinking on the debentures roughly.

Mark Leonard

I mean Jamal has done an investigation of investment-grade debt recently, has a sense of how much we could raise or what kind of prices. Do you want to share with people, or not so much?

Jamal Baksh

I mean the mark is the mark. I mean everybody knows that we could raise a lot of debt at lower rates. It's the attractiveness of the debentures is why we decided not to repurchase them. Mark mentioned earlier, no covenants, PIK. I doubt I could get great rates for a PIK interest for 25 years. So that's why we had left them as a potential source of capital in the future.

Lawrence Cunningham

Yes. \[ John \], is that -- anybody else want?

Mark Leonard

\[ Mr. Ewing \], do you have a follow-on question? No.

Lawrence Cunningham

Okay.

Mark Leonard

Okay. Nailed it.

Lawrence Cunningham

Thank you, \[ John \]. Microphone 1 again.

Unknown Shareholder

My name is \[ Pada Levin \]. I'm a private investor, and I was wondering if you could talk about the incadea acquisition, the one where you recorded the purchase gain, I think right on the one where you plan a $20 million EBITDA loss, right? I was hoping to hear about your game plan and why you think it was a good idea as kind of a showcase of how Constellation Software turns around businesses that are not doing so well that they're acquiring.

Mark Leonard

So that's speculation. I've seen nowhere where it says that incadea was a bargain purchase nor needed turning around. But if we had bought a business that needed a turnaround, we would be very enthusiastic about turning it around and look forward to it and have one of our best people working on it.

Mark Miller

And just traveling a lot.

Mark Leonard

Should that person exist?

Lawrence Cunningham

Let's go back over to microphone 2.

Unknown Attendee

Good morning. My name is \[ Brian Peary \] from \[ Reed Street \], and I'd love to hear from a few of the different business unit managers about the degree to which you engage in best practice sharing amongst yourselves and perhaps whether there would be more appetite for that in the future. I don't believe there has been any sort of pushdown of best practices from the corporate office, but then as a follow-up to Mark, I would just be curious to hear if there would be any appetite for that ever in the future.

Mark Miller

Yes. I think -- so it happens, I would say, pretty much like as a regular occurrence. So as an example, we had all of -- Harris had all of our leaders, everybody who runs a business, so it was like 50 people there. I think we had all of our portfolio managers. I think it was like maybe 75 people in total at a meeting. And John came down and spoke to that group for a couple of hours, as did Bernie, again, John sharing again his specific strategies as to what he's done with Vela for capital deployment, how he thinks about it, how he measures it, what he's trying to do with it. Bernie, again, was writing some guides on best practices sharing across Constellation acquisitions to our group. I'm heading to one of Robin's groups in about a month to do some sharing on, again, using Yonder, which is one of the outsourced groups that Robin has in terms of how, as a customer, we feel about using their services. And they also asked me to speak about HR best practices, in terms of those types of things. So I think those are 2 examples in the last 3 months that happened, and I think -- I saw Barry's agenda for his offsite, it's got people from...

Barry Symons

And Mark Miller is coming to mine in a couple of months, so yes.

Mark Miller

And I think it's happening.

John Billowits

I'd say it's extensive, and it's getting more over the years. Not only us hosting our own best practice sharings on various topics, but we always now include many people from groups, not only to come and speak, but also to participate as well. So we just had 100 people in Toronto this week, and Robin sent over some of his team to sit in and participate and then Daniel Zinman, sitting right there beside you, presented some of the best practices from Perseus. So it's happening everywhere.

Mark Leonard

Except the head office, they don't invite us anymore.

Lawrence Cunningham

\[ Brian \], that's a great question. It was also submitted and it was on our list. So you've covered some of the next section. I appreciate that. Yes, sir? Back to microphone 2.

Unknown Attendee

\[ Clayton Saks \] from New York. Somewhat related to that question actually. Just wondering if there's been an increasing focus on integrated payments across the business units and if they're sharing across the business units on that topic.

Barry Symons

Yes. I'll take that. I think I have amongst the most in payments. We have tried to do some things more across all the different operating groups. It's a bit of a struggle because of our decentralized nature. So we're more focused on just working on integrated payments within the Jonas business units. And so we have a business unit we call Constellation Payments, which works pretty much exclusively in the Jonas Operating Group, helping with integrated payments in a number of our different verticals. It does work a little bit with the Harris Group. And I don't think we work within the other CSI group currently. But yes, we started off with the thought we could go sort of corporate-wide, but it's difficult because of the decentralized nature, so we're really focusing more on just the Jonas groups.

Mark Leonard

The nice thing about payments is it's another source of income that you can get from the same client base. It also tends to slightly diminish attrition. So there are some synergies to doing both payments and software. I think the other way around is much more attractive, so a lot of the payments companies like to buy software companies because they can hang onto those payments clients and roll them into their infrastructure. And so we've seen a fair amount of competition from payments companies buying up software businesses that we would have liked to have owned.

Lawrence Cunningham

Well, thanks, \[ Clayton \]. Seeing one more question there from the mic, and then we'll come back to the panel.

Unknown Shareholder

Mr. Mark, first of all, I want to congratulate you that your price -- stock price has gone up 1,200 -- over 1,200. Secondly, I'm a shareholder since 2013. And I remember the first meeting, I came here, 2013, was only about 40, 50 people in a law office somewhere. So that's very, very good. And also, I'd like to ask you a question, why is there no woman on the Board? Is that because they're doing so well?

Mark Leonard

So there is a woman on the Board. Lori is -- has been with us now for a year or so and has -- was a partner at one of the accounting firms, one of the major accounting firms, had a particular interest in technology and had served on a number of other boards. We are searching for new directors. As you know, we've increased the size of the Board and we've, hence, created some new spaces. And we are trying, first and foremost, to find directors who are highly qualified and secondly, who would provide greater diversity. And so I approached 2 in the course of the last quarter. And I had talked about this a little bit before. When you find people who are really good fits with the criteria you have for directors, they tend to have other things in their lives. And so you have to put on a campaign and try and sell them on the idea of being a director. And one in particular got quite a ways with and she had an ideal background from my perspective and had a very long runway. She was quite young. And when push came to shove, although she felt the experience would have been terrific and very relevant to her career and her life, she felt that the commitment, and we really expect significant commitment from our directors in terms of time and energy and focus, was too great and that she couldn't and wouldn't do it. So of course, I've embarked on a campaign of wining and dining her over the course of the next decade, and maybe I'll get her next decade.

But it's that kind of thing. Very few people actually meet our criteria. And when they do, it's not easy to land them. And I've been doing this pursuing of really good directors for a lot of years, and it's a really low hit rate. Of course, you can just give some headhunters a couple of hundred grand and will get you a dozen. But they're not going to be the people you want.

Lawrence Cunningham

Well, thank you all for that series of questions. That too was a question we were going to pose later, but -- so thanks for asking ahead of time. We'll now revert to the panel's posing of questions that you had submitted in advance. And in this segment, most -- I think all the questions are going to be addressed to a particular person. I'm going to start addressing this one to Mark Leonard. And it's going to begin by saying that we all very much miss your annual shareholder letter. It's one of the things that thousands of people have looked forward to every year for a decade or more. Do you miss it, Mark? Can we ever expect to see another one?

Mark Leonard

Whenever you write something for an audience, you have to put yourself into their shoes. And one of the ways I used to write a letter was thinking about employee shareholders, and that really helped. But what I found was you also had to address other shareholders. And so in the last one, I addressed institutional shareholders. We were talking about limiting director tenure. I talked about recruiting good directors and how difficult it was. I talked about a number of things that I wouldn't talk to employee shareholders about because I just don't think they would have raised those issues or cared.

And so if I have a chance to communicate and if I have energy and time to invest in communicating, I'm going to do it with the employees and the employee shareholders. And I recognize that, that disenfranchises the other shareholders. The comfort I have is that the institutional shareholders have no idea what we do, and most of them buy our shares because they're closet-indexing and they constitute a huge proportion of our institutional shareholders. There may be 30 to 50 institutional shareholders who actually are stock pickers and long-term investors and who care what the business does, and we can have dialogue with them.

Jamal is willing to meet anyone in our offices, whether you're a big or small shareholder and talk about the company, and he's very good about doing so. And we're also happy to respond to Q&A. Although from time to time, I get busy and not very good about getting those responses out, or else, I steal them and feed them into the session here today. But there's still the ability to communicate, and I think that interactive communication that we do in the Q&A is ultimately more valuable than me proselytizing over what looks like a good Constellation employee and how they can build their career at Constellation. For most shareholders, I don't think that's the reason they read our shareholder letters. But I will continue proselytizing if they invite me to their meetings inside of the operating groups.

Lawrence Cunningham

Not incidentally, many of the questions that were submitted referenced a lot of the answers that you've provided in the Q&A. So our sense is that people appreciate that device and think it's very valuable. So thank you very much for doing that. And then I would just go across the panel posing questions to the other managers. Sanjiv?

Sanjiv Kalevar

So this next question is for Dexter and Robin, and this is in regards to offshoring, particularly R&D resources. And this is something we see in our venture capital investments as well. So can you speak to your strategy with respect to offshoring? It seems, Dexter, you have an operation in Karachi and Robin, an operation in Romania. Has that -- has the use of offshoring increased in recent years? And do you do it -- does it only lend itself to certain types of processes or business units?

Dexter Salna

Well, I'll start. And so I run a big -- the Perseus Group. And some 9 years ago, the fellow beside me acquired a company in England that had 17 people in Karachi. And there was a trusted manager that worked for me that was of Pakistani heritage. And since Barry didn't want to move to Pakistan, we chose Bilal. And that was a very difficult time for the homebuilders, and so we were under extreme pressure from the downturn. And so we naturally started to go and hire offshore because we couldn't hire onshore since our business had slumped by some 50%.

And so 9 years ago, we had 17 people. And today, there's 500 people in Contour, in our offshoring. We do everything from back-office accounting, support, R&D, QA and professional services and marketing. We do support for our M&A groups as well. And just a lot of talented people there. And we find that there's less competition for resources than in some place like India, where you have a lot of companies offshoring.

Since we have our own management staff, it's a lot -- it's more cost-effective for our groups. And so if we acquire a small company with, let's say, 10, 20 people, they can augment their staff by hiring people in our Contour group. And the way we run it, we don't have 500 bodies that are busily kind of programming, we have 500 people that are actually employees and partners of the people that we have onshore. And there's very little difference from an onshore person and an offshore person, except for where they live.

I'm very proud of our group in Pakistan, in Contour. I just came from a visit there 1.5 months ago. I interviewed some 120 employees over a period of 3 days. And the overwhelming comment from all the employees, which was, well, unprompted, was that this is the best place to work in Pakistan. So not only are we creating jobs there, we're creating good jobs, not sweatshop jobs. And it just gives them freedom to live, where in the country of their origin, working in a good job and earning a good lifestyle. And I'm very proud of kind of what we've established there.

Mark Leonard

Dexter looks terrific in a jilaba.

Robin van Poelje

Yes. We acquired a company in 2007 in Romania. The company was founded in '93, just a few years after the fall of the wall. And we celebrated last year 25 years of the presence of that company. It's now over a decade under our wings. I think we grew in that period more than 5x. And like Dexter was saying about his business in Pakistan, it's the same for us. It's not just for the economics of it, it's also for finding the right people. And I'm impressed by the people we have there. They study math, physics, computer science, so it helps us on that side. And we call it nearshoring, so in a 3-hour to -- 3-hour flight, we're there from Amsterdam to Romania. So you can communicate in modern ways these days, but just once in a while, go to see each other.

And for our business units, they can work with it. It's not mandatory. Everybody can decide themselves. We had a lot of learnings. So it's also important we only do R&D, we don't do other stuff. And it's also important, not just on the Romanian side, but also on our onshore businesses, how you make this work. So we learned a lot over the last couple of years. It's expanding. They're also doing, for the other groups, some work out of Romania. And we also do for third parties, so it's really a profit center. And they learn from lots of clients they have. And yes, I think, so far, it has been a very interesting ride for us. And I'm happy we have this as part of our portfolio.

Sanjiv Kalevar

Great. So just picking up on that then, is there an opportunity to do more offshoring at the other business units just given the successes that have taken place with both Dexter and Robin's groups?

Dexter Salna

Well, our group in Contour or Pakistan, that employs and recruits for people throughout all of Constellation, and so we have people working there for Jonas, for Volaris, the only -- for Vela and Harris. And the only company we don't have anyone working there for is for TSS. So we've actually kind of created it as a recruiting. And the important thing is that we don't go and terminate onshore people for offshore. We augment them. And so if we're competing with a 20-person firm in North America, they cannot offshore at the same cost that we can. And so we've been able to go and competitively put ourselves in front of a lot of our smaller competitors and -- by having this offshore arm.

Sanjiv Kalevar

Okay. Thank you.

Mark Leonard

But to put it in context, that's 500 people out of 19,000. So it's not like we rip out the guts of the businesses we buy and move them to Pakistan. It's a small adjunct to what we do and it adds a certain value, and they can often tap certain skills that we find difficult to find in other geographies.

Sanjiv Kalevar

I'll pass it back over to Jon.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Great. So a couple of questions submitted for Jeff about IRS and Acceo. Starting off with Acceo, what are your early takeaways from the acquisition? And with regard to larger acquisitions, how would you describe if this has -- this specific one has impacted your approach then?

Jeff Bender

Yes. So I think, as a group, we've done a number of larger acquisitions. I think we've always been comfortable with doing them. Acceo specifically had a business organizational structure very similar to how Harris and Constellation typically run their businesses. They already had a number of business units that were getting centralized support from a central group. So that part of the integration was, I'd say, relatively seamless. So it wasn't like we had to rebuild or restructure these businesses. They were already existing, several very high-quality businesses that were there that continue to be very high-quality businesses.

So I think the main learning that I would take away from it, apart from, I think, the use of leverage, which I think it taught me and the Harris portfolio managers, or provided us maybe with understanding another tool in the toolkit, so now not just being able to use our best practices in our pricing, now there's -- we have a sort of a leverage, lever that we sort of, I think, understand more and understand what kind of value we can bring into larger-size transactions that help us to be more successful and more competitive in the pricing.

I just think, again, it's just been -- it's been a great business, great people, really solidified our business in QuÃ©bec, so on the province of QuÃ©bec in Canada. We are now a substantial employer, and I think that's actually helped us uncover many other. I think back then, it was John sort of saying once you get deeper and deeper into a geography, whether that geography is one of the Canadian provinces, just more and more companies are becoming available. And we're becoming aware of them, and I think that's obviously great for our future capital deployment.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Great. Thank you. And for Harris overall, last year, you discussed an ambitious goal for organic growth by 2020. Can you provide an update on how that's gone so far and what the puts and takes have been by sub-verticals?

Jeff Bender

So I think if I was to summarize overall, I think we put together a chart at one of our last meetings. So I think, again, in rough numbers, I think 1/3 of our businesses will clearly be able to achieve 20 by 2020. 1/3 of our businesses have the opportunity and perhaps will feel comfortable that it is still within their sights. And I would say 1/3 of our businesses will not come anywhere close to achieving 20 by 2020, which I think is about what I expected going into it. It wasn't -- again, it wasn't as much about picking the number. The number just -- it just sounds good, 20 by 2020, like that. It really wasn't like this massive logic other than we sort of -- we did look at a number of our businesses and said, can we compound growth by 6% per year? That didn't seem like an unreasonable amount of growth to be asking our businesses for.

So the idea was more about reengaging every single business and all of our employees about thinking about organic growth, right? That was the genesis of why we sort of -- we tried to sort of crystallize it as a program and make it part of what we talked about on a regular basis.

If I split it out by vertical, I would say the utilities verticals are probably going to be mostly in the top third category, or most of them have clear paths to 20 by 2020. It's a solid franchise. It's been growing well for a number of years. The local government business probably has a mixture of maybe half of those businesses, clearly have a nice path, others do not. And our health care businesses would definitely be falling in the latter bucket given the attrition challenges that they're facing. They -- none of them tried -- I don't think any of the -- maybe a company and a couple of smaller ones. Most of those businesses would not be -- sort of being able to achieve the 20 by 2020.

But again, not really unexpected, but if I look at, actually, the amount of conversations, the quality of conversations, the initiative, the try, call it, trying. You just need to try. You won't get fired unless you're not trying. Though, the health care group has actually, if I would say, actually done the best job of actually trying harder to find new ways to grow and of trying to find different niches for them to be in. To Mark's point, taking their share of wallet from 1% to a slightly bigger percent, they've done a phenomenal job of doing that.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Great. Thank you. Before I hand it back over to Sanjiv, there's one question I'd like to ask of Robin with regard to TSS. And the submission here asked if TSS employees have a similar policy with regard to investing their bonuses in CSI stock as other employees within Constellation do. Or is there a different structure for TSS employees?

Robin van Poelje

No. We have exactly the same system as our colleagues have. It was new to us. So we're trying to educate and train the European socialist into becoming a little bit more capitalist. So far, being part of TSS, I think they love it. And yes, I think people made certain amounts of money, which was new to them. We had some debate about it. I still think people come to work for other stuff as well, but I think here we do exactly the same, and it has been, I think, well received so far.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Great. Thank you. All righty. This next question is for John and Dexter. So what's your assessment of the current capital deployment environment? And assuming it hasn't changed too much from this morning when it was described as competitive, what changes -- any changes that you can share that you anticipate over the next recent while to compete in this environment?

John Billowits

Yes. I'll start, Dexter, if you don't mind. So I think it is competitive in certain markets and in certain sizes. In fact, in every market, once you go beyond a certain size of acquisition, it's very competitive. However, our sweet spot, which has still stayed relatively the same, which is mid-single-digit millions, in many markets our biggest competitor is ourselves. And that has not changed, which is good news. However, in other verticals and geographies where, particularly in the U.S., if a financial player has bought a platform and has decided to do a roll-up of many small companies, then we tend not to participate in those. We look for other opportunities. But for our core market in -- outside the U.S., and even in the U.S., there's not a roll-up being done, we still are -- we don't come across same competitor more than a few times a year. So we're still, from my perspective anyways, doing a good job finding opportunities there.

And over the next 3 to 5 years, I think I'll echo what I said earlier, we -- as we step out into new geographies, we're finding the environment better than typically North America with respect to competition. And are we worried of the emulators or people trying to copy us doing the same thing? I think our experience curve is just so far beyond the emulators, and we continue to add to it every time we enter a new market. I think it's going to take a long time to catch up. It's relatively easy to find a prospect. It's very difficult to close them and even more difficult to own them for a long period of time. And I think as Mark Miller said at the beginning, I mean, the -- you can hire a lot of M&A professionals, but you cannot close a deal with an M&A professional. If you do, you get pretty nervous about what happened. You really do need the -- you need a whole level of different types of people talking to that prospect and gaining their trust over a number of years and then integrating that business moving forward. So I personally feel pretty good about our reach-out into all these new geographies and the ability to grow for the next 5 to 10 years because of that reach-out.

Dexter Salna

I find kind of investing, it's a long-term strategy. And so you'll have times where you can allocate a lot of capital at high rates of return and then other times when you're fighting against some financial buyers that don't have the same restrictions on return. But being in the business now 24 years, there'll be times, good times and bad times, and you just have to be patient to wait out those times where you have people applying more money than they should against companies that they don't know a lot about. And so I look at our homebuilder group and, in particular, we've been acquiring competitors in homebuilders. And so all of a sudden, we have a lot more competition. And so they're buying up a lot of the smaller companies and they don't really kind of know what they're buying or what the dynamics are. And in the next kind of cycle of homebuilding, we'll probably be on the doorstep and buy those at that time. So it's just a matter of patience.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Thanks.

Lawrence Cunningham

Okay. I've got a quick change of pace here. Jon, Sanjiv, you know us reasonably well. What do you think our toughest challenges are over the next little while? What's the biggest risk? What do you -- what scares you about Constellation?

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

I'd say for me, I think it's a continuation of the competitive theme. To the extent that capital remains readily available, I think there will continue to be perhaps increasingly be competitors that are not as disciplined about hurdle rates at which they deploy capital, which challenges the ability for Constellation to continue to grow the amount of capital deployed and the rates of return earned on capital deployed. I think that's the biggest trend, and it's something that's outside of Constellation's control.

Sanjiv Kalevar

Yes. I mean think I would echo a lot of that. I think it's the laws of large numbers as the numbers are, like, much larger, doing a number of deals and continuing to preserve that over time just becomes increasingly harder to do as many number of companies. And there is increased competition from a lot of the cloud vendors, although I do think there's plenty of more on-premise software vendors that are -- still remain out there.

Lawrence Cunningham

Well, a final couple of questions in this segment before moving on to Part 6 on personnel are to Mark Miller. The first is a question that says, "One of Trapeze's great assets is demand-response paratransit software. Today, Uber and Lyft may integrate into that software, but could they one day obviate the need for this product?"

Mark Miller

Yes. And the -- definitely, there's been private providers of you'd say pickup and dropoff demand-responsive software that have entered the market, and taxis are commonly used to deliver passengers. The good news, you can sort of separate the, what you'd call, the dispatching and scheduling of people's rides from all of the things that a city needs to do in order to transport those passengers. There's many different people paying for the service. There's also self-reporting mechanisms and interfaces that, my guess is, the Ubers and the Lyfts and any of the other providers won't want to deal with. So there's the actually moving people around and there's all the things that wrap around deciding who's eligible, who's not eligible to take the demand-responsive service. And there's a lot of complexity with that and -- so especially in the larger cities where a good source of Trapeze's revenue would come from. In that particular area, they're really complicated.

Lawrence Cunningham

Final question for you, Mark. Volaris has combined some groups into vertically focused subgroups or brands, such as Cultura for agri-food, equivant for justice, Trapeze. Could you discuss the level of integration that you seek within a specific vertical once it gets to a certain size?

Mark Miller

Yes, really not. In fact, like, if I was going to play it all again back from 1995, I would have less used the Trapeze brand name as we moved into and acquired more transit software businesses. I don't like having these global brands that are attached to a particular vertical market because I believe when you take away the brand of a company when you acquired it, it rips part of the soul out of the company. And I think when you're in our situation, once it's going to be functionally integrated, when you're buying and you're holding forever, having a separate team with a separate identity, even if it is in a market that we already own other businesses, is very, very, very important and allows them to think about how they can innovate with their customers to grow their business and any potential functional tuck-ins that they could do to grow their businesses over time.

Lawrence Cunningham

Good. This is our nearly final section, Part 6. We call it personnel.

Mark Leonard

This is why we call you long-term shareholders.

Lawrence Cunningham

Thanks for staying around. We appreciate your patience. I think there was a budget of about 3 hours. Some of the managers...

Mark Leonard

That was the stretched budget.

Lawrence Cunningham

I'd say keep it at 2 or somewhere in between. So we'll try to wrap it up, but there are some important questions in this section so I think we've got to cover them. I'll start. And this poser or this person asking the question seem to want an answer from all 6 of the group managers. So we keep it very brief without getting into details. Just how do you allocate your time or your priorities between M&A activity, talent development, strategy? Just very briefly, how do you -- percentage of your time is allocated to the aspects of your jobs.

Robin van Poelje

I would say 10%, 20% coaching all the people reporting up to me. You can call it talent development. And then I try to, once in a while, think some things through and do some stuff, 20%, and I think 60% of my time is on M&A.

Dexter Salna

As we've kind of grown larger and larger, proportionately more of my time gets spent on M&A. I would say that 70% is on M&A. Also, kind of coaching new employees into the business is very important for future leaders. The way I look at it last year -- if I look at the first year of Perseus, last year, we added more businesses than we had in the initial year. And so it's getting more and more important to bring in talented young people that can be the managers of tomorrow. And so same as Robin, probably 70% on M&A and the other 30% on talent development and coaching.

Barry Symons

I would probably be in that -- I'll keep it very brief. I'd be in that kind of 60% range on M&A and the other 40% be split between talent development and strategy.

Jeff Bender

Yes. I'd say I'm probably 50% capital deployment, 30% coaching, which would include operational coaching, so for businesses that are struggling; and then probably 20% split between, I guess, on strategy and specific focus on organic growth.

Mark Miller

So I'd say 50-50 sort of HR and M&A, but much of the M&A time is spent coaching, obviously, because you're working with leaders, we're deploying capital trying to coach them. So -- though it's a bit of a hard line to draw in the sand there.

John Billowits

Yes. Obviously, we're at about 30% to 50% M&A, but increasingly, people development and recruitment in particular, and development of best practice sharing between our groups.

Lawrence Cunningham

Thank you all. Thank you very much. I think that's illuminating. Next questions will come from Sanjiv.

Sanjiv Kalevar

Yes. Again, questions for the operating managers. How do you ensure that the business unit managers maintain a long-term orientation? Yes, I'll start with that, and then I'll have a follow-up.

John Billowits

Visit them as often -- sorry, as infrequently as possible.

Mark Leonard

The panel thought that was funny.

John Billowits

The -- so I think we've done a good job retraining -- retaining our business unit managers. They tend to be highly focused in the vertical that they're in. So they love that vertical, they grew up in it. They also tend to have been the #2 in the business or #3 in the business. Oftentimes, when someone sells to us, and the older manager, they may stick around for a period of time, but it's a retirement vehicle for them. So we give that second or third person an opportunity to do something with the tremendous amount of coaching and best practices that they would never been exposed to before. And they love it for the most part. And if you do well and they actually want to, they can then use that skill set to coach other managers coming into the business. So I think we offer them a tremendous opportunity for a great career. They can either be a craftsman and do what they love to do for the rest of their career or they can dramatically do different things within CSI that they would never been able to do in their -- in the previous ownership.

Mark Miller

Yes. I'd say very much similar as what John would say, I think. You keep people long term and get them to think long term if you give them the ability to have control of their destiny, what they're doing and learn from the rest of the organization. So I think those are kind of...

p id="27483910" name="Jeff Bender" type="E" />

We have a set of meetings that happen once per year where we just require the business leader to talk about the future. They don't -- sort of they wanted to talk about the short term and the past, we make them talk about the future.

Sanjiv Kalevar

Sounds good. So just following up on that. John, your comment around how frequently you visit the business unit managers. Do the different GMs have different styles in terms of actively monitoring the BUs? And are some operating groups more or less decentralized? And can you talk about those differences why?

John Billowits

I'll start. I can tell you what we do, which is we do what we call quarterly strategic reviews, which is a review of each business each quarter. And we do those face-to-face only once per year, and the rest of them is just really submission of a PowerPoint and a few Q&As. And that's kind of how we do it and I know each of the guys do it slightly differently. So...

Jeff Bender

Yes. I think our CFO would run a, I think it's a couple times a month now, call with each business to review results and short-term forecast. And then I would visit or we would get together in a central location every single business once per year for about 5 or 6 hours.

Sanjiv Kalevar

That was good. Pass it over to Jon.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Thanks. And I think I'll wrap up this section with a few questions. First, Mark, a question that the OGMs were asked just a few minutes ago. Can you just give an update on how you're currently allocating your time in spending the day at CSI?

Mark Leonard

Q1 was anomalous. I went to Japan and spent 5 weeks there, working on M&A. And I usually have projects, and one of the things that comes out of managers meetings when we get together as a group is a list of future studies that we'd like to do, and I try and knock 1 or 2 of them off and I try and add 3 or 4 to the list every quarter. And those projects can be enormous. So for instance, we're doing one on attrition. And I'm just totally overwhelmed by the amount of work involved in doing a long-term look at post-acquisition attrition. But they can also be very short. So we did one on digital marketing, and I just polled the groups and polled together their responses, and that was easy to knock off. And hopefully by sharing results, we know where within Constellation to go to get expertise on digital marketing, and who's doing the most of it, and how it stacks up against some outside companies. So it's project-driven, it's not easy to forecast.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Okay. And second, turning to the newer role of Vice Chairman of the Board, which Larry has received. Can you talk a little bit about what you envision the responsibilities of the Vice Chairman to be and how it impacts you as Chairman?

Mark Leonard

He basically handles everything I don't like. It's the same role I have for everyone else, by the way.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Sounds good. Sounds like that's a value-add for you.

Mark Leonard

No. Basically, it's a way of doing stuff that I wasn't getting to, like polling the Board on a regular basis, the things they're interested in and prioritizing those and for staying in touch with some of the more governance-oriented of the inquiries that institutional investors can surface and making sure that we have responses that are not what might appear cavalier if I were to give them.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Great. And Mark, one last one for you. So while I think everyone here hopes this won't be necessary for a long period of time, perhaps an infinite one similar to your margin of safety. Would it be possible for you to share your thoughts on succession planning? Has anything been discussed? If so, anything that you're comfortable sharing?

Mark Leonard

If they're plotting behind my back, let me know.

Lawrence Cunningham

We had dinner last night.

Mark Leonard

So my intention is to keep working as long as I can add value and as long as people that I know and trust tell me that I continue to add value. And hopefully they won't be too emotional about it. And when I do start drooling into the chips, they'll kick me out.

Jonathan Salinas; Hound Partners; COO

Great. Good for me.

Lawrence Cunningham

We've got amazing, amazingly deep bench of talent here. So I think the future of Constellation is bright under any circumstance. If we've got a few more minutes, if we've got patience for a few more minutes so just a few final questions. Do we have a few minutes, Mark?

Mark Leonard

Doesn't sound like he's giving us a choice. Besides which, I want to see who the real hold-outs are, the people who are going to...

Lawrence Cunningham

This is -- I mean...

Mark Leonard

\[ But if feels good \]â€¦

Lawrence Cunningham

\[ Feel free to \] take 1 minute or all day, but here's the question. Since it's been posed, we've asked almost every question. Here's one. If you could instantly change something about CSI culture or its business model, you had the magic wand, what would it be?

Mark Leonard

I'm not answering that.

Mark Miller

I'll tell you what -- what really -- what frustrates me is that when I spoke about earlier is how little of our customers' operating expense we really are and how much more we could do for them. Getting our leaders inside of our businesses that have been sometimes working in that business for 20, 30 years to believe that is really hard because it's their business they started up. They think they're already charging a lot for what they're doing and they're comfortable with the products they have and they incrementally improve them slowly over time. But they don't make big leaps into other areas of the customer. And if we could do that, it would be fabulous inside of the organization. And I just really believe that would be the thing if could change, it would be -- because you'd get deeper into customers, there's barriers to entry, all of those things, right, add more value. So that's why it's going to drive organic growth. You're going to be able to hire better employees. It just kind of like snowballs into it. And it's such a hard message to get through and so few of our business leaders do it and they don't do customer observation as well as they could, our good business leaders. But our good business leaders isn't 60%, 70% of our lead. It's 10%. We can make that 15% or 20%, it may change. I just wish there's a magic wand.

Mark Leonard

And Mark knows of which he speaks and that he came from Trapeze. They were doing fixed route scheduling for transit authorities. Transit sucks. It's -- people ridership has been dropping for God knows how long. It's a tough business. Yet you look at the growth, the organic growth of Trapeze, and it's astonishing and it's consistent and it's just remarkable. And it's stepping out from working for one department to working for department after department after department inside of those transit authorities, becoming a trusted vendor, a respected vendor to the industry. It's just -- it's exactly the story he was telling.

Lawrence Cunningham

Well, there are no more takers on the magic wand. The panel has completed our work. We want to thank the main panel over here and all of you for listening and participating today, and thanks for all the shareholders.

Mark Leonard

Thank you very much. There are no further comments. I'm going to dash for the door. Hope you all have a safe trip home. Bye-bye.
