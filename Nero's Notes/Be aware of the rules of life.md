# Be Aware of the Rules of Life

- You can choose what games you play, but you cannot change their rules.
- Any problem grows until you notice it (i.e until it hurts).
- The very important is never urgent.
- Meta-Practice : you should practice your practice
- Do not think that your problem is different unless you have already applied the solution that works for everyone else for at least three months.
