A strong corporate culture constitutes  an intangible asset, potentially as valuable as a high profile brand or network of customer relationships.

As Buffett says:
> If we are delighting customers, eliminating unnecessary costs and improving our products and services, we gain strength... On a daily basis, the effects are imperceptible; cumulatively though, their consequences  are enormous. When our long-term competitive position improves as a result of these almost unnoticeable actions, we describe the phenomenon as *widening the moat*...


Good management recognizes that a top priority is developing and deploying people who will then help achieve an organization's goals. Some corporate cultures are famous for creating great managers. In the US for instance, at least 26 former General Electric executives became chief executives at other large companies while at least 18 IBM executives have become such leaders. In Europe, at least four former executives of Atlas Copco went on to lead other major companies, including Alfa Laval, ASSA ABLOY, Munters, and Wärtislä.
While training and grooming practices vary, at Atlas Copco the practice is to rotate executives every three years through a series of roles to expose them to multiple perspectives on the business.

Quality companies tend to have a strong sense of culture based on a strong set of common values that drive success. These values vary by company, but examples include cost consciousness  for a low-cost provider (see [[Frugal Corporate Cultures]]), [[Spending more money on employees]], scientific curiosity for a research-driven company, and team-spirit in collaborative production businesses such as providing third-party certifications of credit quality or financial reporting.

In probing culture, we consult management, of course, bu we equally value input from other corporate constituents. Suppliers or customers can describe execution experiences that reflect on a company's priorities, norms and values. Former employees can reveal hidden traits worth uncovering. While they and others may have their own agendas in discussing corporate culture, collecting a large number of perspectives typically facilitates a reliable snapshot.
