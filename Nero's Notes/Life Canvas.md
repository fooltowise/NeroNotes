# Life Canvas


## Principles
- [[Lessons from Mohnish Pabrai | Mohnish Pabrai]]: Clone what works
- [[Nick Sleep and Qais Zackaria | Nick Sleep]]: When something is worth doing, it's worth doing well.
- Daniel Gilbert: We are very bad at predicting what will make us happy. Two consequences:
	-  It is much easier (and better) to remove unhappiness than to actively seek things that make us happy
	- When something looks interesting/potentially fulfilling, contact someone who is already in that position to figure out how his day-to-day life looks like.
- [[Jonny Wilkinson on High Performance | Jonny Wilkinson]]: 
	- Be present at the present task and give it your all. Be fully engaged. See [[Characteristics of  Flow | Flow]].
	- Let go of your old identity. What you have been through does not define who you are.
	- How you see yourself translates to what you can create in the world.
	- There is nothing more powerful than passion, excitement and a willingness to learn.
	- Explore. That's it. Versus control. As soon as you're on controlling, it's a decision that I know how things should be. And from there it goes downhills.
- Jake Humphrey: Don't live a goal-focused life. The brain is wired in such a way that as soon as it will reach its goal, it will look for another one and never be really fulfilled. Instead, live a process-focused life. Thrive to be better everyday.
- [[Choose your Role Models]]
- [[Derek Sivers]] : 
	- If you don't learn to focus, you will have a shallow and unrewarding life without any meaningful achievement. [[Master Something]].
	- Don't be a donkey. Do one thing for a few years, then another for a few years, then another. [[Reinvent Yourself Regularly]].
	- I've optimised my life for creating and learning.
- [[Writing is Networking for Introverts]]
- Aim high, but reward yourself for small incremental improvements, especially when they repeat every day.
- Tim Ferriss - [[Productivity Tricks]]
